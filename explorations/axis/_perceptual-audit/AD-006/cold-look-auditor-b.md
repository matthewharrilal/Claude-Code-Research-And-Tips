# Cold Look — Auditor B (Readability + Responsiveness)
## AD-006: Compound Axis — The Convergence

---

## 1440px Cold Look

**Gut reaction:** Sophisticated, editorial. The dark header band with serif title feels confident and weighted. The cream body is warm and inviting. There is a clear sense of hierarchy: dark cinematic banner, then warm cream body, then a section header with serif heading and mono label above it. Very readable at first glance.

**Worst thing:** The body text column in Section 01 is noticeably narrower than the full width available. The paragraph sits in what feels like a two-thirds-or-less column next to the pattern icon grid, and the text wraps more frequently than it should. At this wide a screen, the reading column could breathe more.

**Best thing:** The section header system (mono uppercase label, then large serif heading, then lighter intro paragraph) is extremely clear. The pattern icon grid is charming -- six small dark squares with red accent lines, each a miniature of its axis pattern. Both decorative and informative.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## 768px Cold Look

**Gut reaction:** BROKEN. The bento grid section is catastrophically narrow in its featured column -- text stacks vertically, one character per line. Multiple viewport-sized areas of the lower half of the page are blank cream with no content. This does not feel designed for this width.

**Worst thing:** The featured "Compound Axis" bento card collapses to an impossibly thin sliver. Text literally reads one character per line vertically: "Z, F, B, e, n, t, o, S, p, i, r, a, l, a, n, d, C, h, o..." This is the canonical bento-grid failure mode, and it is severe. Multiple viewports of this stacked text exist.

**Best thing:** The header, Section 01, and Section 02 prose content still read acceptably. The body text at 768px has good line length for prose paragraphs.

**Ship verdict:** NO -- broken layout makes the bento section unreadable.

## 1024px Cold Look

**Gut reaction:** Mixed. The header and first two sections feel competent. But the bento grid has an oversized featured card with enormous blank space inside it. Sections below have massive vertical gaps -- entire viewports of blank cream.

**Worst thing:** The featured bento card is a hollow red-bordered rectangle with almost no visible text content inside. The imbalance between this oversized empty card and the small filled cards next to it is jarring.

**Best thing:** Top of the page (header through Section 02) reads well. The three-column "Organization / Density / Axis" comparison cards are clear and well-proportioned.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS -- readable but the excessive whitespace and bento card imbalance hurt.

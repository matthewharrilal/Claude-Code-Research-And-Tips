# Cold Look — Auditor A (Impression + Emotion)
## AD-006: The Convergence (Compound Axis)

## 1440px Cold Look

**Gut reaction:** Confident and scholarly. The dark header band with warm serif title feels authoritative and deliberate. The transition from dark header into warm cream body is clean and grounded. There is a textbook quality — serious but not cold. The small pattern-icon grid on the right side of the first section is charming, almost like stamps or woodcuts.

**Worst thing:** The body content below the header feels adrift. The left text column and the right icon grid sit beside each other but do not feel in conversation — they float independently. The section label ("SECTION 01 — Z-PATTERN OVERVIEW") is very small and easy to miss, creating a weak entry point into the first section. The gap between the header band and the first section content is large enough to feel like a pause, but not large enough to feel intentional as a breathing zone.

**Best thing:** The title treatment. "AD-006: The Convergence" in warm serif against the dark band is the strongest element and should be protected at all costs. The axis indicator bar (COMPOUND / FRACTAL / CREATIVE) is clean, confident, and unobtrusive. The red accent on the pattern icons gives the page its only color punctuation and is well-calibrated.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

**Gut reaction:** The layout has NOT adapted — it looks essentially identical to the wide version, just with narrower effective reading width from margins. This is a missed opportunity. Multi-column layouts that were airy at wide widths become cramped without reflowing. The bento cards in Section 3 squeeze into two columns that feel crowded, and the featured "Compound Axis" card creates a tall empty bordered column because its height is driven by adjacent shorter cards rather than its own content.

**Worst thing:** The featured bento card at 768 creates a tall empty red-bordered rectangle. It looks like a layout error, not a design choice.

**Best thing:** Tables remain legible. The transition grammar table (Smooth/Bridge/Breathing) reads cleanly. Callout boxes maintain their proportions well.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS (content that IS visible is solid, but dead zones persist)

**Gut reaction:** This is the sweet spot width for Section 02. The three-column "Three Perspectives" section (Organization / Density / Axis) looks its best here — cards have room, text wraps naturally, the colored underlines feel proportional. Header treatment is well-sized.

**Worst thing:** Same dead-zone pattern between sections. Large blank cream expanses persist at every width.

**Best thing:** The "Three Perspectives, One Reality" cards at this width are the best-looking element across all viewports examined. Clean columns, readable text, good spacing.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

# Cold Look — AD-003 Bento Grid — Alpha (Impression + Readability + Spatial)

## COLD LOOK (1440px)

**Gut reaction:** The page feels authoritative and well-structured at the top — the dark header with warm cream body is a strong handoff — but the lower portion where the "bento grid" cards actually appear feels like a wireframe that never got its second pass of polish.

**Worst thing:** The bento grid cards just barely peeking in at the bottom — "Create the Grid Container" and "Set Cell" — are cut off and already look cramped, and the fact that this page is ABOUT bento grids but the hero section is a plain text block with a table feels like a missed opportunity. The page doesn't embody what it teaches.

**Best thing:** The header band is confident — dark, warm, well-spaced, with the exploration label and version badge sitting comfortably. The title and subtitle have good breathing room and the italic serif font gives it personality without being precious.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## COLD LOOK (768px)

**Gut reaction:** Surprisingly, the page feels almost identical to the wide version — the grid hasn't collapsed. The narrower viewport actually helps readability in the flowing text sections, but the bento grid cards are now cramped, with code blocks truncating and narrow columns forcing text into vertical stacking.

**Worst thing:** The grid doesn't collapse to single column. At 768px the cards are still in multi-column layout, which means narrow cards get even narrower. Text in the "TIP" callout is stacking one thought per line. Code blocks are truncated. The page itself says the grid should collapse below 768px — it doesn't practice what it preaches.

**Best thing:** The header and the flowing prose sections (section introductions, the Essence callout, the Verification section) actually read better at this width. The line lengths feel more natural and the text doesn't float in too much whitespace.

**Ship verdict:** NO — The grid fails to collapse at its own stated breakpoint. Cards are too cramped at this width.

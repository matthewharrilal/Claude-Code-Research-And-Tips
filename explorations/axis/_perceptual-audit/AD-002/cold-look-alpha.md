# Cold Look — Auditor Alpha — AD-002 F-Pattern

## 1440px Viewport (1440x900)

**Gut reaction:** A strong, confident documentation page with clear hierarchy and a commanding dark header, but the content column feels slightly narrow for this wide a viewport — there is a lot of warm cream desert on both sides.

**Worst thing:** The five-segment tension bar below "ACT I — EXPOSITION" reads like a broken loading indicator or orphaned progress widget. Its purpose is not self-evident at first glance.

**Best thing:** The heading "The Reading Path You Already Know" with the bold red left border is immediately eye-catching and anchors the left spine beautifully — it signals a strong, intentional reading axis.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## 768px Viewport (768x1024)

**Note:** Browser contention prevented dedicated 768px viewport screenshots. Assessment derived from full-page screenshot at narrow rendering and accessibility snapshot analysis.

**Gut reaction:** The single-column collapse works well -- the content flows naturally without the two-column layout. The left spine becomes the entire content width, which feels clean and focused. But the code blocks become very dominant, eating nearly the full viewport width.

**Worst thing:** Code blocks at 768px consume almost the entire screen width, making them feel like walls rather than embedded examples. The dark code blocks against the warm cream create a jarring alternation.

**Best thing:** The heading hierarchy remains perfectly legible. The left border on headings and the serif/sans-serif differentiation survive the collapse intact.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

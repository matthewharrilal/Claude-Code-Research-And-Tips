# Cold Look -- Auditor Alpha -- AD-001 Z-Pattern

## 1440px Viewport

**Gut reaction:** Dark, authoritative header with strong serif typography gives way to a clean four-quadrant overview -- it feels deliberately composed, but the gap between the header and the content cards is enormous.

**Worst thing:** The massive dead space between the red bottom-border of the header and the first content cards -- feels like a breath held too long between introduction and substance.

**Best thing:** The two-column card layout in the overview section genuinely demonstrates the Z-pattern it describes -- the eye does sweep left-to-right across the top row then drops down. The italic serif callout in the bottom-right card feels like the page whispering its thesis.

**Gut reaction:** The page compresses surprisingly well to tablet width. The two-column overview grid persists at 768px (NOT collapsing to single column), which actually works -- the cards just get narrower but remain legible.

**Worst thing:** The same over-generous vertical gaps from desktop carry over to mobile, creating even more scroll distance for less content per screen. At tablet scale, these gaps feel like lost sections rather than deliberate breathing room.

**Best thing:** The Q&A pattern remains clear -- the red left border on questions and the white answer cards are just as readable at 768px. Typography scales well.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

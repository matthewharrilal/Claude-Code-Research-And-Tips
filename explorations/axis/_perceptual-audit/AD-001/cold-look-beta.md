# Cold Look — Auditor Beta (AD-001 Z-Pattern)

**Gut reaction:** Stately and intentional — the dark header commands attention and the two-column card layout below immediately suggests a structured, considered layout with clear left-right pairing.

**Worst thing:** The bottom-left card (metadata: Axis, Paired OD, Density, Findings) feels like a raw data dump — monospaced text floating in a large bordered card with no visual refinement.

**Best thing:** The header typography is commanding — large, elegant serif title with warm cream text on near-black, creating immediate authority and personality.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

**Gut reaction:** Surprisingly similar to desktop — the two-column Z-pattern overview grid persists at 768px, which gives it a slightly cramped but still structured feeling. The Q&A sections below are single-column and breathe well.

**Worst thing:** The Z-pattern overview grid cards feel squeezed at this width — the "Key Properties" card text is tight against its borders. The metadata card in the bottom-left row is also cramped.

**Best thing:** The Q&A conversational rhythm actually reads better at this width — the question-answer pairs stack vertically in a natural dialogue flow, and the narrower text column makes for comfortable line lengths.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

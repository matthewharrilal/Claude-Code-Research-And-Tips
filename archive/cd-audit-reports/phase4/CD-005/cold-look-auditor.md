# Cold Look -- CD-005 Multi-Axis Transition

## 1440px Cold Look

**Gut Reaction:** This feels like a serious, well-organized technical document. The dark header grounds me immediately. I see "Testing Strategy" and know exactly what this page is about. The content below flows into term definitions with colored left-edge markers -- purple for Essence, blue for Context, red for Term -- alongside definition blocks. It feels structured and intentional, like a textbook that respects its reader.

**Worst Thing:** The definition blocks create a zigzag layout -- the "Unit Test" label sits left with its definition block floating right, while "Integration Test" reverses this arrangement. The zigzag feels deliberate (like a Z-pattern) but the asymmetry makes each pair feel slightly off-balance. The eye must jump from left accent bar to right content block to left content block to right accent bar.

**Best Thing:** The Essence callout is gorgeous. Purple accent bar, italic serif text, generous breathing room around it. It announces itself as the philosophical heart of the section without shouting. The weight contrast between the bold "ESSENCE" label and the delicate italic body text is particularly well handled.

**Ship Verdict:** I would ship this at desktop width. It feels professional, considered, and the three-zone promise (Z-pattern overview, F-pattern deep dive, Bento grid reference) is clearly articulated in the header. The page knows what it wants to be.

**Gut Reaction:** The narrow viewport handles the Z-pattern section beautifully. The term/definition pairs maintain their side-by-side arrangement but compress gracefully. The header stacks tightly but remains readable. The Essence callout still has its purple accent bar and italic text, breathing comfortably even at this width.

**Worst Thing:** The term/definition zigzag at narrow width makes the eye work harder. The Integration Test definition box sits left while its label sits right -- at this width the content blocks are close together, making the zigzag feel more cramped than elegant.

**Best Thing:** No horizontal overflow anywhere in the Z-pattern section. Content reflows naturally. The text remains readable without horizontal scrolling.

**Ship Verdict:** Mostly ship-ready. The bento grid section appears to reflow into a workable stacked layout, addressing the Phase 2 CRITICAL finding. The massive trailing blank space below the footer is the biggest issue.

**Gut Reaction:** The tablet width feels like the sweet spot for this page. The Z-pattern zigzag has enough room to breathe without feeling wasteful. The Essence callout sits naturally within the content width. Everything feels proportionate and confident.

**Worst Thing:** Same trailing dead space below the footer as other viewports.

**Best Thing:** The balance between content width and margins feels most natural at this size.

**Ship Verdict:** Would ship. This is the page's best viewport.

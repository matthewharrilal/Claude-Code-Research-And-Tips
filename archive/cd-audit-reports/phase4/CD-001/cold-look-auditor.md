# CD-001 Cold Look — Perceptual Auditor

## COLD LOOK (1440px)

**Gut reaction:** This feels like a serious, well-structured teaching document. The dark header is commanding, the section labels ("Opening -- Context") are clearly signposted, and the density meter (1/5 with the red bar) is an immediately interesting device. The warm cream background and the dark header create a strong tonal separation. It reads like a thoughtful, purposeful page — not showy, but confident.

**Worst thing:** The body text stops about two-thirds of the way across the page and there is a large empty right third. The content channel feels narrow relative to the generous viewport width. That right-side emptiness reads as wasted real estate — especially since the header text spans the same narrow width but the hero block itself is full-bleed.

**Best thing:** The density meter is genuinely clever — it sets expectations about the content weight coming up. The pullquote at the bottom ("The middleware does not trust the request...") with its blue left accent is elegant and grounded. The section labeling system ("Opening -- Context") reads like wayfinding in a museum. This structure should be protected.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## COLD LOOK (768px)

**Gut reaction:** Much denser and more engaging at this width. The content fills the viewport better — text runs nearly edge to edge within comfortable margins. The hero, section header, body text, callout, pullquote, and next section header all visible in one tall screen. This feels like reading a quality article on a tablet. The page makes much more sense at this width than at the wide viewport.

**Worst thing:** The transition between the cream content area and the darker pullquote band is abrupt — there is a thin horizontal line separating them that feels like a structural seam rather than a designed transition. The gap between the Context callout and the pullquote band is noticeable empty space.

**Best thing:** The text column width at this viewport is nearly perfect for reading. Every paragraph feels like it belongs, and the density meter reads clearly. The hierarchy from hero to section label to heading to body to callout flows naturally.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## COLD LOOK (1024px)

**Gut reaction:** This is the goldilocks viewport. The content channel feels intentional at this width — not too narrow as at the wide viewport, not edge-to-edge as at the narrow one. The hero through Context callout fits in one screen. This feels like the "designed for" width. The text is comfortable, the spacing is confident, the hierarchy reads clearly.

**Worst thing:** The right side still has noticeable empty space, though less jarring than at the wide viewport. The transition from the warm cream into the darker pullquote band is slightly visible at the very bottom — that structural seam between sections remains.

**Best thing:** The proportions feel right. The content column width, the heading sizes relative to body text, the callout box width relative to the text column — everything feels purposefully sized. The density meter is readable and the red accent bar on the heading is clear.

**Ship verdict:** YES

Tier: A | Batch: 7 | Generated: 2026-02-06

1. WHY THIS EXISTS
Retroactive research audit that systematically evaluates all 6 Density Design
explorations (DD-001 through DD-006) against the full 388-finding research base
(R1-R5 plus synthesis and anti-patterns). Created 2026-02-04 as the most
thorough cross-referencing document in the audit chain, mapping every applicable
finding to every DD exploration. Unique authority as the per-DD cross-matrix
showing exactly which research was applied, missed, or not applicable.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
"For each DD exploration, which specific research findings were applied, which were missed, and what is the complete compliance matrix?"

3. STATUS
LOCKED — complete audit record, no modifications expected

4. SOUL ALIGNMENT
Soul-adjacent — validates that soul-derived constraints (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none, serif italic, KortAI palette) are expressed in each DD exploration by cross-referencing against research findings that define those constraints.

5. BUILT ON
| Dependency                              | Relationship                          |

6. MUST HONOR
- Finding IDs must match actual research file content (R3-001 format)
- Applicability ratings (YES/NO/MAYBE/CRITICAL) reflect genuine analysis
- Per-DD matrices must cover all 6 explorations without gaps

7. WHAT BREAKS IF THIS CHANGES
HIGH blast radius — this is the authoritative finding-to-DD mapping.
| Affected File                           | Impact                                |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| checkpoints/DD-REAUDIT-PERCEPTUAL-SYNTHESIS.md | Loses research cross-reference for scoring |
| checkpoints/DD-REAUDIT-CHECKPOINT.md    | Loses audit foundation for re-audit phase |
| checkpoints/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md          | Applied/unapplied tracking becomes unreliable |

8. CONSUMED BY
| Consumer                                | How Used                              |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| (LEAF NODE — standalone audit record)   | Not directly cited by other files; serves as authoritative reference during DD re-audit work and future research application verification |

9. RESEARCH DEBT
- cited field is empty: no known downstream consumers reference this file directly
- R-4 (192 findings) applicability analysis may be incomplete — only subset checked
- Per-DD cross-matrix format could be extended to OD/AD/CD explorations if created

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
- Does the R3 applicable count (48/51) still match if R3 findings are updated?
- Are all 6 DD HTML files still present at their expected paths?
- Does the total research base (388 findings) match current R1-R5 file contents?
- Are the applicability ratings (YES/NO/MAYBE) consistent across DD matrices?
- Has any finding been reclassified since this audit was locked?

# STEP 5: VERDICT AND REMEDIATION PLAN

## Overall Research Application Rate

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total applicable findings | 128 |
| Findings checked per exploration | ~15-20 critical |
| Average application rate | 76% |
| Anti-patterns checked | 14 |
| Anti-patterns violated | 1 (Traffic-Light in DD-001) |

## Quality of Application

| Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| EXEMPLARY (core concept) | 6 instances | - |
| Well Applied (YES) | 85% average | - |
| Partially Applied | 12% average | - |
| Missing but Should Be | 3% average | - |

## INCLUDE Decisions — Validation

| Exploration | Original | Research Rate | Anti-Patterns | Revised |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| DD-002 | INCLUDE (34) | 80% | 0 | **CONFIRMED INCLUDE** |
| DD-004 | INCLUDE (33) | 85% | 0 | **CONFIRMED INCLUDE** (potential upgrade) |
| DD-005 | INCLUDE (33.5) | 83% | 0 | **CONFIRMED INCLUDE** + innovations |
| DD-006 | INCLUDE (34.5) | 88% | 0 | **CONFIRMED INCLUDE ★★ BEST** |

## DOCUMENT Decisions — Validation

| Exploration | Original | Research Rate | Anti-Patterns | Revised |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| DD-001 | DOCUMENT (30.5) | 70% | 1 (Traffic-Light) | **CONFIRMED DOCUMENT** - needs fix |
| DD-003 | DOCUMENT (30.5) | 56% | 0-1 borderline | **CONFIRMED DOCUMENT** - needs strengthening |

## Critical Gaps Requiring Action

| Gap | Severity | Exploration | Action Required |
|-----|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Traffic-Light violation | HIGH | DD-001 | Fix by separating green/red callouts with 48px+ |
| R3-023 not fully fractal | MEDIUM | DD-001, DD-002, DD-003 | Apply rhythm within components |
| R3-037 BOOKENDS never used | LOW | Consider | OD series could use this |
| Islands underutilized | LOW | DD-003 | Could add internal density rhythm |

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Before OD-001)

1. **DD-001 Traffic-Light Fix** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Edit lines 468-484 to add 48px separation between Tip and Gotcha callouts
   - OR reorder so they're not adjacent
   - Estimated: 5 min edit

2. **Document Traffic-Light Lesson** (MEDIUM)
   - Add to DISCOVERIES-LOG.md
   - Confirm in DESIGN-SYSTEM/anti-patterns/registry.md

### Deferred Actions (Can Do Later)

1. **DD-001 Fractal Enhancement**
   - Apply breathing rhythm within INHALE sections (sub-sections breathe too)
   - Would increase R3-023 from PARTIAL to YES

2. **DD-003 Islands Enhancement**
   - Add internal density rhythm to islands
   - Make archipelago a more explicit pattern

### No Action Needed

- DD-002, DD-004, DD-005, DD-006 are clean
- R3-037 BOOKENDS can be addressed in OD series
- R3-039 (intersection observers) not in scope

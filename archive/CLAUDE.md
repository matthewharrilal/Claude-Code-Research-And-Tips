## Identity

**Completed phases, historical records, and process artifacts.**

Files here have been superseded by synthesis documents or have completed their operational purpose. They are preserved for historical reference, not active consumption.

## Key Files (If You Need Historical Context)

- `knowledge-architecture/core/ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2.md` — 76 inbound refs, identity anchor
- `knowledge-architecture/core/PIPELINE-BACKBONE.md` — master pipeline narrative
- `knowledge-architecture/AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md` — 268 refs, AD convention spec
- `knowledge-architecture/MASTER-AD-EXECUTION-SPEC.md` — AD execution master spec
- `ka-large-files/WORKFLOW-METACOGNITION-ANALYSIS.md` — strategic workflow insights

## What Was Deleted (Not Archived)

The following were deleted entirely (3/3 audit agent consensus):
- 500+ screenshots (~32MB) — reproducible from HTML explorations
- 287 scratchpad files — fully superseded by synthesis documents
- .DS_Store files, empty directories, duplicate files
- Phase-complete working artifacts with >5:1 compression ratio

## Rules

1. These files are for REFERENCE ONLY — not active pipeline consumption
2. Do not move files back to active/ without explicit justification
3. Do not delete from archive without checking inbound references first

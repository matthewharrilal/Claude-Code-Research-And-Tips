# KortAI Design System

A design system and production pipeline for transforming written content into richly designed single-file HTML pages, built by orchestrated Claude agent teams.

**Read these in order:**

1. `ephemeral/doc-enrichment/03-ENTRY-POINT.md` -- Where we are, what to do, file map (5 min)
2. `ephemeral/continuity-docs/HANDOFF.md` -- Deep context, full state, all definitions (15 min)
3. `ephemeral/doc-enrichment/02-tier-methodology.md` -- The tier building plan and rationale (10 min)

**Then ask the user what they want to do.** Do NOT start building or researching without asking first.

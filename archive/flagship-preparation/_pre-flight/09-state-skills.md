### Existing Content Related to Target Enrichments

#### Void Prevention / Spatial Confidence

**PARTIALLY PRESENT.** The file contains multiple references to void prevention through indirect mechanisms but lacks a dedicated void prevention gate:

1. **Phase 4.0 Container Width Guardrails** (lines 890-926): "Container width 940-960px is NON-NEGOTIABLE." Includes the escape hatch for metaphor-driven narrowness. This is THE #1 Phase D failure mode defense.

2. **W-DEADZONE Warning** (lines 1790-1792): "This metaphor risks dead zones. Enforce MAXIMUM breathing zone of 48px between sections. Section transitions must be CHANGING STATE...NOT EMPTY SPACE."

3. **Pacing Prediction Heuristic (Step 4.2B)** (lines 1208-1247): Includes breathing zone model assessment, dramatic moment placement at 60-80% scroll depth, and transition model check (GOOD: state changes vs BAD: labeled connectors/empty space).

4. **Perceptual Risk Assessment (Step 3.5E)** (lines 626-648): Includes "Transition model: Does this metaphor conceptualize transitions as CHANGING STATE or EMPTY SPACE?" as a risk factor.

5. **Perceptual Cost Assessment (Step 3.5F)** (lines 650-696): Includes "Transitions as empty space: Does this mapping conceptualize transitions as vertical gaps rather than state changes? YES = +1 cost."

**MISSING:** No explicit "Void Prevention Gate" section. No void budget calculation. No reference to the Spatial Confidence Gate's 7 binary checks (SC-01 through SC-07). No content-to-void ratio threshold (60:40). No maximum contiguous void threshold (2,160px / 1.5 viewports). No zone-to-content ratio gate.

#### Spatial Confidence

**PARTIALLY PRESENT.** Content width guardrails serve as partial spatial confidence measures:

- Container width 940-960px (Phase 4.0, lines 890-926)
- Content-to-viewport ratio 65-80% (Phase 4.0, lines 826-835)
- CPL 45-80 formula (Phase 4.0, lines 853-888)
- Compression ratio >= 40% (Phase 4.0, line 850)

**MISSING:** The term "spatial confidence" never appears. No reference to SC-01 through SC-07. No void budget calculation. No content distribution >= 70% check. No squint test. No header ratio <= 20% check. No footer reachability check. No minimum content sections >= 5 check. The Spatial Confidence Gate specification (Report 03, 1,110 lines) is entirely external to the SKILL.md.

#### Restraint

**PARTIALLY PRESENT.** Several sections encode restraint-adjacent concepts:

1. **Mechanism count as proxy, not target** (lines 81-97): "Peak richness occurs at maximum content-mechanism fit, not maximum technique count."

2. **Justification requirement** (lines 1040-1048): "For EACH mechanism you deploy: one sentence on WHY. For AT LEAST 3 mechanisms you considered but REJECTED: one sentence on WHY they don't fit."

3. **Tier deployment levels** (lines 138-144): Distinguishes individual (Middle), combination (Ceiling), and multi-pattern (Flagship) deployment.

**MISSING:** No "Restraint Protocol" section. No mechanism density cap per viewport (max 4). No distribution requirement (every third >= 2). No restraint ratio (rejected/deployed >= 1.5). No silence zone concept. No signal-to-silence ratio (0.6-0.8:1). The enrichment specification for A2 (Report 02, ~50 lines) targets mechanism-catalog.md, not SKILL.md, but the skill file also lacks any reference to these concepts.

### Existing Content Related to Target Enrichments

#### Void Detection

**PARTIALLY PRESENT.** Several existing questions address void-adjacent concerns:

1. **PA-09** (line 132): "Is there dead space that serves no purpose?" -- Catches viewport-scale dead zones.

2. **PA-31** (line 136): "If you covered the content and only looked at the surrounding space, would that space feel designed or leftover?" -- Content-to-viewport proportion, negative space quality.

3. **PA-33** (line 138): "Pick the largest area of empty space. Does it feel like silence in music (purposeful, tension-building) or a dropped signal (accidental, momentum-killing)?" -- Negative space quality.

4. **PA-35** (line 147): "Scroll through the entire page at reading speed. Does your interest stay level, peak and valley, or fade? Where do you start skimming?" -- Scroll momentum and engagement decay.

5. **PA-47** (line 269): "At what scroll position do you start to feel like you've 'seen this before'? Is there anything in the second half of the page that surprises you visually?" -- Visual novelty decay.

6. **Dead Zone Traps** (lines 505-508): Documents dead zones as metaphor failure mode with 24px max breathing zone margins.

7. **Macro whitespace allocation** guardrail (line 343): "30% minimum, 35-45% optimal, 60% max" of layout.

**MISSING:** No PA-49 void detection question. The adversarial pre-mortem (Report 09) explicitly references PA-49: "Is there any point where you can scroll through an entire viewport height without seeing substantial content?" This question does NOT appear in the current SKILL.md. The question number (PA-49) implies it would extend the existing 48-question set by one.

Also MISSING: PA-50 for density overcorrection ("Is there any point where you can scroll through an entire viewport height without a VISUAL BREAK?"). Report 09 explicitly notes "This question does not exist in any preparation document" and flags it as a risk.

#### Spatial Safeguards

**PARTIALLY PRESENT.** The quantitative guardrails section (lines 294-367) provides measurement floors:

- Content container width 640-960px (line 302)
- CPL 45-80 (line 303)
- Content-to-viewport ratio 44-89% (line 304)
- Section vertical spacing 48-160px (line 326)
- Macro whitespace allocation 30-60% (line 343)

**MISSING:** No tier-specific spatial safeguards for Ceiling+ pages. No reference to the Spatial Confidence Gate or its 7 checks. No void budget threshold. No maximum contiguous void measurement. The quantitative guardrails cover individual element measurements but NOT page-scale spatial proportion analysis (which the SC gate provides).

#### Restraint

**NOT DIRECTLY RELEVANT.** The perceptual-auditing skill is about EVALUATING output, not about RESTRAINING mechanism deployment. Restraint is a builder concern, not an auditor concern. However, the adversarial pre-mortem (Report 09, FM-6) does propose a Mode 4 question for evaluating restraint perceptually: "Is there a section where the page is intentionally QUIET -- where the design pulls back to let the content stand alone? Can you identify at least one 'silence zone'?" This does NOT currently exist as a PA question.

## 3. BLOCKING ENRICHMENT ASSESSMENT

### Enrichment 1: Void Prevention Gate in Tension-Composition SKILL.md

**Status: ABSENT**

The tension-composition SKILL.md has no void prevention gate. There is:
- W-DEADZONE warning (builder appendix) -- warns about dead zones but is a WARNING not a GATE
- Pacing Prediction Heuristic (Step 4.2B) -- evaluates pacing risk but has no binary pass/fail
- Perceptual Risk/Cost Assessments (Steps 3.5E/3.5F) -- score transition models but don't block

**What's needed (from Report 02 + Report 03):**

The Spatial Confidence Gate specification (Report 03, 1,110 lines) is a STANDALONE specification with complete JavaScript implementation. The question is: should this be integrated into the SKILL.md, or remain as a separate reference document?

**Recommended approach from Report 09 (adversarial pre-mortem):**
> "Enrichments as REFERENCES, not INLINE rules. The 34 enrichment gaps should be applied to the source files (mechanism-catalog.md, prohibitions.md, tokens.css, semantic-rules.md, SKILL.md) BEFORE the experiment, not encoded as additional builder instructions."

**Specific modifications recommended for tension-composition SKILL.md:**

1. **Add void budget calculation to Phase 0D** (after tier classification, before Phase 1). Insert a spatial budget check: predicted content-to-void ratio >= 60:40 for Ceiling+ pages.

2. **Add Spatial Confidence Gate reference after Phase 4.7B** (Landmark Completeness). Create a new "Phase 4.7C: Spatial Confidence Check" that references the 7 SC checks. For Ceiling+, this is MANDATORY. For Middle, SC-01 (container width) only.

3. **Add content-form fit gate in Phase 4** (before mechanism deployment). Reference content density minimums from Report 02 (A3 + D3): zones must have 3+ paragraphs or 2+ components.

4. **Add restraint protocol reference in Phase 4** (mechanism deployment). Reference the mechanism density cap (4 per viewport), distribution requirement (every third >= 2), and restraint ratio (rejected/deployed >= 1.5 for Ceiling+).

### Enrichment 2: Void Detection Question in Perceptual-Auditing SKILL.md

**Status: ABSENT**

No PA-49 exists. The current skill has 48 questions (PA-01 through PA-48).

**What's needed (from Reports 08, 09):**

PA-49: "Is there any point where you can scroll through an entire viewport height without seeing substantial content? If yes, where?"

This is a void detection question that explicitly catches the ceiling experiment's failure mode. It would be classified as a Tier 2 Standard question under "Spatial Balance and Proportion" (alongside PA-09, PA-30, PA-31, PA-32, PA-33).

**Also recommended but not BLOCKING (from Report 09):**

PA-50: "Is there any point where you can scroll through an entire viewport height without a VISUAL BREAK (a moment of relative calm between dense sections)?" This catches the overcorrection failure mode (wall of content).

**Insertion point:** After PA-47 (line 269) in the Tier 3: Deep Dive section, or at the end of Tier 2 spatial questions. PA-49 should be Tier 2 (Standard, every audit). PA-50 should be Tier 3 (Deep Dive, standalone only).

### Enrichment 3: Spatial Safeguards for Ceiling+ Tier

**Status: ABSENT (across both files)**

Neither skill file contains Ceiling+-specific spatial safeguards.

**What exists (partial, not tier-specific):**
- Container width 940-960px in tension-composition (Phase 4.0)
- General quantitative guardrails in perceptual-auditing (lines 294-367)
- Step 0D-CEILING Context Box (lines 148-166) mentions container width but not spatial confidence gate

**What's needed (from Reports 02, 03, 07, 09, 18):**

**In tension-composition SKILL.md:**
1. Ceiling+ pages MUST pass void budget pre-check (content-to-void >= 60:40) before Phase 1
2. Ceiling+ pages MUST pass Spatial Confidence Gate (7 SC checks) after Phase 4
3. Ceiling+ pages have zone count ceiling tied to content volume (Report 02, A3)
4. Ceiling+ pages have maximum spacing token of 96px (Report 02, C3)
5. Ceiling+ pages require mechanism distribution (every third >= 2) and cap (4 per viewport)

**In perceptual-auditing SKILL.md:**
1. Ceiling-tier elevation note should expand beyond PA-17/PA-41 to include void detection (PA-49)
2. Mode 4 should include spatial confidence pre-check before PA questions (team-lead runs SC-01 through SC-07)
3. Quantitative guardrails should add maximum contiguous void threshold (1.5 viewport heights)

---

## 4. FLAGSHIP PREPARATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SKILL FILES

### From Report 02 (Enrichment Specifications)

The 7 BLOCKING gaps target design system files (prohibitions.md, mechanism-catalog.md, tokens.css, semantic-rules.md), NOT the skill files directly. However:

- **A2 (Restraint Protocol)** targets mechanism-catalog.md but the tension-composition SKILL.md should REFERENCE it in Phase 4 deployment guidance
- **B1 (Max Whitespace Prohibition)** targets prohibitions.md but the tension-composition SKILL.md should reference it in the Phase 4.0 guardrails

### From Report 03 (Spatial Confidence Gate)

- The 1,110-line specification is a STANDALONE document
- The SKILL.md should reference it (pointer, not inline) as a mandatory gate for Ceiling+ pages after Pass 1

### From Report 09 (Adversarial Pre-Mortem)

- "Enrichments as REFERENCES, not INLINE rules" -- SKILL files should POINT TO enriched design system files, not duplicate their content
- PA-49 void detection question must be added to perceptual-auditing SKILL.md
- FM-6 recommends a perceptual restraint verification question for Mode 4

### From Report 18 (Unified Action Plan)

- E1: 7 BLOCKING gaps addressed in design system files (pre-requisite to flagship)
- E2: Enrichments applied to 4 design system files
- Layer 4 Reference Library lists both SKILL.md files as reference documents for the execution prompt
- No SPECIFIC modifications to SKILL files are listed in the action plan, suggesting the skill files are considered adequate IF the design system files are enriched

## 5. SUMMARY TABLE

| Enrichment | File | Status | What Exists | What's Missing |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Void prevention gate** | tension-composition SKILL.md | **ABSENT** | W-DEADZONE warning, Pacing Prediction, Perceptual Risk/Cost scoring | Void budget calculation, SC gate reference, content-to-void ratio threshold, max contiguous void |
| **2. Void detection question** | perceptual-auditing SKILL.md | **ABSENT** | PA-09 (dead space), PA-33 (empty space quality), PA-35 (engagement decay) | PA-49 ("Can you scroll through entire viewport without content?"), PA-50 (density overcorrection) |
| **3. Spatial safeguards (Ceiling+)** | Both SKILL.md files | **ABSENT** | Container width guardrail, general quantitative floors, Ceiling Context Box | Zone count ceiling, max spacing token 96px, mechanism distribution/cap, void budget pre-check, SC gate integration |

### Blocking Status Assessment

**All 3 are ABSENT, not partially present.** The existing content (warnings, pacing heuristics, dead space questions) addresses void prevention INDIRECTLY but lacks the BINARY GATES and EXPLICIT THRESHOLDS that the flagship preparation research identified as necessary. The existing content represents the pre-ceiling-experiment understanding; the needed enrichments represent the post-ceiling-experiment corrections.

### Recommended Implementation Priority

1. **PA-49 void detection question** -- 5 lines, highest ROI, catches the ceiling experiment's exact failure mode, simple insertion
2. **Spatial Confidence Gate reference in SKILL.md** -- 20-30 lines, adds gate reference + void budget check to Phase 0D and Phase 4
3. **Ceiling+ spatial safeguards** -- 40-60 lines, adds tier-specific zone count, spacing cap, mechanism distribution/cap, restraint protocol reference

### Key Distinction

The flagship preparation reports converge on a design principle: **enrichments go to design system files (prohibitions.md, mechanism-catalog.md, tokens.css, semantic-rules.md); the skill files REFERENCE the enriched files.** The skill files are the PIPELINE (how to build); the design system files are the VOCABULARY (what to build with). The 7 BLOCKING enrichments target vocabulary files. The skill file modifications are REFERENCES to enriched vocabulary, not duplicates of enrichment content.

This means the critical path is:
1. Apply 7 BLOCKING enrichments to 4 design system files (Report 02 insertable text)
2. Add PA-49 to perceptual-auditing SKILL.md (5 lines)
3. Add SC gate reference + void budget check to tension-composition SKILL.md (20-30 lines)
4. Verify that enriched design system files are readable by agents during pipeline execution

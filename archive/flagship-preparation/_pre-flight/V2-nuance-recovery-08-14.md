## FILE 08: 08-metacognitive-checkpoints.md → 03-extraction-gates-risks.md

### Mapping: File 08 corresponds to FILE 2 section in 03-extraction-gates-risks.md (starts at line 157)

### MISSED NUANCES

#### 1. Anti-Performative Principle (L10-23)

The extraction captures the 3 design principles (externalize, concrete failure, consequences) but MISSES the framing paragraph's key insight:

**MISSED:** "Documentation served a psychological function (reassuring the preparation team) without serving a mechanical function (preventing failure)." (L12)
- This is a crucial conceptual distinction -- psychological vs. mechanical function of checkpoints. The extraction captures the principle labels but not this diagnostic frame.

**MISSED:** "A performative checkpoint looks like: 'Ask yourself: is the concept buildable?' The agent writes 'Yes, the concept is buildable because [rationalization].' The checkpoint is passed. The failure occurs anyway." (L14)
- The specific EXAMPLE of a performative checkpoint is missing. This is important because it shows the exact pattern to avoid.

#### 2. CHECK 1.1 Spatial Budget (L37-65)

**MISSED DETAIL:** The specific spacing values that would have been caught: "64px/48px/32px/24px padding, 80px checkpoint margins" (L57).
- These exact numbers from the Ceiling build plan are the empirical evidence. The extraction says "cumulative whitespace" generically.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "~2,180px of whitespace from just three sources" (L57).
- The specific calculated result is missing. This concrete number anchors the rationale.

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED:** The failure consequence lists 3 options (reduce zone count, reduce spacing, add content) but the extraction consolidates this generically.

#### 3. CHECK 1.2 Zone Necessity Test (L69-82)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "Zone SEC-B (Installation) and Zone OPS-B (Mental Models) each existed as separate zones because the metaphor demanded 'rooms within wings,' not because the content required structural separation." (L77)
- These specific zone names and the "rooms within wings" metaphor justification are the empirical evidence. The extraction captures the test structure but not the historical examples.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "The default is merge; the planner must argue for keeping." (L79)
- While the extraction notes "2 NOs = FLAG," it does not explicitly state the DEFAULT IS MERGE burden-of-proof reversal, which is architecturally significant.

#### 4. CHECK 1.3 Prompt Length Gate (L86-98)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "the Middle prompt was in the 100-200 line range and the Ceiling prompt was 5-10x beyond it" (L91)
- The specific comparison (Middle = 100-200 lines, Ceiling = 5-10x = 500-2000 lines) that derives the 200-line threshold is missing.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "If still over 200 lines after compression, reduce the scope of the build (fewer zones, fewer mechanisms, fewer designed moments)." (L96)
- The extraction captures compression rules but misses the ESCALATION: first remove thinking, then remove context, then reduce scope. This is a 3-step degradation ladder.

#### 5. CHECK 1.4 Anti-Ambition Audit (L103-115)

**MISSED NUANCE:** "It introduces the concept of SPATIAL COST per addition, which was entirely absent from the Ceiling preparation." (L112)
- The insight that spatial cost was a MISSING CONCEPT (not just underweighted) is not captured.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "the Ceiling experiment optimized for conceptual richness (4 zones, 14 mechanisms, 5 designed moments, 3 checkpoint types, 7 transitions)" (L112)
- The specific feature count list that constitutes "over-ambition" is absent. These numbers provide the concrete warning signs.

#### 6. CHECK 1.5 Metaphor Distance Test (L119-129)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "the Canal Lock metaphor would have added 'elevation change' and 'water flow,' concepts absent from the original content" (L126-127)
- The Canal Lock example of a GOOD metaphor (high interpretive distance) is missing. The extraction captures the Secure Facility as bad example but not the Canal Lock as good example.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "accept the current metaphor with the explicit acknowledgment that it will require structural (not just labeling) expression to survive without text labels" (L128)
- The distinction between structural vs. labeling expression is captured but the conditional acceptance path (acknowledge + commit to structural expression) is partially lost.

#### 7. CHECK 2.1 Fresh-Eyes Proportion Check (L143-160)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** The extraction does well here.

**MISSED:** "Moving this observation to BEFORE mechanism enrichment saves the cost of enriching a fundamentally broken skeleton." (L160)
- The cost-saving rationale for timing is missing -- this explains WHY the checkpoint is at post-Pass-1 rather than later.

#### 8. CHECK 2.2 Void Detection Scan (L164-193)

**MISSED NUANCE:** "At skeleton stage, the threshold is lower (50% vs. 60% for the final page) because mechanisms will add visual density." (L184)
- The extraction captures the 50% threshold but does not explicitly contrast it with the 60% final threshold or explain WHY it's lower. The reasoning (mechanisms add density) is important for preventing confusion about the different thresholds at different stages.

#### 9. CHECK 2.3 Continuation Bias Interrupt (L197-212)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The key mechanism is the second part: 'Is this preventable NOW or only detectable LATER?'" (L209)
- While the extraction captures the pre-mortem structure, it does not highlight that the NOW-vs-LATER classification is identified as "the key mechanism" -- the most important part.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The Ceiling experiment's whitespace void was preventable at the skeleton stage (reduce zones, reduce spacing) but was only detected after Mode 4 PA (the most expensive detection possible)." (L209)
- This specific cost comparison (cheapest fix point vs. most expensive detection point) is the motivating empirical evidence.

#### 10. CHECK 3.1 Subtraction Test (L227-243)

**MISSED NUANCE:** "The reader would lose compliance with the mechanism mandate" is NOT acceptable -- that is a process reason, not a reader reason." (L240-241)
- The extraction captures the WORSE/SAME/BETTER structure but misses this critical ANTI-PATTERN: process-reason justifications are explicitly banned. This is a key guardrail.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "If 3/3 mechanisms survive the test, the mechanisms are well-chosen. If 2/3 are removed, the builder was adding complexity for its own sake." (L242)
- The diagnostic interpretation of the test results is missing. This turns the test from a simple removal tool into a QUALITY SIGNAL about the builder's judgment.

#### 11. CHECK 3.2 Signal-to-Silence Ratio (L247-268)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "the page's strongest moment (architecture diagram) had the INVERSE ratio (~0.33:1)" (L265)
- The specific ratio of the best element is missing. This provides the TARGET ratio for designed moments.

#### 12. CHECK 3.3 Designed Moment Distribution (L272-284)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "the Ceiling page's 5 designed moments clustered at 10-65% scroll depth with zero past 75%" (L277)
- The extraction notes Q4 is most critical and references the ceiling page, but the specific clustering range (10-65%) is missing.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "This is not 'do you have enough designed moments?' (a question the builder will always answer yes). This is 'show me WHERE they are on the scroll axis' (a factual question with a verifiable answer)." (L284)
- The meta-reasoning about WHY the quartile map format prevents performativity is important for understanding the design philosophy.

#### 13. CHECK 3.4 Restraint Inventory (L289-305)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** The extraction covers this well including the genuine-restraint requirement and the escalation to 5 mechanisms.

#### 14. CHECK 4.1 Ego Separation (L319-331)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "PA-2 was the only observer checking spatial experience" (L331)
- The key insight that PA-2 used a DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY (spatial experience vs. content presence) is stated explicitly here. The extraction captures the "4/5 checked presence" framing but not the specific methodological distinction.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The finding is NEVER attributed to 'artifacts' without verification by a third agent." (L329)
- The extraction captures "second independent agent contradicts" but misses the explicit requirement for a THIRD agent for artifact verification. This is a 3-agent chain (finder, challenger, verifier).

#### 15. CHECK 4.2 Level-of-Abstraction Diagnosis (L335-353)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The fix team asked 'what CSS values produce this void?' instead of 'why does this zone have more space than content?'" (L345)
- These two specific QUESTIONS are the diagnostic frame. The extraction captures the classification system but not the contrasting question formulations that explain the misdiagnosis.

**MISSED OPTION:** "Abandon the current build and start from a simpler architecture" (L351)
- The extraction lists restructure, add content, accept defect -- but misses the fourth option: ABANDON. This is significant because it shows the checkpoint includes an escape hatch.

#### 16. CHECK 4.3 Narrative Contamination Test (L357-371)

**MISSED NUANCE:** "the Ceiling verdict was structured as 'SUCCESS WITH CRITICAL DEFECT' -- a narrative frame constructed before evidence was complete, which then served as a filter through which PA-2's legitimate finding was dismissed." (L367)
- The extraction captures narrative contamination generically but misses the specific historical example showing HOW the narrative frame functioned as a filter.

**MISSED:** "This is the ONE purely reflective checkpoint. Its value comes from the act of articulation, not from a pass/fail gate." (L370)
- The meta-statement about this being the ONLY checkpoint without binary enforcement is missing.

#### 17. CHECK 5.1 Dissent Protection Protocol (L386-397)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "'PA-2 probably had Playwright issues' is NOT sufficient. 'A separate agent scrolled the page and confirmed content renders correctly at all scroll positions' IS sufficient." (L396-397)
- The specific example of INSUFFICIENT vs. SUFFICIENT verification language is missing. These are the exemplar templates for the protocol.

#### 18. CHECK 5.2 Success-Axis Alignment (L401-417)

**MISSED DETAIL:** The full example matrix (L405-413) includes 7 dimensions with specific scores and shippability assessments. The extraction captures the structure but not the complete exemplar data.
- Specifically, "Inter-agent msgs | NO (0) | NO (process metric, not product metric)" (L413) is a key classification: inter-agent messaging is explicitly labeled as a PROCESS metric, not product metric. This settles a debate from earlier research.

**MISSED:** "The verdict narrative must be structured as 'EVALUATION' not 'SUCCESS/FAILURE' -- findings first, then assessment." (L417)
- The required narrative structure (EVALUATION framing, findings-first ordering) is missing from the extraction.

#### 19. CHECK 5.3 Framework-Boundary Scan (L422-437)

**MISSED:** The complete example output (L432-434) showing 3 specific framework boundaries:
- "programmatic audit captures binary rule compliance but is blind to proportion (framework boundary: presence vs. perception)"
- "PA captures perceptual quality but is blind to CSS-level correctness (framework boundary: perception vs. specification)"
- "At the boundary between these two frameworks sits 'emergent spatial experience'"
These concrete examples are important for making the abstract concept operational.

#### 20. Implementation Section (L454-503)

**MISSED:** The full enforcement mechanism table (L460-481) showing which checkpoints use which enforcement type (Self-Check / External Agent / Team Lead Verification / Programmatic). While individual checkpoint enforcement is captured in the per-checkpoint extraction, the SUMMARY TABLE that shows the distribution is missing.

**MISSED:** "12 self-checks, 4 external agent checks, 13 team lead verifications, 4 programmatic checks" (L482) -- the aggregate count.

**MISSED:** Three structural safeguards detailed explanation (L486-492):
1. ARTIFACT REQUIREMENT -- "14 of 19 checkpoints require the agent to PRODUCE SOMETHING"
2. TEAM LEAD AS ENFORCER, NOT EVALUATOR -- role distinction
3. EXTERNAL AGENTS AT GESTALT BOUNDARIES -- "self-assessment systematically fails at the gestalt level"

These are the meta-principles for implementation, not captured in the per-checkpoint extraction.

**MISSED:** Three behavior-change mechanisms (L497-502):
1. GATES (6 checkpoints) -- "make continuation impossible"
2. REMOVAL PRESSURE (4 checkpoints) -- "counterbalance complexity bias"
3. NARRATIVE DISRUPTION (4 checkpoints) -- "disrupt verdict narrative"

#### 21. Cost-Benefit Analysis (L506-513)

**MISSED:** "~2 external agent invocations" total cost vs. "~38+ agent invocations" failure cascade cost (L508-510). The specific ROI calculation.

**MISSED:** "A 5-minute spatial budget calculation (Check 1.1) would have prevented the entire Ceiling experiment's failure cascade. The 504px of structural padding was calculable from the build plan's own numbers." (L512-513)
- The "504px" figure is a specific, previously uncited number. Also "5-minute" time estimate for the check.

#### 22. Meta-Metacognitive Check (L534-545)

**MISSED:** "No single agent faces more than 7 checkpoints. This is within the demonstrated attention budget." (L538)
- The maximum per-agent checkpoint count (7) and the assertion that this is within attention budget. This is important for feasibility assessment.

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED (as P-04):** The irreducible minimum of 3 checkpoints is captured but the REASONING for each being load-bearing is partially truncated.

### SUMMARY for File 08
- **Total missed nuances:** 35+ distinct items
- **Most significant misses:** Historical examples with specific numbers, meta-reasoning about WHY designs work, implementation architecture details, cost-benefit quantification
- **Pattern:** The extraction excels at capturing WHAT each checkpoint does and its threshold, but systematically loses WHY it was designed that way and WHAT SPECIFIC HISTORICAL EVIDENCE motivated it

## FILE 09: 09-adversarial-premortem.md → 03-extraction-gates-risks.md (FILE 3, L302+)

### MISSED NUANCES

#### 1. FM-1: Spatial Confidence Gate (L16-27)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "A section with two short paragraphs passes SC-06 ('at least one block of text or interactive content') but perceptually reads as a void with a text label floating in it." (L20)
- The specific SC-06 reference and the vivid description of the perceptual failure mode are missing. The extraction captures the general issue but not this concrete example.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "the squint test evaluates mass distribution at 25% zoom, where even sparse text appears as balanced gray blocks. Two paragraphs at 25% zoom look identical to ten paragraphs." (L22)
- The specific zoom level (25%) and the resolution limitation explanation are missing. This is the technical reason WHY the squint test fails.

#### 2. FM-2: Pass 2 Broke Pass 1 (L30-40)

**MISSED DETAIL:** Specific mechanisms that introduce spacing: "mechanism #1 (border-weight gradient) added border declarations that created visual gaps. Mechanism #7 (zone background differentiation) added padding to create visual breathing room around zone shifts. Mechanism #5 (dense/sparse alternation) added explicit spacing variation." (L32)
- The three specific mechanism examples (by number and name) with their spacing effects are missing. These are concrete case studies of how elaboration adds whitespace.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The cumulative effect was 400-600px of NEW whitespace that did not exist in the Pass 1 skeleton." (L32)
- The specific pixel estimate (400-600px) is missing from the extraction.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "the team-lead's quick-check is a judgment call, and judgment calls achieve ~0% agent compliance per the project's own research" (L36)
- While the extraction captures the general concern about the squint test, this specific self-referential application of the project's own finding (judgment = 0% compliance) to the PA-05c quick-check is an important rhetorical link.

#### 3. FM-3: Metaphor Spatial Obligations (L44-54)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "the metaphor's zone structure inherently requires ~8-12% of page height for inter-zone transitions alone. With 4+ zones, this reaches 15-20% -- at the boundary of the void budget's 15% cap." (L46)
- The specific percentages (8-12% for transitions, 15-20% for 4+ zones, vs. 15% void budget cap) are missing. These numbers show the MATHEMATICAL conflict between metaphor and void budget.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "The planner discovers the spatial conflict only when converting the metaphor into a build plan, at which point the metaphor derivation investment creates sunk cost pressure to proceed rather than re-derive." (L48)
- The sunk cost dynamic (investment in metaphor derivation creates pressure to keep a spatially incompatible metaphor) is not captured. This is a process dynamics insight.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "a cost of 60-80 minutes of wasted build time plus 20-40 minutes of fix cycles" (L50)
- The specific time cost of late detection is missing.

#### 4. FM-4: Messaging as Noise (L58-68)

**MISSED DETAIL:** The specific fake message example: "The skeleton-builder's mandatory check-in said: 'I understand the plan. My biggest spatial concern is header-to-content ratio.' The planner's response was: 'Acknowledged, proceed.'" (L60)
- This CONCRETE EXAMPLE of performative messaging is important for illustrating the failure pattern.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The builder had no genuine question (the plan was detailed enough), so the builder asked a superficial question to satisfy the gate." (L62)
- The insight that DETAILED PLANS create the paradox: better plans = less genuine questions = more performative messaging.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "This is a textbook example of Goodhart's Law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." (L62)
- The Goodhart's Law classification is an important theoretical frame, missing from the extraction.

#### 5. FM-5: Intentionality Layer Cosmetic (L72-83)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The bookending was an echo of the title in the footer. The cognitive transitions were bridge sentences between sections. The self-referential element was a meta-comment in a callout." (L74)
- The SPECIFIC EXAMPLES of what cosmetic intentionality looks like are missing.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "This agent cannot restructure the page -- it can only add content." (L76)
- The architectural constraint that Pass 3 agent RECEIVES a completed page and CAN ONLY ADD is not captured. This is the structural root cause: the 3-pass model makes intentionality additive by definition.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "this percentage was measured on pages where intentionality was DESIGNED IN from the start, not bolted on at the end" (L78)
- The distinction between designed-in vs. bolted-on intentionality, and that the 15-20% quality contribution was measured on designed-in examples, is important context.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "CD-006 scored 39/40 with intentionality designed in from the beginning. The flagship's modular approach to intentionality has never been tested and has structural reasons to fail." (L82)
- The specific CD-006 comparison (39/40, designed-in) and the "never been tested" caveat are missing.

#### 6. FM-6: Restraint Protocol Failure (L86-98)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "14 mechanisms deployed, 21 considered-and-rejected, 2 silence zones documented. The Composition Verification Gate verified these numbers and passed." (L88)
- The specific numbers in the hypothetical scenario are missing.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "14 mechanisms all deploy in the same CSS channels (border + spacing + background), creating perceptual uniformity" (L90)
- The insight that restraint count is different from channel diversity -- many mechanisms in the same channels = perceptual monotony despite numerical restraint. This is a subtle but important distinction.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "A silence zone between Section 3 and Section 4 (documented as 'NO mechanism deploys here') may be a 48px margin with a subtle background shift. The reader scrolling through does not perceive 'designed silence' -- they perceive 'a gap.'" (L92)
- The specific example of how a documented silence zone fails perceptually (48px margin = gap not silence) is important.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "Designed silence requires CONTRAST with surrounding signal, not just absence of mechanism deployment." (L92)
- This definitional claim about designed silence is a key principle: silence ≠ absence; silence = contrast.

**MISSED:** "Silence after silence is void, not restraint." (L94)
- This pithy formulation is a key design principle, not captured.

#### 7. FM-7: Time Overrun (L102-112)

**MISSED DETAIL:** The specific hypothetical timeline: "Pass 1 took 70 minutes... Pass 2 took 65 minutes. The fix cycle after Gate 4 consumed another 25 minutes. By the time Pass 3 was ready to start, the clock was at 195 minutes." (L104)
- This concrete timeline walkthrough is missing.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "the architecture's probability estimate (70-75% success including fix cycles) does not account for time overrun as a failure mode" (L112)
- The specific probability estimate (70-75%) and the gap in the analysis (time overrun not included in failure probability) are missing.

#### 8. FM-8: Novelty vs Quality (L116-127)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "cluttered (too many mechanism deployments in the first half) and desolate (too few in the second half)" (L118)
- The specific perceptual descriptions of the predicted failure (cluttered first half, desolate second half) are missing.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "This delayed the difficult conversation about PA-05c failure by creating a competing narrative of success." (L120)
- The MECHANISM by which novelty contaminates the verdict (creating a competing success narrative that delays acknowledgment of failure) is not captured.

**MISSED:** "cognitive biases operate at the human level, not the structural level, and the narrative gravitates toward the positive finding" (L126)
- The insight that structural safeguards (blocking vs. target criteria) cannot prevent cognitive biases in practice.

#### 9. FM-9: Announced Not Structural (L130-141)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** The extraction does well here, capturing the 55-65% ceiling and the atmospheric target.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "From 40% to 55-60% is achievable; from 40% to 80%+ (structural) is not achievable under current soul constraints." (L134)
- The specific numeric range showing what IS achievable vs. what ISN'T.

**MISSED:** "To achieve 'structural' (>80%), the page would need gradients, shadows, or cool tones -- all prohibited by the soul." (L136)
- The explicit listing of what would be needed (and is prohibited) for structural metaphor expression.

#### 10. FM-10: Seam Visibility (L144-155)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The skeleton-builder writes clean, minimal HTML. The elaboration-builder adds more verbose CSS with metaphor vocabulary. The intentionality-builder (Opus) writes a different prose style for bridge text and meta-annotations." (L148)
- The specific stylistic descriptions of each agent's voice are missing.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "The CSS was coherent; the HTML was not." (L150)
- The distinction between CSS coherence (tokens ensure this) and HTML/prose coherence (nothing ensures this) is important.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "a VOICE GUIDE that specifies prose style, HTML structural patterns, and content conventions from Pass 1. This is equivalent to the 'continuation' principle in fiction editing" (L152)
- The fiction editing analogy is missing. More importantly, the scope of the voice guide (prose style + HTML structural patterns + content conventions) is broader than what the extraction captures.

#### 11. Section 2: Preparation Paradox (L158-236)

**MISSED DETAIL:** Complete rule count breakdown (L164-191):
- 7 Spatial Confidence checks
- 16 Restraint Protocol requirements
- 24 Success Criteria
- 6 Kill Criteria
- 5 Gate requirements
- Mandatory messaging protocol
- 10 BLOCKING enrichments + 14 Important + 10 Nice-to-have
- 10 new gates + 7 cross-cutting changes
- 12 prevention checklist + 5 gates + 7 guardrails
- 7 metacognitive checkpoints + 5 kill criteria + 6 recommendations
- The extraction captures the "150+" total but not the detailed breakdown by source document. This breakdown is important for identifying where rules ACCUMULATE from.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "At 100 rules, each gets 1%. At 150 rules, each gets 0.67%. The MOST IMPORTANT rule (container width = 960px) gets the same fraction as the LEAST IMPORTANT rule (transition timing tokens)." (L202)
- The specific attention-per-rule calculations and the dramatic comparison (960px width = transition timing tokens in attention weight) are missing.

**MISSED NUANCE:** The three-phase constraint density flip (L206-213):
1. "The builder cannot hold all rules in working context simultaneously" (~50-80 rules)
2. "Binary rules start competing with each other" (20+ binary rules → "satisfy checklist" strategy)
3. "Judgment rules are effectively invisible" (100+ total → judgment rules get zero attention)
- While the extraction mentions the constraint flip, it doesn't capture the 3-PHASE model or the specific mechanism of phase 2 (binary rules competing = checklist compliance = "corporate brand compliance failure: every checkbox is ticked, but the result lacks life").

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The flagship is 2-3x beyond the ceiling." (L214)
- The specific multiplier.

#### 12. Section 3: Wall of Content Prediction (L240-287)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** The extraction does well at capturing the mirror-failure prediction.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "6 preparation documents totaling ~3,500 lines" and the enumeration of void-prevention measures: "10 void-related gates and checks, 3 content density minimums, 2 new prohibitions about whitespace, void detection protocol (PA-49), spatial confidence gate with 7 checks, void budget calculations at 3 pipeline stages" (L249-254)
- The specific count of void-prevention apparatus (10+3+2+1+7+3 = 26 measures) is missing.

**MISSED DETAIL:** The overcorrection evidence: "the fix reduced it by 44%. The re-audit found it 'EXCELLENT.' But the fix OVER-reduced it: the new header padding (40px top, 32px bottom) was below the plan's intended 'facility sign' weight." (L272)
- The specific header fix case study with numbers (44% reduction, 40px/32px padding) is missing.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "the ceiling had 91% content ratio by element count" (L274)
- The specific percentage showing that the ceiling's void was NOT caused by insufficient content is missing.

**MISSED:** "What 9/9 auditors will flag" quote (L280-281): "The page is DENSE. Every section is packed. There is no visual rest. My eyes have no place to settle..."
- The predicted auditor response is not captured.

#### 13. Section 4: N=1 Problem (L290-332)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED as R-06 and related items.**

**MISSED NUANCE:** The distinction between 5 content-specific artifacts and 5 robust findings (L301-321) is captured but the SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS for why each is content-specific or robust are missing:
- "4 zones was too many" is content-specific because "Different content with 8 natural sections would support 4 zones easily" (L303)
- "Zero inter-agent messaging correlates with quality defects" is robust because "Confirmed across Middle (missing footer), Ceiling (undetected void during build), and Phase D (various)" (L315)

**MISSED:** "The appropriate confidence level is 'strong hypothesis, weak evidence.'" (L331)
- This specific calibration statement is important for setting expectations.

#### 14. Appendix: Preparation as Performance (L452-471)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED as R-07.**

**MISSED DETAIL:** The specific line counts: "6 preparation documents totaling ~3,500 lines, 1 adversarial anti-scale document of 430 lines, 1 verdict document of 851 lines, This pre-mortem adding another ~700 lines, Total: ~5,500 lines" (L457-461)
- The detailed breakdown of preparation corpus is missing.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The meta-to-output ratio from the Middle experiment retrospective was 2.6:1 (47,944 lines infrastructure vs 18,428 lines product)." (L463)
- The specific numbers from the Middle experiment for comparison.

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The builder will receive a 200-line prompt that captures perhaps 4% of the preparation corpus. 96% of the preparation will never influence the build." (L467)
- The specific percentage (4% captured, 96% lost).

**MISSED:** "the preparation itself introduces NEW failure modes (prompt overload, overcorrection, attention fragmentation) that the preparation cannot address because the preparation is the cause" (L471)
- This recursive insight (preparation creates failure modes it cannot address) is the deepest observation in the document.

**MISSED:** "The most dangerous document in the preparation corpus is the one that makes us feel most safe." (L473)
- This closing epigram is missing.

### SUMMARY for File 09
- **Total missed nuances:** 40+ distinct items
- **Most significant misses:** Specific numerical evidence (pixel counts, percentages, time estimates), concrete examples of failure patterns, Goodhart's Law framing, the 3-phase constraint density flip model, the preparation-as-cause-of-failure recursive insight
- **Pattern:** Same as file 08 -- the extraction captures the STRUCTURE (failure modes + countermeasures) excellently but loses the EVIDENCE (specific numbers, examples, comparisons) and THEORY (why things fail, recursive dynamics)

---

## FILE 10: 10-prompt-architecture.md → 04-extraction-prompt-aesthetics.md (FILE 1, L12+)

### OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The extraction for file 10 is EXCELLENT. It captures the 4-layer architecture, all 56 rule classifications, the 25 critical rules, the 3 new spatial rules, all cross-references, and the key forensic findings. This is the most thorough extraction of the set.

### MISSED NUANCES

#### 1. Binary Compliance Table (L24-44)

**MISSED:** The complete compliance table showing ALL 18 binary rules that achieved 100%. The extraction notes "18/18 = 100%" but does not reproduce the specific rule-by-line-number-by-outcome table. Key details:
- "h3 italic" at line 523: "PASS (but re-audit found italic missing on some)" (L33) -- the parenthetical qualification is important; this was a near-miss.
- "Per-category minimums S:1+,H:1+,C:1+,D:1+,N:1+" at line 348: "ALL 5 categories covered (14 mechanisms)" (L34) -- confirms the per-category mandate worked.

#### 2. Builder Effective Context (L47-74)

**MISSED:** The detailed breakdown showing WHAT PERCENTAGE of the prompt each role consumed:
- Builder: 10-15%
- Metaphor-agent: 15-20%
- Planner: 25-30%
- Auditors: 10%
- Team-lead: 80%
- These percentages demonstrate the "prompt is mostly for the team-lead" finding concretely.

**MISSED:** The specific line-count breakdown per section (L60-72): "~237 lines were team topology + task creation (Section 2) -- consumed by team-lead only" etc. This shows WHERE the bloat lives.

#### 3. Deletable Sections (L76-90)

**CAPTURED as A14** but the extraction compresses the nuanced assessment. For example:
**MISSED:** "Section 3.4: Anti-spam table -- no messages were sent anyway -- Sending too many messages was NEVER a risk" (L82) -- the irony that anti-spam was specified when the problem was zero messages.

#### 4. Container Width Analysis (L106-112)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "The builder's CSS included `max-width: 960px; margin: 0 auto;` -- the exact specification from the prompt (lines 411-416). The 2160px measurement was almost certainly measuring the viewport or a parent container, not the content container." (L110)
- The forensic finding that the builder DID comply and the measurement was wrong is important context.

#### 5. Why Zero Messages (L114-122)

**MISSED NUANCE:** "the BEHAVIORAL TRIGGER was missing -- nothing in the builder's instructions said 'send at least one message.'" (L118)
- While the CAN→MUST conversion is captured (A07), the specific term "behavioral trigger" and the gap between Section 8.1 criteria and builder instructions is a useful concept.

**MISSED NUANCE:** "the builder's role was implementation, not questioning. The Middle experiment's missing footer was caught because the ABSENCE was obvious. The Ceiling plan's spatial blindness was not obvious -- it was an unvalidated assumption embedded in correct-looking specifications." (L120)
- The distinction between OBVIOUS absences (footer) and HIDDEN assumptions (spatial proportion) is important for understanding when messaging fails.

#### 6. Whitespace Void Root Cause (L124-135)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "7 zones x ~45px avg padding x 2 = ~630px. 5 checkpoints x ~110px avg = ~550px. 25 headings x ~40px avg top margin = ~1,000px. That is ~2,180px of whitespace from structural elements alone" (L133)
- The specific arithmetic showing the whitespace source breakdown. The extraction captures "spatial accountability" generically but not this specific calculation.

**MISSED:** "The content occupied ~3,600px. Total whitespace-to-content ratio was predetermined at the BUILD PLAN level." (L133)
- The key insight that the ratio was PREDETERMINED -- not caused by the builder.

**MISSED:** "The void was not a CSS bug. It was an ARCHITECTURAL decision baked into the metaphor (4 zones requiring graduated density) interacting with limited content volume (1,184 words)." (L135)
- The word count (1,184 words) is a specific number not captured elsewhere.

#### 7. Compliance-Complexity Correlation Table (L137-148)

**MISSED:** The 6-row table showing correlation between rule type/complexity and compliance:
- Simple binary: 100%
- Binary with formula: 100% (boundary)
- Binary with process: 100%
- Capability rule: 0%
- Judgment rule: ~40%
- Multi-step judgment: 0%

The pattern "compliance = 1/complexity" (L148) and the near-perfect correlation are not in the extraction.

#### 8. Option Evaluation (L154-202)

**MISSED:** The evaluation of Options A, B, C showing WHY they were rejected:
- Option A (single short prompt): "Middle experiment was effectively this option and it achieved 'professionally stiff.' Flagship needs more." (L170)
- Option B (layered prompts): "does not address the creative conditions (conviction, designed moments, purpose-built components)" (L186)
- Option C (role-specific): "QUALITY is not a property of any single agent's prompt -- it emerges from the INTERACTION between agents" (L202)

These rejection rationales are important for understanding why the two-layer architecture was chosen.

#### 9. Section 4: The Critical 2.5% (L247-307)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED as A16.** The 25 critical rules are listed but:

**MISSED NUANCE:** "The builder needs 25-30 lines of critical rules + 20-30 lines of spatial gates = ~55 lines of execution spec. Everything else is context that the HUMAN needs to understand the system but the AGENT does not need to internalize." (L307)
- The human/agent distinction in audience is a key architectural principle.

#### 10. Finding 2 (L546-555)

**MISSED:** "The prompt solved the LAST experiment's problem, not the NEXT one" (L547)
- The specific list of Middle defects corrected successfully vs. the emergent failure not anticipated. This pattern (solving the previous war) is important.

**MISSED DETAIL:** The specific corrections list: "Missing footer -> CP-4 landmark gate (SUCCESS: footer was present), Token compliance 66.5% -> self-check with formula (SUCCESS: 86%), CPL +2 -> formula in builder self-check (SUCCESS: 80.0 at boundary), Metronomic rhythm -> 3-transition MANDATORY (SUCCESS: 3 types used), Zero messaging -> communication protocol (FAILURE: still zero messages)" (L549-553)

#### 11. Finding 5: Redundancy (L569-573)

**MISSED DETAIL:** "Container width appears at lines 410, 416, and 432 (3 times). Per-category minimums at lines 348 and 727 (2 times). Token compliance at lines 396, 432, and 550 (3 times)." (L571)
- The specific line numbers and repetition counts that prove redundancy.

**MISSED:** "Redundancy does not reinforce; it dilutes." (L573)
- This principle is captured generically but the pithy formulation is lost.

### SUMMARY for File 10
- **Total missed nuances:** 20+ items
- **Assessment:** The extraction is the BEST of all three sets. Most misses are empirical details (specific numbers, line references) and rejection rationales for alternatives. The extraction captures the architecture and recommendations correctly.

---

## FILE 11: 11-crown-jewel-forensics.md → 04-extraction-prompt-aesthetics.md (FILE 2, L269+)

### OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The extraction does well at capturing the "MUST Replicate" items, the 8-check quality gate, and the target metrics. However, it misses substantial forensic detail from the CSS technique inventory and the "magic" analysis.

### MISSED NUANCES

#### 1. CSS Stats Comparison (L16-27)

**MISSED:** The specific CSS statistics that anchor the forensic analysis:
- DD-006: 600 CSS lines, ~250 active declarations, 42 classes, 26 tokens, 3 media queries
- CD-006: 1,035 CSS lines, ~550 active declarations, 95+ classes, 54 tokens, 4-5 media queries
- These numbers establish the quantitative baseline for the flagship targets.

#### 2. Layout Property Inventory (L32-43)

**MISSED:** Several specific technique details:
- `display: grid` usage difference: "2 uses" in DD-006 vs "6 uses" in CD-006 (L35)
- Specific grid patterns: "1fr 1fr 1fr", "repeat(4,1fr)" vs "1.618fr 1fr", "repeat(3,1fr)" (L36)
- CD-006's `float: left` used ONLY for drop cap (L42) -- important scope limitation

#### 3. Typography Details (L46-58)

**MISSED:** "CD-006 uses 600 heavily for labels" (L52) -- the specific weight convention.
**MISSED:** "max-width: 65ch/70ch" paragraph measure constraint (L56) -- different values between crown jewels.
**MISSED:** "`-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` in CD-006 body" (L57) -- subtle rendering detail.

#### 4. Color/Background Details (L61-70)

**MISSED:** "DD-006 uses `rgba(232, 48, 37, 0.03/0.06/0.09)` for progressive opacity in nested fractals" (L70)
- The SPECIFIC rgba values for the progressive tinting technique. The extraction mentions "progressive rgba opacity" but not the exact values.

#### 5. Border System (L72-89)

**MISSED DETAIL:** DD-006 uses `border-left: 2px` once (L77) -- this contradicts the "NEVER 2px" rule. DD-006 is pre-dating the rule, making it a system evolution marker.
**MISSED:** CD-006's `border: 3px solid` is used 12 times (L81) as the PRIMARY structural border -- a quantitative detail.

#### 6. Subtlety Inventory (L233-261)

**MISSED (ENTIRE SECTION):** The 15 CD-006 subtleties and 7 DD-006 subtleties are almost entirely absent from the extraction. These are the "invisible-but-present" techniques that separate crown jewels from competent pages. Key examples:
- "`overflow-wrap: break-word` on paragraphs" (L249) -- prevents layout breaks
- "`flex-shrink: 0` on task checkboxes" (L252) -- prevents squishing
- "`margin-top: 4px` on task checkboxes" (L253) -- 4px micro-alignment
- "`line-height: 0.8` on drop cap" (L257) -- prevents content displacement
- "`display: flex; align-items: baseline; gap: var(--space-2)`" on TOC links (L260) -- THREE fonts on the same baseline
- "`reasoning-column li::before { content: "--" }`" (L261) -- double-dash instead of bullet

These micro-details are what make the difference between a competent page and a crown jewel. They are NOT in the extraction.

#### 7. 99th Percentile Details (L263-271)

**MISSED:** The 6 "99th percentile" details are absent:
- CD-006's `<style id="locked-layer">` (L265) -- inspectable style element
- CD-006 section comments cite research finding IDs (L266)
- TOC entries show axis pattern names (L267) -- partially captured
- Section-meta labels show triple descriptor (L268) -- partially captured
- DD-006's 116 lines of provenance metadata BEFORE `<!DOCTYPE html>` (L269)
- CD-006's findings embedded in closing HTML comments (L270)

#### 8. DD-006 Mechanism Inventory (L156-181)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED.** The extraction focuses on CD-006's techniques but misses several DD-006 specifics:
- "Fractal connector character `≈`" (L239) -- using mathematical symbols semantically
- "`█░░█░░█░░` ASCII density patterns" (L241) -- micro-teaching tools
- The specific list of mechanisms ABSENT from DD-006 (L171-181) is important for understanding what CD-006 added.

#### 9. CD-006 Section-by-Section Mechanism Density (L211-222)

**MISSED:** The complete section-by-section table showing axis, density, organization, components used, and transition type for all 8 sections. This is the most granular deployment map and is important for understanding how variety was achieved.

#### 10. "Magic" Analysis (L352-402)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED via X12.** The 5 principles are listed but the supporting analysis is missing:

**MISSED:** DD-006's magic described as "CONCEPTUAL RECURSION" -- "The page IS its own argument" (L356). The extraction captures "BE THE ARGUMENT" but not the deeper analysis.

**MISSED:** DD-006's three principles: (1) Be the argument, (2) Label for confirmation not instruction, (3) Progressive deepening not progressive complexity (L361-363). Principle 2 ("the pattern should be perceptible BEFORE the label makes it conscious") and 3 ("Nothing new is introduced -- only depth") are architecturally important.

**MISSED:** CD-006's 5-point magic analysis: (1) TOC telegraphs variety, (2) transitions carry semantic weight, (3) bookend architecture, (4) 4-act density arc, (5) component-content fit is 100%. The extraction captures these as individual techniques but misses the integrative analysis.

**MISSED:** "ZERO components feel forced. This is the most important quality signal: content DEMANDED the structure." (L377)
- This is arguably the single most important finding in the entire file.

#### 11. "Where the Magic Lives" Distribution (L392-402)

**MISSED:** The CSS/HTML/Content distribution table:
- DD-006: 30% CSS, 40% HTML structure, 30% content
- CD-006: 40% CSS, 35% HTML structure, 25% content
- "DD-006's magic is more in the HTML structure" vs "CD-006's magic is more in the CSS"
- Both derive ~25-30% from content (meta-documentation)

#### 12. What DD-006 Does Better (L508-518)

**MISSED:** The 5 areas where DD-006 outperforms CD-006:
1. Conceptual purity (ONE idea explored deeply vs. everything explored broadly)
2. rgba() progressive opacity (unique technique)
3. Reduced AVERAGE nesting depth
4. The "Complete Fractal Example" nested-boxes teaching device
5. Visual simplicity (white backgrounds only)

This counterbalances the CD-006-centric extraction and shows that simplicity has its own power.

#### 13. CSS Lines Distribution (L520-536)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED via X13.** The specific distribution is missing:
- DD-006: 40% typography, 30% border/background, 20% layout, 10% accessibility
- CD-006: 25% component, 25% layout, 20% typography, 15% transition/responsive, 10% accessibility, 5% tokens

#### 14. Content-Specific vs. Transferable (L440-452)

**MISSED:** The 6 items classified as "Content-Specific" with explicit notes on what DOES transfer:
- "The TECHNIQUE (progressive rgba opacity) transfers; the CONTENT does not" (L442)
- "The Decision Matrix COMPONENT transfers" (L446)
- "the PRINCIPLE (content-mechanism fit) transfers" (L448)
- "the requirement for cognitive-reframe prose at bridges transfers" (L452)

### SUMMARY for File 11
- **Total missed nuances:** 30+ items
- **Most significant misses:** The entire subtlety inventory (22 micro-techniques), the "magic" analysis with its 3+5 principles, the DD-006 advantages, the CSS distribution data, and the content-specific vs. transferable distinction
- **Pattern:** The extraction captures the PRESCRIPTIVE output (what to replicate, the quality gate) but misses the FORENSIC EVIDENCE (specific CSS values, micro-adjustments, distribution analysis) that supports those prescriptions

---

## FILE 12: 12-defining-beautiful.md → 04-extraction-prompt-aesthetics.md (FILE 3, L578+)

### OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The extraction is GOOD for this file. It captures the 7 beauty prerequisites, the beauty brief, the resolved tensions framework, and the perceptual sequence. The primary misses are in the philosophical framing and the crown jewel beauty analysis.

### MISSED NUANCES

#### 1. Opening Problem Statement (L10-23)

**MISSED:** "We have never asked: Is this beautiful?" (L15) and "This is not an oversight. It is an evasion." (L17)
- The framing that beauty was DELIBERATELY AVOIDED, not overlooked.

**MISSED:** "we routed around it, building increasingly sophisticated proxies -- richness scores, novelty assessments, PA-05 sub-criteria -- hoping that if we measured enough adjacent properties, beauty would emerge as a side effect." (L17)
- The "proxy accumulation" anti-pattern.

**MISSED:** "Two auditors would have put their name on it" (L21) -- about the Middle page. A strong qualitative signal.

#### 2. "What Beauty Is Not" (L25-34)

**MISSED:** The four negation statements with their reasoning:
- "Richness is the vocabulary available; beauty is what you say with it. A sonnet with a 50,000-word vocabulary is not inherently more beautiful than one with a 5,000-word vocabulary." (L27)
- "Novelty is surprise; beauty is the particular quality of surprise that resolves into satisfaction rather than confusion." (L29)
- "The soul constraints prevent ugliness... They do not produce beauty. They clear the ground for it." (L31)
- "Polish is the absence of errors; beauty is the presence of something harder to name." (L33)

These distinctions (vocabulary vs. expression, surprise vs. satisfying surprise, preventing ugliness vs. producing beauty, absence of errors vs. presence of quality) are philosophically important.

#### 3. Beauty Definition Details (L37-47)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED as A41.** But:
**MISSED:** "The antonym of confident is not ugly -- it is tentative." (L43) -- a key reframing.
**MISSED:** "'like someone stopped designing halfway through' (Auditor A)" (L43) -- the specific quote.
**MISSED:** "Templates cannot produce this quality. Only composition can." (L45) -- an important anti-template statement.
**MISSED:** "This is NOT fractal coherence (which is about pattern repetition). This is about the QUALITY OF CARE being consistent across zoom levels." (L47) -- distinguishing beauty from fractal coherence.

#### 4. KortAI-Specific Definition (L49-59)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED as A42.** But:
**MISSED:** "Each pair (warm/not-soft, austere/not-cold, authoritative/not-aggressive, restrained/not-empty) is a tightrope. Beauty is the experience of someone walking all four tightropes simultaneously without falling off any of them." (L55) -- the "tightrope" metaphor.

**MISSED:** The crown jewels analysis: "They are warm (cream backgrounds, editorial serif, generous line height). They are not soft (sharp edges, flat surfaces, angular precision). They are austere (constrained palette, minimal decoration). They are not cold (warm tones, breathing room, human-scale typography)." (L59) -- specific CSS property → resolved tension mapping.

#### 5. Perceptual Sequence (L63-119)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED as A43.** The extraction captures the delight placement percentages. But:

**MISSED:** The 5-second assessment (L65-77):
- "Second 0-1: Arrival" -- "this is serious, this is editorial, this has authority... but this is not hostile" (L69)
- "Second 3-5: Spatial confidence" -- "they are ASSESSING... Is this page worth my time?" (L75)
- "At the end of five seconds, the viewer has a gut verdict" (L77)

**MISSED:** The "Descent with pauses" pattern (L81-93): "Not F-pattern. Not Z-pattern. Descent with pauses." -- explicitly rejecting both common reading patterns. The 8-step descent pattern (land, pause, scan, encounter, pause, resume, encounter rhythm, arrive) is the operational model.

**MISSED:** "This is a narrative arc applied to visual density. It mirrors the structure of a well-composed piece of music: overture, development, recapitulation." (L110) -- the musical analogy.

#### 6. Crown Jewel Beauty Analysis (L123-158)

**MOSTLY MISSED.** The extraction captures the beauty definition but not the crown jewel comparison:

**MISSED:** DD-006: "beauty as revealed structure... the viewer experiences the satisfaction of recognition" (L131)
**MISSED:** DD-006: "three CSS properties doing the work of an entire visual system. That economy is beautiful... the constraints forced the designer to find depth through border weight and background tint alone, and the result is MORE expressive than the conventional toolkit" (L133)
**MISSED:** "DD-006's beauty is the beauty of constraint as generative force." (L135)

**MISSED:** CD-006: "it moves... the reader's experience has VELOCITY" (L140)
**MISSED:** CD-006: "CD-006's beauty is the beauty of compositional confidence -- the sense that someone conducted the page like an orchestra" (L145)

**MISSED:** The comparison table (L151-158):
- DD-006 primary mechanism: Revealed structure (teaching)
- CD-006 primary mechanism: Compositional pacing (conducting)
- "What would destroy it": DD-006 = removing fractal visualization; CD-006 = inserting dead space

**MISSED:** "the flagship builder should not aim for 'beautiful' as a single target but should understand WHICH KIND of beauty their content and metaphor support." (L159) -- beauty is content-dependent, not one-size-fits-all.

#### 7. Beauty Destroyers (L177-199)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED as P06, P07.** But several specific details are missing:

**MISSED:** "The distinction between intentional white space (which contributes to beauty) and void (which destroys it) is whether the space is BOUNDED." (L181) -- the BOUNDED distinction.

**MISSED:** "Texture is not beautiful; it is merely present." (L183) -- pithy summary of monotony's effect.

**MISSED:** "DD-006's 3px primary border on the header is not tentative. CD-006's 3rem drop caps are not tentative. These are declarations." (L185) -- specific examples of committed vs. tentative signals.

**MISSED:** "Proportion is the balance of visual weight across the page." (L187) -- definition of proportion.

**MISSED:** "Every decorative element competes with meaningful elements for the viewer's pattern-recognition bandwidth." (L191) -- bandwidth model of decoration.

#### 8. Most Common Agent Failure (L202-211)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED as A44.** But:
**MISSED:** "Pages that are IMPRESSIVE but not BEAUTIFUL." (L204) -- the IMPRESSIVE/BEAUTIFUL distinction.
**MISSED:** "The result is a page where the viewer thinks 'that is an interesting technique' rather than 'that is a well-designed page.'" (L206) -- the telltale viewer reaction.

#### 9. Beauty Brief Details (L276-303)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED as A39, A46.** But:
**MISSED:** "Not a textbook. Not a coffee-table book. A book where the typographer, the editor, and the bookbinder all cared about the same thing: the reader's experience." (L280) -- the multi-role metaphor.

#### 10. Evidence Map (L323-336)

**MISSED:** The complete evidence map table linking claims to sources and evidence. This is a traceability artifact not captured in the extraction. Key entries:
- "Beauty not decomposable -- requires conviction" linked to "P08 in extraction" but the evidence (auditor quotes, specific scores) is lost.
- "Confidence as core beauty quality" linked to "Middle 'spatially confident' vs Ceiling 'lost in canvas'" (L336)

### SUMMARY for File 12
- **Total missed nuances:** 25+ items
- **Most significant misses:** The philosophical distinctions (vocabulary vs. expression, proxy accumulation, bounded vs. unbounded space), the crown jewel beauty analysis (constraint as generative force, compositional confidence), the 5-second assessment model, the IMPRESSIVE/BEAUTIFUL distinction
- **Pattern:** The extraction captures the PRESCRIPTIVE output (prerequisites, brief, tensions) but loses the PHILOSOPHICAL REASONING and CROWN JEWEL EVIDENCE that makes the prescriptions meaningful

---

## FILE 13: 13-compositional-fluency.md → 05-extraction-composition-intent.md (FILE 13, L13+)

### OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The extraction is VERY GOOD for this file. It captures all 13 action items, 2 prerequisites, 5 binary checks, 4 file modifications, and 11 cross-references. The primary misses are in the rich example code and the theoretical framework sections.

### MISSED NUANCES

#### 1. Core Distinction (L22-26)

**MISSED:** "The page had 12 mechanisms, and you could remove any single one without the page feeling fundamentally different." (L24)
- The extraction captures the vocabulary/composition distinction abstractly but misses this concrete test formulation.

**MISSED:** "Removing border-weight gradient from OD-004 would break the zone backgrounds' semantic encoding, which would undermine the spacing compression's meaning, which would collapse the typographic hierarchy's rationale." (L26)
- The CHAIN of dependencies (a breaks b breaks c breaks d) is missing. This shows what compositional coupling LOOKS LIKE concretely.

#### 2. Three Analogies (L29-34)

**MISSED:** All three analogies (Music: chord overtones, Architecture: materials justifying each other, Language: "the cold rain tightened the already taut membrane of silence"). These are not action items but they are important for COMMUNICATING the concept to builders. The extraction captures the concept but not the teaching tools.

#### 3. Formal Definition (L38-46)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED.** The three testable sub-properties are partially captured:

**MISSED:** "Multi-channel encoding: 2+ mechanisms express the SAME meaning through different CSS properties" (L42) -- the formal name and definition.

**MISSED:** "Emergent properties: The combination produces perceptual effects that no individual mechanism could create alone. The 'atmospheric pressure change' when scrolling from a sparse zone into a dense zone — that feeling is not in the spacing alone, not in the background alone, not in the borders alone. It is in their CONVERGENCE." (L46)
- The "atmospheric pressure change" description is the most vivid explanation of emergence in the document.

#### 4. Concrete CSS Examples (L56-112)

**MISSED:** The complete OD-004 geological confidence CSS example (L58-78) showing three mechanisms encoding "depth" simultaneously. The extraction references "co-varying values" abstractly but the specific CSS showing `.stratum--established` through `.stratum--open` with parallel changes in border-width, background, and padding is the single most important teaching example in the file.

**MISSED:** The Middle-tier CONTRAST example (L91-107) showing mechanisms encoding DIFFERENT semantics independently. The side-by-side comparison (compositional vs. vocabulary) in CSS is the most effective teaching tool.

**MISSED:** "Three mechanisms, three SEPARATE semantic dimensions. They don't talk to each other... like three instruments playing different songs at the same time." (L111)

#### 5. Interaction Types 2-5 (L115-247)

**MISSED (ENTIRE SUBSECTION):** The extraction captures Interaction Type 1 (reinforcing) well but misses:

- **Type 2: MODULATING** (L115-148) -- One mechanism controls another's intensity. The DD-006 example where dense/sparse alternation (#5) REACHES INSIDE components and adjusts their internal 2-zone DNA. "This creates FRACTAL COHERENCE: the same density direction appears at multiple zoom levels" (L148).

- **Type 3: RESPONDING** (L152-183) -- One mechanism's visual weight creates a condition the next responds to. The CD-006 dark header → drop cap example. "In vocabulary fluency, a drop cap is 'a mechanism I deployed because I covered 5 categories.' In compositional fluency, a drop cap is 'the mechanism that answers the header's visual weight.'" (L183)

- **Type 4: CONTRASTING** (L187-209) -- Presence in one zone makes absence in another meaningful. "If ALL zones had backgrounds, none would feel special. If NO zones had backgrounds, there would be no zones at all." (L204-205)

- **Type 5: CASCADING** (L213-247) -- A chain where each mechanism enables the next. "Progressive disclosure (#12) establishes a density trajectory. Zone backgrounds (#7) follow that trajectory... The density arc is the composer; the mechanisms are the instruments." (L244-246)

These 5 interaction types are the FILE'S MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION. The extraction captures the action items but misses the TAXONOMY of interaction that makes composition teachable.

#### 6. Why Agents Struggle (L250-295)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED.** The extraction references messaging but misses the 5-problem analysis:

**MISSED:** Problem 1: "Linear processing fragments [composition] into three independent decisions" (L256) -- the cognitive architecture explanation.

**MISSED:** Problem 2: "In human design, the designer places a dark header, steps back, sees the visual weight, and thinks 'the first section needs something dramatic to answer that weight.' This stepping-back-and-responding is natural for iterative human work but ALIEN to single-pass agent execution." (L264)

**MISSED:** Problem 3: "No instruction says 'if you deploy #13 (dark header), follow it with #16 (drop cap) to manage the weight transition'" (L273) -- the specific example of a missing relationship specification.

**MISSED:** Problem 4: "The 'specifications applied correctly vs composition felt through' distinction from the retrospective has no metric" (L284) -- the measurement gap.

#### 7. Strategy 5: Builder Must See the Metaphor (L381-403)

**CAPTURED as A13-05** but:
**MISSED:** "ALL mechanisms that vary should vary in the SAME DIRECTION at the SAME RATE" (L396) -- the co-variation rule stated as a single line.

**MISSED:** "If you deploy a mechanism that does NOT participate in the depth metaphor, document why it is an EXCEPTION" (L399) -- the exception-documentation requirement.

#### 8. Two-Axis Model (L578-625)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED as A13-13.** But:

**MISSED:** The ASCII diagram showing the 2-axis grid with 4 quadrants (L584-602). This is the most important conceptual framework in the document.

**MISSED:** "The Middle-tier experiment moved along the VOCABULARY axis (5 → 12 mechanisms) without moving along the COMPOSITION axis. That is why it achieved 'DESIGNED' (vocabulary threshold) but not 'felt through' (composition threshold). The move from Middle to Ceiling is not 'more mechanisms' — it is ORTHOGONAL." (L614)

**MISSED:** The reframed tier model table (L618-624): "Flagship has FEWER mechanisms than the ceiling experiment's 14, because the restraint protocol (1.5:1 reject-to-deploy) ensures only load-bearing mechanisms survive." (L625) -- Flagship may have FEWER mechanisms than ceiling, not more.

#### 9. Section VIII: The Deeper Question (L629-648)

**MISSED:** "composition can be SCAFFOLDED but not SPECIFIED" (L633) -- the core conclusion.

**MISSED:** "None of these GUARANTEE composition. But they create the conditions for it to emerge — the same way a music conservatory can teach harmony theory, show examples of great harmonization, and provide exercises in part-writing, without guaranteeing that every student will compose a symphony." (L644) -- the conservatory analogy.

**MISSED:** "The metaphor IS the compositional framework." (L647) -- the key insight that metaphor is not decoration but the mechanism that makes composition possible.

#### 10. Summary Table (L654-664)

**MISSED:** The complete 10-row comparison table between vocabulary and compositional fluency. Key rows:
- "What the reader perceives": "Professionally competent" vs "Atmospheric, immersive"
- "The test": "Can you list the mechanisms?" vs "Can you describe the atmosphere?"
- "Perceptual audit verdict": "Specifications applied correctly" vs "Composition felt through"

### SUMMARY for File 13
- **Total missed nuances:** 30+ items
- **Most significant misses:** The 5 interaction types taxonomy (REINFORCING, MODULATING, RESPONDING, CONTRASTING, CASCADING), the concrete CSS examples showing compositional vs. vocabulary deployment, the 2-axis model with ASCII diagram, the "scaffolded not specified" conclusion, and the 5-problem analysis of why agents struggle
- **Pattern:** The extraction excels at capturing ACTION ITEMS (what to DO) but misses the TEACHING CONTENT (how to understand composition, how to recognize it, why it matters). The file is as much a tutorial as a specification, and the tutorial dimension is largely lost.

## FILE 14: 14-intentionality-layer-design.md → 05-extraction-composition-intent.md (FILE 14, L195+)

### OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The extraction is EXCELLENT for this file. It captures all 13 action items, 5 prerequisites, 16 binary checks, 5 file modifications, 6 cross-references, and 18 danger zones. The danger zones are particularly well-extracted. This is one of the most complete extractions.

### MISSED NUANCES

#### 1. Executive Summary (L16-21)

**MISSED:** "These dimensions constitute 15-20% of crown jewel quality and are the primary differentiator between Ceiling and Flagship tier." (L18)
- The specific quality contribution percentage and tier differentiation role.

**MISSED:** "The ceiling experiment page (`ceiling-page.html`) scores 0/6 on these dimensions. DD-006 scores 4/6. CD-006 scores 6/6." (L20-21)
- The specific scores ARE captured in the cross-references section but not prominently in the action items.

#### 2. Self-Reference Examples (L32-68)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED.** The extraction notes "code block showing CSS of its own container" but misses the specific examples:

**MISSED:** DD-006 lines 930-936: The callout that "DESCRIBES the 2-zone structure while BEING a 2-zone structure." (L45) -- the specific HTML.

**MISSED:** CD-006 line 1109: "This page is both tutorial and proof -- the documentation system documenting itself." (L52-53) -- the subtitle declaration.

**MISSED:** CD-006 lines 1684-1688: "This code example appears INSIDE a callout whose own `border-left` IS `4px solid`. The CSS being taught is the CSS being rendered." (L65) -- the most vivid self-reference example.

**MISSED:** "The ceiling page is about 'Remote Mac Control' — its content and form are entirely unrelated. The metaphor (secure facility) decorates the content but does not demonstrate it." (L68) -- the counter-example analysis.

#### 3. Pedagogical Sequencing (L123-207)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** But:

**MISSED:** DD-006's 4-stage learning progression (L134-137): SHOW→PROVE individually→PROVE in combination→STATE conclusion. This is a concrete example of pedagogical sequencing.

**MISSED:** "Each act transforms the reader's cognitive state: from wondering to knowing to doing to reflecting." (L147) -- the cognitive state progression.

**MISSED:** "Zone 3 does not depend on knowledge from Zone 2. The reader could read the zones in any order without losing comprehension." (L150) -- the ceiling counter-example showing what ABSENCE of pedagogical sequencing looks like.

#### 4. Cognitive Mode Transitions (L210-308)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** But:

**MISSED:** The complete 7-row transition table (L222-231) showing all 7 CD-006 transitions with their boundary, type, bridge text, and cognitive shift. This is the most complete reference for transition design.

**MISSED:** "Breathing transitions handle maximal cognitive shifts (where the reader needs silence to reset)." (L232) -- the rationale for prose-free breathing transitions.

**MISSED:** "These are metaphor-vocabulary labels, not cognitive-shift descriptions. They tell you WHERE you are in the metaphor, not HOW your thinking should shift." (L239) -- about the ceiling's labels.

#### 5. Structural Bookending Details (L311-402)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** But:

**MISSED:** The complete CD-006 bookend comparison:
- S1 HTML: `<div class="section-meta">Section 01 · Spiral · Geological Density</div>` + `<h2>Why Build from Tokens?</h2>` (L322-325)
- S8 HTML: `<div class="section-meta">Section 08 · Spiral · Geological Density</div>` + `<h2>What Comes Next</h2>` (L329-331)
- The specific structural elements that echo: "Same strata structure, same border-weight gradient, different content altitude." (L335)

**MISSED:** DD-006 bookend: "Opens with the fractal visualization (abstract concept). Closes with the Essence callout (synthesized insight)." (L339) -- a different bookend strategy (abstract→concrete rather than same-form-different-content).

#### 6. Meta-Annotation (L405-529)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** But:

**MISSED:** "The reader can ignore these (surface reading) or use them to understand the page's architectural decisions (structural reading)." (L419) -- the dual-reading concept.

**MISSED:** CD-006 footer provenance stamp detail: "DD:FRACTAL · OD:COMPOUND · AD:ALL" (L434) -- encoding dimension patterns in the footer.

**MISSED:** "These are metaphor vocabulary, not architectural meta-annotation. They tell you WHERE in the metaphor you are, not WHY the page makes specific structural choices." (L451) -- about the ceiling's zone indicators, distinguishing metaphor labels from architecture labels.

#### 7. Provenance Threading (L533-676)

**MOSTLY CAPTURED.** But:

**MISSED:** "The page generates NEW findings from its own construction. It is not just a product — it is an act of design research." (L574) -- about CD-006's generated findings. This is a key insight about the relationship between building and research.

**MISSED:** DD-006's inline threading header structure (L544-554): the specific format showing WHY THIS EXISTS, BUILT ON (with dependency table), MUST HONOR sections.

#### 8. Cross-Dimensional Integration Map (L679-733)

**PARTIALLY CAPTURED via file modifications.** But:

**MISSED:** The interaction table (L683-691) showing how dimensions enable, are enabled by, and conflict with each other. Key interactions:
- Self-Reference enables Pedagogical Sequencing ("content becomes its own proof")
- Bookending conflicts with "Pedagogical arcs that end on action, not reflection"
- Meta-Annotation conflicts with "Over-labeling (noise)"

**MISSED:** The estimated Pass 3 workload table (L725-733):
- Total: 93-168 lines HTML, 26-48 minutes
- "It is the cheapest pass in terms of mechanism cost and the highest in terms of perceived quality differentiation." (L735)

#### 9. Scoring Benchmarks (L769-776)

**MISSED:** DD-006 specific scores: "9/12 binary, 4/6 quality (lacks Navigation-scale meta-annotation, no threading header for provenance in rendered content)" (L772) -- the specific dimension failures.

**MISSED:** Ceiling specific scores: "2/12 binary, 0/6 quality (only partial meta-annotation via zone labels)" (L774) -- what the ceiling DID achieve.

#### 10. Final Summary Table (L784-794)

**MISSED:** "The intentionality layer is NOT magic. It is 6 concrete HTML/content additions." (L782) -- the demystification statement.

**MISSED:** The total cost/value summary: "Total cost: ~93-168 lines HTML/comments, ~6 lines CSS, ~26-48 minutes. Total value: 15-20% of crown jewel quality, the primary Ceiling-to-Flagship differentiator." (L793-794)

**MISSED:** "An Opus 4.6 agent with access to the metaphor derivation, build plan, and crown jewel examples can execute it in under 45 minutes." (L796) -- the feasibility assessment.

### SUMMARY for File 14
- **Total missed nuances:** 20+ items
- **Assessment:** This is one of the BEST extractions. The 18 danger zones are particularly well-captured. Main misses are specific HTML/CSS examples from crown jewels, the cross-dimensional interaction map, the workload estimates, and the scoring benchmarks.
- **Pattern:** The extraction captures prescriptive content (what to build, what to check) excellently but misses descriptive content (what the crown jewels look like specifically, how dimensions interact).

## CROSS-FILE OBSERVATIONS

### Systematic Patterns Across All 7 Files Checked

1. **Numbers and calculations are systematically lost.** Specific pixel values, percentages, time estimates, word counts, line counts, ratios -- all consistently missing from extractions. These numbers are the EVIDENCE that supports the prescriptions.

2. **Historical examples are condensed to references.** The extractions note "like CD-006" but lose the SPECIFIC HTML, CSS, and structural details that make the examples actionable. A builder needs to see the actual CSS, not just know that CD-006 did it.

3. **Theoretical frameworks are reduced to action items.** The 5 interaction types, the 2-axis model, the constraint density flip, the preparation paradox -- these FRAMEWORKS are lost because they are not direct action items. But they are essential for understanding WHY the action items matter.

4. **Counter-examples are systematically dropped.** What the ceiling did WRONG, what the Middle was MISSING, what DD-006 does BETTER than CD-006 -- these negative examples are almost entirely absent. They are as important as the positive examples for preventing known failures.

5. **Metaphors and analogies are stripped.** The music conservatory analogy, the tightrope walking metaphor, the "three instruments playing different songs" description -- these teaching tools are consistently lost. They are how the concepts become COMMUNICABLE to agents.

6. **The extraction quality correlates with file structure.** Files with clear action-item formatting (file 14 with its builder instructions blocks) extract well. Files with more narrative/analytical content (files 12, 13) lose more nuance.

### Recommendation

The extractions are EXCELLENT at capturing WHAT to do. They are weak at capturing WHY, WHAT-IF-NOT, and HOW-TO-TEACH-IT. For the master prompt assembly:
- Use extractions for the checklist/gate layer (Layer 2 execution spec, Layer 3 coordination)
- Return to ORIGINAL files for the conviction/teaching layer (Layer 1 conviction document)
- Include specific CSS examples from originals in builder guidance

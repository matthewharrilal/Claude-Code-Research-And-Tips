## FILE 1: S3-cross-experiment-wisdom.md

**Path:** `ephemeral/flagship-preparation/_pre-flight/S3-cross-experiment-wisdom.md`
**Lines:** 364
**Agent:** wisdom-extractor (Opus)

### Summary

This file captures EXPERIENTIAL (tacit) knowledge from actually running the Middle, Ceiling, and Mode 4 experiments. It documents 10 experiential laws observed across 3+ experiments, classifies 7 failure root causes (5 fully preventable, 2 manageable), identifies 5 cross-cutting patterns, and synthesizes 10 "do differently" and 9 "avoid" items for flagship. The core insight: the pipeline provides vocabulary and constraint, but cannot provide intention and restraint -- those emerge from metaphor + iteration and spatial awareness + designed silence, respectively.

### CRITICAL / BLOCKING Items

- **Preparation ceiling at ~100-200 lines.** Longer Middle prompt achieved better compliance than the 1,004-line Ceiling prompt. Beyond ~200 lines, additional rules DILUTE critical rules. Builder prompt must stay under 120 lines total.
- **Content inventory BEFORE metaphor selection.** Metaphor must adapt to content; content must NOT stretch to fill metaphor. Count renderable content per natural section. Only allow zones with >=800px of renderable material.
- **Mandatory messaging gates must be BINARY.** "MAY" = 0% compliance (Law 3). Convert all communication instructions to MUST.
- **At least 2 build passes with feedback.** CD-006 (multi-pass, 39/40) vs Middle/Ceiling (single-pass, B+ / spatial catastrophe). Single-pass building is inadequate for ceiling/flagship tier.

### Threshold Values

| Threshold | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Void budget maximum | 30% | Section IX.2 |
| Signal-to-silence ratio target | 0.6-0.7:1 | Section IX.7 |
| Minimum zone content | >=800px renderable | Section IV.3 |
| Preparation ceiling | ~100-200 lines | Law 10 |
| Builder prompt maximum | 120 lines | Section IX.5 |
| Kill criteria: cold-look NOs | 7+ at 1440px triggers rebuild | Section IX.10 |
| Metaphor survival rate gate | >=50% without labels | Section II.2 |
| Maximum structural patterns | 1 global metaphor | Section IX.6 |
| Maximum execution prompt | 200 lines | Section IX.5 |

### Conviction Layer Items (Theories, Metaphors, Exemplars)

1. **"Applied correctly vs felt through" gap** -- appeared in EVERY analysis stream. Rules produce compliance, metaphor produces intention, iteration produces confidence. All three are needed.
2. **"Designed" has two independent dimensions:** vocabulary fluency (knowing mechanisms) and compositional fluency (choosing mechanisms that EXPRESS a coherent concept). These are independent axes, not sequential.
3. **Signal-to-silence ratio matters more than signal quantity.** The page's best element (architecture diagram, ~3:1 silence-to-signal locally) worked because it was surrounded by designed silence.
4. **Restraint is a richness driver, not a limiter.** Richness follows a concave curve -- increases with complexity up to a point, then DECREASES as complexity overwhelms spatial confidence.
5. **The faithful execution trap.** Builders faithfully execute plans with structural problems. Each individual specification is reasonable; their AGGREGATE effect can be catastrophic.
6. **Concept quality does not predict product quality.** 12/12 metaphor concept produced 1.5/4 product PA-05 score (Law 9).
7. **CD-006 contrast table.** The outlier variables between CD-006 (39/40), Middle (B+), and Ceiling (1.5/4) are ITERATION + COMMUNICATION, not mechanism count or metaphor quality.

### Execution Spec Items (Binary Rules)

1. Binary rules achieve 100% compliance; judgment rules achieve 0% (Law 1)
2. Agents do not spontaneously communicate (Law 3) -- mandatory messaging checkpoints required
3. Mechanism deployment != mechanism perception (Law 4) -- track BOTH "N deployed" AND "M perceived"
4. When an auditor reports something "impossible," investigate before dismissing (Law 8)
5. No empty structural elements -- every HTML element must have visible content
6. Metaphors must NOT map 1:1 onto content vocabulary -- minimum semantic distance required
7. CSS fixes for architecture problems are banned -- classify defects as CSS/content/architecture BEFORE patching
8. Evaluate concepts for BUILDABILITY, not just COHERENCE
9. Pre-committed kill criteria before experiment starts: void >30% = STOP; 7+ cold-look NOs at 1440px = rebuild
10. Content inventory must precede metaphor selection

## FILE 2: S4-metacognitive-dimensions.md

**Path:** `ephemeral/flagship-preparation/_pre-flight/S4-metacognitive-dimensions.md`
**Lines:** 535
**Agent:** meta-dimensions (Opus 4.6)

### Summary

This file performs deep metacognitive analysis of blind spots, unconsidered dimensions, and assumptions that might be wrong. It evaluates whether constraint pressure should become a pipeline principle (YES, with qualifications), proposes operationalizing the anti-scale formula with target values, identifies 3 new failure modes the flagship plan creates (wall of content overcorrection, gate fatigue, competitive build selection bias), challenges 4 assumptions, identifies 5 things not being thought about (builder emotional state, reader journey, failure-as-information, calibrated expectations, exit criteria), and concludes definitively: "The analysis phase is COMPLETE. STOP ANALYZING. START BUILDING."

### CRITICAL / BLOCKING Items

- **Gate fatigue risk.** The plan has 47 evaluation points (24 kill criteria + 7 gates + 5 passes + 11 success targets). Gate overhead alone is ~235 minutes -- LONGER than estimated build time. Propose combining Gates 1+2 and Gates 3+4 to reduce from 7 to 4-5 gates.
- **22 agents exceeds validated flat-topology capacity by 83%.** Sweet spot is 8-12 agents. Propose 2-layer topology: team lead coordinates 5-6 phase leads, each coordinates 3-5 agents.
- **Calibration run should be MANDATORY, not recommended.** Finding a broken gate at calibration costs ~180 min; finding it at flagship costs ~320 min plus contaminated results.
- **Content selection is an unresolved BLOCKING question.** If selected content cannot support >=4/6 intentionality dimensions naturally, it is the WRONG content for flagship. Content selection should be a KB-level (kill-before) item.
- **Builder emotional state.** 240 lines of rules, gates, and kill criteria creates DEFENSIVE building stance. Restructure prompt so conviction layer is FIRST and LAST thing the builder reads.

### Threshold Values

| Threshold | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Semantic density floor | 0.60 | Section 3.2 |
| Semantic density target | 0.80+ | Section 3.2 |
| Semantic density crown jewel | 0.85-0.90 | Section 3.2 |
| Restraint ratio floor | 0.20 | Section 3.2 |
| Restraint ratio target | 0.50+ | Section 3.2 |
| Restraint ratio crown jewel | 0.60+ | Section 3.2 |

| Constraint pressure inflection | ~70% | Section 1.1 |
| Mechanism hard cap | 14 | Section 1.2 (Change A) |
| Restraint reject-to-deploy ratio | >=2.0 (if constraint pressure axiomatic) | Section 1.2 (Change B) |
| Attention budget per agent | ~100 units | Section 6, Finding 5 |
| Full Flagship probability | 55-65% (planner estimate, may be lower) | Section 7.4 |
| Minimum Viable probability | 85-90% | Section 7.4 |
| Gate count reduction target | 7 -> 4-5 | Section 4.1 (Failure Mode B) |
| Messaging quality threshold | (a+b) >= 30% of total messages | Section 4.2 (Assumption 4) |

### Conviction Layer Items

1. **Constraint pressure enables design intelligence.** Constraint pressure operates on VOCABULARY (which CSS properties carry meaning). Design intelligence operates on COMPOSITION (how those properties are arranged). Both are NECESSARY but individually INSUFFICIENT.
2. **Richness = Semantic Density x Restraint x Spatial Confidence x Intentionality (x Temporal Confidence).** Multiplicative model -- any zero collapses the result. Evaluation should identify and address the weakest factor first.
3. **Beauty definition as 4 tightropes.** "Warm without being soft, austere without being cold, authoritative without being aggressive, restrained without being empty." Beauty is walking all four simultaneously.
4. **The builder's mission is beauty, not compliance.** "You are building a warm, authoritative, unhurried page. The rules that follow are guardrails, not the mission. The mission is beauty."
5. **The preparation paradox.** Preparation is PRODUCTIVE for research infrastructure (reusable principles) and PATHOLOGICAL for execution readiness (diminishing returns on prompt quality).

### Execution Spec Items

1. Skeleton selection uses ONLY 7 spatial confidence checks (SC-01 through SC-07) -- no aesthetic judgment
2. If both skeletons pass all 7, select the one with LOWER void ratio (measurable)
3. Combine Gates 1+2 and Gates 3+4 where possible
4. Add "Channel Selection" step to Pass 0: identify 2-3 channels the content loads most heavily, propose 2-3 build-specific value-restrictions on other channels
5. Add 3 emotional response questions to Mode 4 audit: E1 (one-word feeling), E2 (care scale 1-5), E3 (bookmark yes/no) -- supplementary data, not gate criteria
6. Add "Learning Protocol" to abort/kill scenarios: document what was caught and why BEFORE aborting
7. Content must support >=4/6 intentionality dimensions naturally (kill criterion)
8. Log all messages and classify post-build: clarifications that changed build, anomaly flags that triggered fixes, acknowledgments with no impact, procedural compliance with no content

### Metacognitive Checklist for Flagship (from Appendix)

| Phase | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Pre-build | "Am I building to CREATE or to NOT-FAIL?" |
| Content selection | "Does this content naturally support 4+/6 intentionality dimensions?" |
| Metaphor derivation | "Does this metaphor create spatial obligations the content cannot fill?" |
| Pass 0 | "Have I designed the READER'S JOURNEY, not just the page layout?" |
| Pass 1 | "Is the skeleton beautiful AT THIS STAGE, before any mechanisms?" |
| Pass 2 | "Did I document more rejections than deployments?" |
| Pass 3 | "Can I identify zone boundaries WITHOUT reading labels?" |
| Pass 4 | "Does the intentionality feel emergent or bolted-on?" |
| Pre-audit | "Am I hoping the page passes or genuinely uncertain?" |
| Post-audit | "What did I learn, regardless of the verdict?" |
| Kill trigger | "What caused the violation, before I abort?" |

## FILE 3: V1-nuance-recovery-01-07.md

**Path:** `ephemeral/flagship-preparation/_pre-flight/V1-nuance-recovery-01-07.md`
**Lines:** 819
**Agent:** nuance-checker-1

### Summary

This file is a second-pass verification comparing original files 01-07 against their extraction outputs. It identifies 88 missed items and 4 cross-file discrepancies. The most significant finding is threshold DISCREPANCIES between files that must be resolved before execution prompt assembly. The systematic pattern: extractions captured WHAT to do but missed specific numbers/thresholds, worked examples (critical for agent learning), and rationale/reasoning.

### CRITICAL / BLOCKING Items

- **DISCREPANCY 1 (CRITICAL): Void threshold confusion.** Three different values for the same check:
  - SC-02 (spatial-confidence-gate.md): maxVoid <= 2,160px (uses 1.5 x 1440px viewport WIDTH -- likely an error)
  - SP-02 (kill-criteria.md): maxVoid <= 1,620px (uses 1.5 x 1080px viewport HEIGHT)
  - Correct calculation: 1.5 x 900px (actual viewport height at 1440px wide) = **1,350px**
  - **MUST RESOLVE before prompt assembly.**

- **DISCREPANCY 2: Header ratio threshold.**
  - SC-05 (spatial-confidence-gate.md): headerRatio <= 20%
  - SP-04 (kill-criteria.md): headerRatio <= 25%
  - **MUST RESOLVE: choose 20% (stricter) or 25% (lenient).**

- **DISCREPANCY 3: Content distribution threshold.**
  - PA lessons Checkpoint 2: Content >= 60% of scroll height
  - SC-03 / SP-03: Content >= 70%
  - Pre-build void budget: >= 60%
  - Resolution: 60% is pre-build estimate (with ~10% error margin); 70% is post-build measurement. Both are correct in context but flagging needed.

- **DISCREPANCY 4: Kill criteria uses 5 spatial checks (SP-01 through SP-05) while Spatial Gate uses 7 (SC-01 through SC-07).** Missing from kill criteria: SC-04 (squint test) and SC-06 (minimum content sections).

### Threshold Values (from missed items)

| Threshold | Value | File | Line |
|-----------|-------|------|------|
| PA hit rate: Spatial + Proportion | 100% (7/7) | File 01 | ~96 |
| PA hit rate: Flow + Pacing | 100% (5/5) | File 01 | ~96 |
| PA hit rate: Consistency + Rhythm | 50% (2/4) | File 01 | ~96 |

| Restraint ratio per tier: Middle | No documentation required | File 02 | ~268 |
| Restraint ratio per tier: Ceiling | 3+ rejected documented | File 02 | ~270 |
| Restraint ratio per tier: Flagship | 5+ rejected documented | File 02 | ~272 |
| Designed silence zone max | 6 (more risks sparse feeling) | File 04 | ~170 |
| Silence zone weighting | 2x (designed silence counts double) | File 04 | ~327 |

| Ceiling experiment max zones | 4 zones with 4 sections = ratio 1.0 -> FAIL | File 07 | ~75 |
| Zone color differentiation | >= 25 RGB value difference | File 07 | ~346 |
| FK-04 novelty tiered response: SHIP | >= 6 | File 07 | ~490 |
| FK-04 novelty: CONDITIONAL SHIP | = 5 (ceiling-equivalent) | File 07 | ~491 |
| FK-04 novelty: DO NOT SHIP | <= 4 | File 07 | ~492 |
| Scroll-through screenshot increment | 80% | File 01 | ~381 |
| Estimated recovery costs: Protocol A | 30-60 min | File 07 | ~741 |
| Estimated recovery costs: Protocol B | 60-90 min | File 07 | ~743 |
| Estimated recovery costs: Protocol D | 30 min | File 07 | ~746 |

### Conviction Layer Items

1. **Silence zones are NOT void.** They contain CONTENT (paragraphs, lists), just no mechanism CSS. Critical distinction.
2. **"Silence after silence is void, not restraint."** Designed silence requires CONTRAST with surrounding signal.
3. **Worked examples are critical for agent learning.** 12 worked examples were missed from extractions. Agents learn from examples, not rules.

### Execution Spec Items

1. Builder's 10 self-check has 4 BLOCKING questions (B-01, B-03, B-09, B-10) that require STOP-and-fix, and 6 non-blocking questions that require note-and-continue
2. CSS ALLOWLIST for silence zones: only `font-family: var(--font-body)`, `font-size: var(--type-body)`, `line-height: 1.7`, `color: var(--color-text)`, etc.
3. CSS PROHIBITLIST for silence zones: no `border-left`, no accent colors, no zone backgrounds, no pseudo-elements, no catalog mechanisms
4. Zone boundary requires ALL THREE conditions: content mass >=800px, content TYPE changes, reader INTENT changes
5. Same mechanism rejected at different locations counts as separate rejections for restraint ratio
6. Builder instructions block is exactly 33 lines (not "< 30" -- matters for prompt length budgeting)

## FILE 4: V2-nuance-recovery-08-14.md

**Path:** `ephemeral/flagship-preparation/_pre-flight/V2-nuance-recovery-08-14.md`
**Lines:** 977
**Agent:** nuance-checker-2

### Summary

This file verifies original files 08-14 against extraction outputs, identifying ~200+ missed nuances across 7 files. The dominant pattern: extractions capture WHAT each checkpoint/criterion does and its threshold, but systematically lose WHY it was designed that way and WHAT SPECIFIC HISTORICAL EVIDENCE motivated it. Most impactful missed categories: concrete CSS examples (22 micro-techniques from crown jewels), theoretical frameworks (5 interaction types, 2-axis model, constraint density flip), and the 3-phase constraint density model. The strongest extraction was File 14 (intentionality layer); the weakest was File 11 (crown jewel forensics).

### CRITICAL / BLOCKING Items

- **Performative checkpoint pattern.** "Ask yourself: is the concept buildable?" is performative. Agent writes "Yes" and rationalizes. ANTI-PATTERN: every checkpoint must require the agent to PRODUCE SOMETHING (artifact requirement).
- **The 3-phase constraint density flip.** At ~50-80 rules, builder cannot hold all rules simultaneously. At 20+ binary rules, binary rules compete ("satisfy checklist" strategy). At 100+ total rules, judgment rules get zero attention. The flagship is 2-3x beyond the ceiling's already-problematic rule count.
- **Preparation creates failure modes it cannot address.** The preparation itself introduces NEW failure modes (prompt overload, overcorrection, attention fragmentation) that are CAUSED by the preparation. The most dangerous document is the one that makes us feel most safe.
- **FM-5: Intentionality layer may be cosmetic.** Pass 3 agent RECEIVES a completed page and CAN ONLY ADD content. This structural constraint makes intentionality ADDITIVE by definition. CD-006's intentionality was designed in from the start; flagship's modular approach has never been tested.
- **Zero components feel forced in CD-006.** "Content DEMANDED the structure" -- the single most important quality signal from the crown jewel forensics file.

### Threshold Values

| Threshold | Value | File |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Cumulative whitespace from 3 sources (ceiling) | ~2,180px | File 08 |
| New whitespace added by Pass 2 mechanisms | 400-600px | File 09 (FM-2) |
| Inter-zone transitions % of page height | 8-12% (15-20% for 4+ zones) | File 09 (FM-3) |
| Void budget cap vs zone transitions | 15% cap vs 15-20% for 4+ zones = CONFLICT | File 09 (FM-3) |
| Late detection cost | 60-80 min wasted build + 20-40 min fix cycles | File 09 (FM-3) |
| Metaphor achievable range | 40% to 55-60% (under soul constraints) | File 09 (FM-9) |
| Structural metaphor threshold (unachievable) | >80% | File 09 (FM-9) |
| Builder effective context: % of prompt consumed | Builder 10-15%, Team-lead 80% | File 10 |
| Prompt captured by builder | ~4% of preparation corpus | File 09 (Appendix) |
| Max per-agent checkpoint count | 7 (within attention budget) | File 08 |
| 5-minute spatial budget calculation | Would have prevented entire ceiling failure cascade | File 08 |
| Compliance-complexity correlation | Simple binary: 100%, Capability: 0%, Judgment: ~40%, Multi-step judgment: 0% | File 10 |
| DD-006 CSS stats | 600 lines, ~250 declarations, 42 classes, 26 tokens | File 11 |
| CD-006 CSS stats | 1,035 lines, ~550 declarations, 95+ classes, 54 tokens | File 11 |
| DD-006 magic distribution | 30% CSS, 40% HTML, 30% content | File 11 |
| CD-006 magic distribution | 40% CSS, 35% HTML, 25% content | File 11 |
| Intentionality quality contribution | 15-20% of crown jewel quality | File 14 |
| Pass 3 estimated workload | 93-168 lines HTML, 26-48 min | File 14 |
| Intentionality scores: CD-006 | 6/6 | File 14 |
| Intentionality scores: DD-006 | 4/6 | File 14 |
| Intentionality scores: Ceiling | 0/6 | File 14 |

### Conviction Layer Items

1. **5 interaction types taxonomy** (from File 13 -- most important contribution missed by extraction):
   - REINFORCING: multiple mechanisms encode same meaning through different channels
   - MODULATING: one mechanism controls another's intensity
   - RESPONDING: one mechanism's visual weight creates condition the next responds to
   - CONTRASTING: presence in one zone makes absence in another meaningful
   - CASCADING: chain where each mechanism enables the next
2. **Beauty = confident intention at every scale of attention.** The antonym of confident is not ugly -- it is TENTATIVE. Templates cannot produce this quality; only composition can.
3. **The 2-axis model.** Vocabulary fluency (x-axis) and compositional fluency (y-axis) are ORTHOGONAL. Middle moved along vocabulary (5->12 mechanisms) without moving on composition. The move from Middle to Flagship is orthogonal, not linear.
4. **"Composition can be scaffolded but not specified."** The metaphor IS the compositional framework.
5. **DD-006's beauty = constraint as generative force.** CD-006's beauty = compositional confidence ("the sense that someone conducted the page like an orchestra").
6. **Perceptual sequence (from File 12):** Not F-pattern, not Z-pattern. "Descent with pauses." 8-step pattern: land, pause, scan, encounter, pause, resume, encounter rhythm, arrive.
7. **"The most important quality signal: content DEMANDED the structure."** Zero components feel forced in CD-006. Content-form fit is the highest quality indicator.

### Execution Spec Items

1. Every checkpoint must require the agent to PRODUCE SOMETHING (14 of 19 checkpoints require artifacts)
2. "Process-reason justifications are explicitly banned." -- "The reader would lose compliance with the mechanism mandate" is NOT acceptable retention reasoning
3. Subtraction test: if 3/3 mechanisms survive, well-chosen; if 2/3 removed, builder adding complexity for its own sake
4. Each pass receives ALL previous pass outputs (not just immediate predecessor) -- prevents telephone game
5. Novelty is explicitly labeled as a PROCESS metric, not product metric -- should NOT override quality verdict
6. Voice guide required: prose style + HTML structural patterns + content conventions from Pass 1 to prevent seam visibility
7. Designed moment distribution: show WHERE they are on scroll axis (factual, verifiable) rather than "do you have enough?" (builder always answers yes)
8. "The fix team asked 'what CSS values produce this void?' instead of 'why does this zone have more space than content?'" -- diagnosis question formulation matters
9. Builder prompt must be FIRST conviction, LAST conviction, with execution spec between (prompt psychology = prompt engineering for LLMs)

## FILE 5: V3-nuance-recovery-15-21.md

**Path:** `ephemeral/flagship-preparation/_pre-flight/V3-nuance-recovery-15-21.md`
**Lines:** 556
**Agent:** nuance-checker-3

### Summary

This file verifies original files 15-21 against extraction outputs, identifying 65 missed nuances (7 SIGNIFICANT, 26 MODERATE, 32 MINOR). The most critical misses: per-act mechanism deployment recommendations, falsification criteria for hypothesis testing, the scale-attention matrix, the inflection point analysis (KortAI is only 1 channel from the edge), communication as attention redistribution theory, and the diminishing returns curve with quality percentages per pass. Key theme: extractions capture SPECIFICATIONS but miss THEORIES that explain why specifications work.

### CRITICAL / BLOCKING Items

- **KortAI is CLOSE to the inflection point.** Documentation needs ~5 channels minimum. Current KortAI has ~6 surviving channels. Margin: 1 channel (~17% overhead). Adding 2-3 more absolute prohibitions would push the system to the edge. Only VALUE RESTRICTIONS are safe, not CHANNEL CLOSURES.
- **Scale-attention matrix.** 1 scale: ~10% attention consumed, 4/4 quality. 2 scales: ~20%, 4/4. 3 scales: ~35%, 3-4/4. 4 scales: ~55%, 1.5-3/4 (risky). 5 scales: ~75%, 0.5-2/4 (likely failure). 6 scales: ~90%, catastrophic. Attention consumption per scale is NOT linear -- it accelerates due to combinatorial interactions.
- **Diminishing returns curve.** Passes 1-3 produce ~93% quality in ~160 min. Passes 4-6 add ~5% in ~70 more min. ROI per minute drops ~4x after Pass 3. The cliff is between Pass 3 and Pass 4.
- **Communication as attention redistribution.** Messaging does NOT create more total attention but REDISTRIBUTES attention from agents with surplus to agents with deficit. Builder messages planner about spatial concern -> planner uses ITS attention budget for spatial reasoning the builder cannot afford.
- **Void threshold discrepancy** confirmed: SP-02 uses 1620px, SC-02 uses 2160px. Must reconcile.

| Attention budget per rule at 100 rules | 1% each | File 19 |
| Attention budget per rule at 150 rules | 0.67% each | File 19 |

### Conviction Layer Items

1. **Constraint pressure as Shannon's channel capacity.** When channels close, S/N increases per remaining channel -- less competition. A 1px vs 4px border in KortAI carries more perceptual meaning than the same distinction in Material Design.
2. **4 types of constraints with differential effects:** Channel closure (HIGH pressure), Value restriction (MODERATE), Contextual prohibition (LOW), Process constraint (ZERO pressure). For flagship: value restrictions are safest.
3. **Communication as attention redistribution** -- messaging transfers cognitive work from overloaded agents to underloaded ones.
4. **Texture promise rule.** Every texture promise in the first 2-3 seconds MUST be honored throughout the scroll. Opening textures create OBLIGATIONS.
5. **Quality exemplar in execution prompt.** 20 lines from CD-006 showing one designed transition zone + 20 lines from DD-006 showing fractal coherence. Show code examples for FEEL, not for copying.

### Execution Spec Items

1. 4 types of constraints: use VALUE RESTRICTIONS for additional pressure (not channel closures)
2. Each pass must target 2 scales maximum (per scale-attention matrix)
3. Calibration run MUST use DIFFERENT content from flagship (continuation bias contamination)
4. Time-based downgrade paths at 240 min: staged response based on which pass is complete
5. Falsification criteria to watch during flagship: 5 specific observational tests
6. 56-rule prompt means each gets ~1/56th of builder attention -- most critical rule gets same weight as least important

### Summary

This file documents the current state of 4 core design system files (prohibitions.md, mechanism-catalog.md, tokens.css, semantic-rules.md) and assesses each against the 7 BLOCKING enrichment gaps. The verdict: 4 gaps are FULLY ABSENT, 2 are PARTIALLY PRESENT (in wrong files or different scope), and 0 are PRESENT. All 7 BLOCKING enrichments need to be applied. Zero overlap with the prior Enrichment Execution Team work -- the two work streams are complementary (existing enrichments make mechanisms RICHER to deploy; the 7 BLOCKING gaps make deployment SAFER).

### CRITICAL / BLOCKING Items

- **ALL 7 BLOCKING gaps are unapplied.** None have been written into the design system files. Insertable text is READY (total ~328 lines across 4 files).
- **Gap status summary:**
  - B1 (maximum whitespace prohibition) -> prohibitions.md: **ABSENT**
  - A1 (transition grammar between zones) -> mechanism-catalog.md: **PARTIALLY PRESENT** (wrong file, different scope)
  - A2 (restraint principle) -> mechanism-catalog.md: **ABSENT**
  - A3 (content density minimum per zone) -> semantic-rules.md: **PARTIALLY PRESENT** (different scope)
  - B3 (front-loaded visual weight prohibition) -> prohibitions.md: **ABSENT**
  - C3 (maximum spacing token, 96px cap) -> tokens.css: **ABSENT**
  - D3 (content-form fit guidance) -> semantic-rules.md: **ABSENT**

### Threshold Values

| Threshold | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Current prohibitions count | 8 absolute + 12 conditional + 2 meta = 22 total | prohibitions.md |
| Current mechanism count | 18 | mechanism-catalog.md |
| Current spacing scale max | --space-24: 96px ("Sparse ocean") | tokens.css |
| Current transition token | --transition-standard: 0.3s ease | tokens.css |
| Sparse zone padding range | 40-80px | semantic-rules.md Gap 4 |
| Dense zone padding range | 16-32px | semantic-rules.md Gap 4 |
| Total lines to add | ~328 across 4 files | Assessment |

### Conviction Layer Items

None specific -- this is a state assessment, not a theory document.

### Execution Spec Items

1. Recommended insertion order: B1 -> C3 -> A3 -> D3 -> A1 -> A2 -> B3
2. B1 adds prohibition #21 (conditional) -- update summary statistics from 12 to 13 conditional, 22 to 23 total
3. C3 is 8 lines -- smallest change, highest leverage (token-level prevention)
4. A1 adds CHECKPOINT transition type (not in existing compositional-rules.md)
5. Existing compositional-rules.md has "BREATHING transition: 96px+" with PLUS sign -- A1 CAPS this at 96px

## FILE 7: 09-state-skills.md

**Path:** `ephemeral/flagship-preparation/_pre-flight/09-state-skills.md`
**Lines:** 292
**Agent:** state-assessor-2

### Summary

This file documents the current state of both skill files (tension-composition SKILL.md at 1,878 lines and perceptual-auditing SKILL.md at 774 lines) and assesses them against 3 needed enrichments: void prevention gate, void detection question (PA-49), and Ceiling+ spatial safeguards. All 3 are ABSENT -- existing content addresses void prevention INDIRECTLY but lacks the BINARY GATES and EXPLICIT THRESHOLDS identified as necessary. The design principle: enrichments go to design system files; skill files REFERENCE the enriched files. Skill modifications are pointers, not duplicates.

### CRITICAL / BLOCKING Items

- **PA-49 void detection question is ABSENT.** The current skill has 48 questions. PA-49 ("Is there any point where you can scroll through an entire viewport height without seeing substantial content?") does NOT exist. This catches the ceiling experiment's exact failure mode.
- **PA-50 density overcorrection question is ABSENT.** ("Is there any point where you can scroll through entire viewport without a VISUAL BREAK?") This catches the mirror failure mode (wall of content).
- **No void prevention gate in tension-composition SKILL.md.** W-DEADZONE warning exists but is a WARNING not a GATE. No void budget calculation, no SC gate reference, no content-to-void ratio threshold.
- **No Ceiling+ spatial safeguards in either skill file.** The term "spatial confidence" never appears. No reference to SC-01 through SC-07.

### Threshold Values

| Threshold | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Tension-composition SKILL.md current lines | 1,878 | Assessment |
| Perceptual-auditing SKILL.md current lines | 774 | Assessment |
| Prior enrichment: mechanism count range inconsistency | Phase 4.0 shows 5-10/8-12/12-15 vs Phase 0D shows 8-10/12-15/16-18 | Known issue (cosmetic, FIX RECOMMENDED) |
| Existing container width | 940-960px (NON-NEGOTIABLE, 3+ locations) | SKILL.md Phase 4.0 |
| Existing CPL target | 45-80 | SKILL.md Phase 4.0 |
| Existing content-to-viewport ratio | 65-80% | SKILL.md Phase 4.0 |
| Existing compression ratio | >= 40% | SKILL.md Phase 4.0 |
| Existing macro whitespace allocation | 30% min, 35-45% optimal, 60% max | PA SKILL.md |
| Existing dead zone max breathing | 24px margins | PA SKILL.md |
| Needed: content-to-void ratio (pre-build) | >= 60:40 | Recommendation |
| Needed: max contiguous void | 1.5 viewport heights | From SC gate |
| Needed: content distribution (post-build) | >= 70% | From SC gate |

### Conviction Layer Items

None specific -- this is a state assessment.

### Execution Spec Items

1. PA-49 insertion: 5 lines, highest ROI, simple insertion after PA-47
2. SC gate reference in SKILL.md: 20-30 lines, adds gate reference + void budget check to Phase 0D and Phase 4
3. Ceiling+ spatial safeguards: 40-60 lines (zone count ceiling, spacing cap, mechanism distribution/cap, restraint protocol reference)
4. Critical path: (1) Apply 7 BLOCKING enrichments to 4 design system files, (2) Add PA-49 to PA SKILL.md, (3) Add SC gate reference to tension-composition SKILL.md, (4) Verify enriched files are readable by agents

## FILE 8: 10-state-existing-work.md

**Lines:** 401
**Agent:** state-assessor-3

### Summary

This file provides a comprehensive inventory of ALL enrichment and preparation work done to date. It documents 16 enrichments already applied (E1-E11 across 3 files + 2 new protocol docs + 2 status file updates), all 10 critical path items from the ceiling preparation brief (ALL FULLY ADDRESSED), the 8 files produced by the ceiling experiment, the 7 BLOCKING gaps (NONE applied -- insertable text ready), and the 20 flagship preparation team deliverables. The critical path to flagship is: (1) apply 7 BLOCKING enrichments ~2 hours, (2) create execution prompt ~3-4 hours, (3) define topology + slices ~1-2 hours, (4) execute experiment ~320 min, (5) Mode 4 audit ~60 min. Total estimated: 12-15 hours.

### CRITICAL / BLOCKING Items

- **NONE of the 7 BLOCKING gaps have been applied to the design system.** All were IDENTIFIED, SPECIFIED with insertable text, and DOCUMENTED in the unified action plan. The file modifications have NOT been made.
- **The flagship execution prompt must be REBUILT from scratch.** The ceiling prompt (1,004 lines) was too long. Flagship needs 4-layer architecture: 70-line conviction + 100-120 line execution spec + 60-line coordination spec + reference library (existing files). Total execution spec <= 200 lines.
- **Mode 4 PA is ESSENTIAL for flagship.** The 2-PA ceiling audit ENTIRELY MISSED the dominant defect. Mode 4 (9+ independent auditors, screenshot pre-capture) found it 9/9 unanimous.
- **Minor inconsistency unfixed:** Phase 4.0 natural landing table shows Middle 5-10 vs Phase 0D shows Middle 8-10. Fix recommended (5 min) but not done.

### Threshold Values

| Threshold | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Pre-ceiling enrichments applied | 16 items across 3 files + 2 new docs | E1-E11 inventory |
| BLOCKING gaps insertable text total | ~328 lines across 4 files | 02-enrichment-specifications.md |
| Ceiling prompt length | 1,004 lines (~56 rules, compressed from 248) | CEILING-MASTER-EXECUTION-PROMPT.md |
| Flagship prompt target | <= 200 lines (4-layer architecture) | Prompt architecture recommendation |
| Estimated wall time Steps 1-5 | 12-15 hours | Critical path assessment |
| Calibration run recommendation | STRONGLY recommended between Steps 3 and 4 | Assessment |

### Conviction Layer Items

None specific -- this is an inventory document.

### Execution Spec Items

1. All pre-ceiling enrichments (E1-E6) PERSIST and remain valid -- flagship adds ON TOP of these
2. Mechanism catalog enrichments (E7-E9) persist -- flagship adds transition grammar (A1) and restraint protocol (A2) to catalog
3. PA-05 PROPORTIONATE sub-criterion may need strengthening (previous 3/4 became 1.5/4 under Mode 4)
4. Communication protocol: ceiling specified messaging but 0 messages occurred. Flagship converts "CAN message" to "MUST message"
5. Programmatic audit must be SPATIAL-FIRST (runs BEFORE mechanism audit)
6. PROMPT-SLICING-STRATEGY.md principles apply but need new slices for flagship's different agent topology
7. The 7 BLOCKING gaps address post-ceiling-experiment findings -- these are NET NEW, not duplicates of pre-ceiling enrichments

### Work Categories

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| DONE (persists in design system) | 16 items: M1, rhythm variation, landmark gate, heading ratio, token compliance, ceiling context, container width, CPL formula, impact profiles, application modes, zone mappings, PA-05 sub-criteria, rhythm elevation, fresh-eyes principle, margin collapse warning, CLAUDE.md updates |
| NOT DONE (specified, not applied) | 7 BLOCKING gaps + 1 minor fix |
| NOT DONE (research complete, needs conversion) | 8 items: execution prompt, agent topology, SC gate protocol, communication protocol, kill criteria, content-first methodology, embedded auditor, adversarial premortem integration |

## CROSS-FILE SYNTHESIS

### Items Affecting Flagship Execution Prompt

#### Must-Resolve Discrepancies (from V1)

1. **Void threshold:** 1,350px (1.5 x 900px viewport height) should be the correct value. Both 2,160px and 1,620px are wrong.
2. **Header ratio:** Recommend 20% (stricter) as the single threshold.
3. **Content distribution:** 60% pre-build, 70% post-build -- document both clearly.
4. **Kill criteria SC coverage:** Add SC-04 (squint test) and SC-06 (minimum content sections) to kill criteria.

#### Most Critical Binary Rules for Execution Spec

1. Container width 940-960px (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
2. Void budget <= 30%
3. Max contiguous void <= 1,350px (1.5 x 900px viewport height)
4. Content distribution >= 70% (post-build)
5. Header ratio <= 20% of first viewport
6. Signal-to-silence ratio 0.6-0.8:1
7. Mechanism cap: 14 hard maximum
8. Restraint ratio: rejected/deployed >= 1.5
9. Silence zones: >= 2 documented
10. Designed moment in second half of page (B3)
11. Maximum spacing: 96px (--space-max-zone)
12. Content per zone: >= 3 paragraphs OR >= 2 components
13. Zone count ceiling by word count
14. Metaphor survival >= 50% without labels
15. Builder prompt <= 120 lines
16. All communication instructions are MUST, not MAY

#### Most Critical Conviction Items for Layer 1

1. Beauty = confident intention at every scale. The mission is beauty, not compliance.
2. Composition can be scaffolded but not specified. The metaphor IS the compositional framework.
3. Restraint is a richness driver. Richness = semantic density x restraint x spatial confidence x intentionality.
4. Signal-to-silence ratio matters more than signal quantity.
5. "Applied correctly vs felt through" -- rules produce compliance, metaphor produces intention, iteration produces confidence. All three needed.
6. Content DEMANDED the structure (zero forced components = highest quality signal).
7. The 5 interaction types: reinforcing, modulating, responding, contrasting, cascading.
8. Constraint pressure: when channels close, surviving channels carry more semantic weight.

#### Critical Path (from File 8)

```
Step 1: Apply 7 BLOCKING enrichments [~2 hours]
Step 2: Create flagship execution prompt [~3-4 hours]
Step 3: Define agent topology + prompt slices [~1-2 hours]
Step 4: Calibration run (RECOMMENDED) [~2-3 hours]
Step 5: Execute flagship [~320 min / ~5.3 hours]
Step 6: Mode 4 audit [~60 min]
```

# Cold Look — Visual Auditor Beta — AD-004 Spiral

**Gut reaction:** This feels serious and layered, like opening a geology textbook — the dark header grounds you, and then the content area feels academic and deliberate, with a sidebar that looks like a specimen card.

**Worst thing:** The "Confidence: HIGH" badge next to "Established" looks like a placeholder label floating awkwardly — it has a thin border around it that feels tentative and cheap next to the authoritative heading.

**Best thing:** The Essence callout in the sidebar — the italic text "Four pixels of certainty" is genuinely evocative and gives the whole metadata panel a human heartbeat.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

**Gut reaction:** This feels cramped and heavy at the top — the sidebar metadata card is fighting with the body text for space, and the code blocks dominate the lower half. It is like trying to read a textbook while someone holds a reference card in front of your face.

**Worst thing:** The metadata sidebar and body text are side by side but competing for a narrow screen — neither has room to breathe. The two-column layout that felt natural at 1440px feels forced here.

**Best thing:** The dark header section scales well — the title, subtitle, and navigation tabs still feel commanding and clear even at this narrower width.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

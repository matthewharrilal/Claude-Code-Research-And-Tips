# Cold Look — Auditor D (Hierarchy + Coherence + Cross-Page)

## 1440px Cold Look

- **Gut reaction:** Authoritative and confident. The dark header band with the tall serif title feels like the opening of a serious design treatise. The warm cream body below is inviting. There is an immediate sense of authored authority — this page knows what it wants to say.
- **Worst thing:** The gap between the dark header band and the first section content feels slightly excessive — there is a lot of dead air before Section 01 arrives. The eye wants to jump there faster. Also, the left column of text and right column of pattern echo thumbnails in Section 01 are separated by a noticeable gap.
- **Best thing:** The title typography is commanding. "The Convergence" in that tall serif feels authored, intentional, premium. The six pattern-echo thumbnails (Z, F, BENTO, SPIRAL, CHOREO, ALL) are genuinely delightful — small, crisp, red-on-dark miniatures that communicate the concept immediately.
- **Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## 768px Cold Look

- **Gut reaction:** The header still commands attention. The content adapts and flows downward. But below the Z-pattern overview, the Bento Grid section (Section 3) suffers a catastrophic layout collapse — the featured card's text stacks one character per line vertically, creating a tower of single letters.
- **Worst thing:** The Bento Grid section is completely unreadable. The featured "Compound Axis" card becomes a single-character-per-line tower — "T, h, e, m, e, t, a, -, p, a, t, t, e, r, n" — stretching the section to an absurd height.
- **Best thing:** Sections 1 and 2 still read well at this width. The typography hierarchy remains clear. The header adapts gracefully.
- **Ship verdict:** NO (Bento section is broken at this width)

## 1024px Cold Look

- **Gut reaction:** This is the sweet spot. Everything from the 1440px version is present and proportional. The content breathes well. The pattern echo grid is visible and well-sized.
- **Worst thing:** The gap between header band and Section 01 is still present but proportionally less noticeable. The same hidden-content issue (Sections 06-07) persists.
- **Best thing:** All layouts hold. The bento grid cards are readable and proportional. The three-column comparison in Section 2 is legible and balanced.
- **Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS (hidden content in later sections is viewport-independent)

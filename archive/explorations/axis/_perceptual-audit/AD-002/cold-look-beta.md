# Cold Look — Auditor Beta (AD-002: F-Pattern Layout)

## 1440px Viewport

**Gut reaction:** Confident, editorial document with strong typographic presence and a clear dark-to-light transition from header to body.

**Worst thing:** The segmented progress bar below "ACT I -- EXPOSITION" feels like a dashboard widget dropped into an editorial layout. The colored/gray bar chunks don't match the page's otherwise refined character.

**Best thing:** The heading typography is striking and immediately commands attention; the left-aligned red accent bar on the subheading creates a strong visual anchor that reinforces the F-pattern's left-spine reading axis.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

**Gut reaction:** Tighter and more compact; the narrower width actually makes the text feel more intimate and the left-aligned F-pattern even more natural.

**Worst thing:** The progress bar segments become tiny and lose their readability at this width -- they look like random colored slivers rather than a meaningful progress indicator.

**Best thing:** The body text fills the width naturally without feeling cramped; the left edge alignment is even stronger here because there is less wasted space to the right.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

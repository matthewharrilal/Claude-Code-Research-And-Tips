# Cold Look — Auditor A (Impression + Emotion)
## AD-005: Choreography — 1440px

**Gut reaction:** Confident and editorial. The dark header with warm serif title creates a commanding opening — it feels like the front page of a well-designed magazine feature. The transition from the dark header to the warm cream content zone is smooth and deliberate. This page knows what it is.

**Worst thing:** The progress bar (a thin segmented strip just above the territory grid) feels like a foreign UI element dropped into an otherwise purely editorial environment. Its small segmented blocks with a red active indicator feel utilitarian and app-like, breaking the magazine tone. It also lacks breathing room — it sits too close to the content above and the grid below.

**Best thing:** The territory card grid is immediately compelling. The Featured Territory card is noticeably wider, giving it proper dominance, while the smaller Territory A and Territory B cards maintain clear visual structure. The serif headings in the cards ("CSS Transition Choreography", "Shot Progression", "Diagonal Accents") feel like chapter titles in a book — editorial and inviting.

**Ship verdict:** SHIP WITH NOTES. The page's editorial confidence is its greatest strength. The header is strong, the typography is warm and readable, the grid structure shows clear hierarchy. The progress bar is the primary sore spot — it needs to either integrate with the page's editorial language or step back visually. A few spatial adjustments would elevate this from "good" to "excellent."

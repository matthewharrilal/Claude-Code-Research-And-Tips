# Cold Look — Auditor C (Spatial + Grid)
## AD-005: Choreography
### First 30-second impression before any analysis

**What I see before thinking:**

A page that breathes in waves. Dark header at top, then a warm cream expanse with a grid of bordered tiles — one larger on the left, two smaller stacked on the right. Below that, a second row of four equal-sized tiles. Between the tile area and what comes next, there is a generous zone of emptiness with centered text — "AXIS DIRECTION CHANGE / Descending into Detail" — and then the tone shifts to long-form reading with a different background zone.

The page has a strong vertical spine. Content sits within a centered channel that feels like roughly 60-65% of the viewport width at desktop. The remaining space on either side is bare cream wall. The grid area uses that channel efficiently with its tile arrangement. Then the spokes (detailed reading sections) narrow further — the text column feels even narrower within the channel.

There is a distinct pulse: open space, then tiles, then open space, then dense reading, then open space again. The diagonal transition zones (dark angled bands) break the vertical flow with intentional asymmetry. The "AXIS DIRECTION CHANGE" labels sit in these transitional breathing zones.

At a squint, the page reads as: dark bar, cream field with rectangular shapes, dark diagonal, column of text with dark code blocks interspersed, another dark diagonal, more text column, then a final section with tables. The rhythm is not random — it alternates between sparse overview and dense detail in a pattern I can feel before I can name it.

**Immediate spatial reactions:**
- The left margin of content appears very consistent throughout — everything aligns to the same invisible left wall
- The hub grid tiles have comfortable internal spacing — text doesn't press against edges
- The diagonal transition zones create intentional spatial disruption — they feel like deliberate punctuation
- There is a LOT of whitespace between the end of one section and the start of the next — some of it may be excessive
- Code blocks (dark rectangles) are the densest visual elements and they create a strong visual weight pattern
- Tables create horizontal striping that contrasts with the predominantly vertical reading flow

## Second-Pass Cold Look (Fresh Instance)

**Additional first impressions from independent re-examination:**

- At 1440px, the full-page height is approximately 11,800px — a very tall page
- Multiple entirely blank viewports appear during scroll-through (scroll positions ~4320 and ~7920), likely scroll-reveal ghost zones
- The hub grid at 768px collapses to single-column stack as expected by responsive design; horizontal scanning intent is lost
- At 1024px, the 2-column grid is an effective intermediate between the full grid and the stack
- The dark code blocks and diagonal transition bands remain the strongest spatial anchors at every breakpoint
- The overall impression confirms the first pass: this page breathes in waves, with deliberate alternation between sparse and dense zones

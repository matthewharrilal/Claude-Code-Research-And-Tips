# Cold Look — Auditor B (Readability + Responsiveness)
## AD-005: Choreography

### 1440px — Initial Cold Look

- **Gut reaction:** Elegant, editorial feel. Dark header with a strong red accent bar. The page has a confident, magazine-like structure. The territory grid below looks like a well-organized table of contents.
- **Worst thing:** The territory cards on the right (Territory A "Shot Progression" and Territory B "Diagonal Accents") appear to have noticeably narrower columns than the Featured Territory card on the left, creating a slight cramped feeling in those smaller cards where text is breaking to short lines.
- **Best thing:** The header area is commanding. The "Establishing Shot" callout with the left blue accent bar has excellent visual hierarchy and breathing room. The overall typographic scale feels intentional.
- **Ship verdict:** CONDITIONAL SHIP — The hub overview area is strong, but need to scroll through full page to check reading comfort in denser sections.

### 768px — Cold Look

- **Gut reaction:** Surprisingly well-adapted. The page feels purposeful at this width, not squeezed. The featured territory card occupies full width gracefully. Territory cards collapse to a comfortable 2-column grid.
- **Worst thing:** Tables with 4 columns become tight — "Sparse (~200 words/viewport)" wraps to two lines. The table text is small but still legible.
- **Best thing:** Body text line length at this width is natural and easy to track. The "Establishing Shot" callout text reads comfortably. Code blocks fit without horizontal overflow.
- **Ship verdict:** CONDITIONAL SHIP — Tables are tight but functional. No text is unreadable.

### 1024px — Cold Look

- **Gut reaction:** This is the most comfortable reading width. Clean intermediate state between mobile and desktop. Body text has ideal line length (roughly 65-75 characters per line).
- **Worst thing:** The header subtitle text (light gray on dark background) has somewhat low contrast — could be hard to read in lower-brightness environments.
- **Best thing:** The "Establishing Shot" callout has perfect line length. The progress bar with red segment is nicely visible. Territory cards in 2-column grid have generous room.
- **Ship verdict:** SHIP — This is the best of the three viewports for reading comfort.

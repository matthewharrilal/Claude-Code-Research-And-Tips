# Cold Look — Beta Auditor (AD-003 Bento Grid)

## COLD LOOK (1440px)

**Gut reaction:** The page feels scholarly and restrained — like an architecture textbook — with the dark header projecting authority, but the content below feels narrower than this wide screen deserves.

**Worst thing:** The content area feels like it is sitting in a tube — there is a huge amount of empty space on both sides, especially on the right, making the 1440px screen feel wasted. The "Building with Bento Grid Layouts" box looks like a card floating in a canyon.

**Best thing:** The dark header with its warm cream text has real presence and gravitas. The prerequisite table inside the overview box is cleanly organized and legible.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## COLD LOOK (768px)

**Gut reaction:** Much better proportioned than 1440px — the content fills the width more naturally, the overview box and table feel substantial. But the bento grid cards are still two-to-three columns wide and that feels cramped at this width.

**Worst thing:** The bento grid does NOT collapse to a single column at 768px — it remains multi-column with cells squeezed tight. Text in narrower cells is getting crushed against borders.

**Best thing:** The header-to-overview transition feels confident and properly weighted. The prerequisite table is very readable at this width.

**Ship verdict:** YES WITH RESERVATIONS

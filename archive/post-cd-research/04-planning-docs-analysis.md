# Planning Documents Analysis (01-09)
## Deep Analysis of Post-CD Pipeline Architecture

**Agent:** Planning Document Analyst
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Source:** `design-system/pipeline/` numbered documents 01-09
**Files Analyzed:** 9 documents, ~9,200 total lines

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 9 numbered planning documents represent a **strategic evolution** from the original "CD → Migration" vision to a **sophisticated dual-track architecture** that emerged through 15+ research files and 3 critical discoveries:

1. **The 3-Way Equivalence Discovery** (AD-F-023): Density = Organization = Axis = Attention Topology
2. **The Component Taxonomy Discovery**: Only 60-70% extractable, remaining 30-40% must be composed fresh
3. **The Two-Track Reality**: Track 1 (assembly, 40-50% of pages) vs Track 2 (composition, 50-60% of pages)

**Timeline Impact:** Original estimate of 34-68 hours expanded to **150-325 hours** due to Track 2 creative bottleneck.

**Critical Insight:** For Track 2, the pipeline IS NOT software — it's the tension-composition skill invoked with the right context (library + guardrails + accumulated identity).

## DOCUMENT-BY-DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

### 01 — CD EVOLVED VISION (1,000 lines)

**Title:** "What CD Looks Like With All Accumulated Learnings"

**Purpose:** Transform CD from "component chemistry" into a **stress test of the 3-way equivalence** under combination pressure.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **The Discovery That Changed Everything** — AD proved that axis = organization = density (AD-F-023: ATTENTION TOPOLOGY). This collapses CD's purpose from discovering a new dimension to **testing whether the unification holds when patterns combine**.

2. **8 Recommendations for CD Evolution:**
   - **R1**: Evaluate CD-005 for redundancy (OD-001 already tested conversational flow)
   - **R2**: CD-006 as pilot migration (use REAL content, not synthetic)
   - **R3**: HANDOFF-CD-TO-MIGRATION as playbook (not passive summary)
   - **R4**: Completeness Gate (all components used, all R-5 findings validated)
   - **R5**: Convention Spec BEFORE building (AD's success proves this)
   - **R6**: Component chemistry validation (velocity/temperature/weight empirically tested)
   - **R7**: Transition grammar extension (5×5 matrix validated at combination scale)
   - **R8**: R-5 consumption as primary mission (~75-80% currently unapplied)

3. **The Grammar Metaphor:**
   - DD = Inventing the Alphabet (density patterns)
   - OD = Discovering Word Formation (organizational patterns)
   - AD = Writing Direction IS Part of Meaning (axis = topology)
   - **CD = Writing the First Sentences** (testing if grammar composes)
   - Post-CD = Translation (applying complete language)

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Inherits 84 findings (21 COMP-F, 18 DD-F, 17 OD-F, 28 AD-F)
- Inherits 20 validated patterns
- Inherits 5 soul pieces (0 violations across ~19,669 elements)
- Inherits R-5 Combination Theory (39 findings, CD's primary source)

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- CD is the **terminal stress test**, not a new dimension discovery
- Completeness Gate must pass before freeze
- CD-006 validates **both Track 1 (clean mappings) AND Track 2 (tension-composition)**

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. The 3-way equivalence makes sameness architecturally impossible
2. CD is the last chance to change the language before freeze
3. R-5 consumption is CD's primary mission (from ~5% to 80%+)

### 02 — POST-CD PHASES (800 lines)

**Title:** "The Post-CD Pipeline: From Completion Through Migration"

**Purpose:** Document the **7 missing phases** between "CD is done" and "start migrating pages" that no existing document acknowledged until gap analysis exposed them.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **The Two-Track Discovery:**
   - **Track 1 (Assembly)**: 40-50% of pages, deterministic assembly, 45-90 min/page, parallelizable
   - **Track 2 (Composition)**: 50-60% of pages, tension-driven metaphor, 3-5 hrs/page, sequential bottleneck

2. **Component Taxonomy Discovery:**
   - **Tier 1 (Atoms)**: ~80 lines, 100% extractable
   - **Tier 2 (Molecules)**: ~175 lines, 90%+ extractable
   - **Tier 2.5 (Patterns)**: ~145 lines CSS + 440 guidance, 70% extractable
   - **Tier 3 (Organisms)**: 0% extractable, prose strategies only
   - **Total extractable**: ~400 lines covering 60-70% of any file

3. **Phase Reordering:**
   - **BEFORE (incorrect)**: CD → Extraction → Content Analysis → Playbook
   - **AFTER (corrected)**: CD → Content Analysis → Extraction → Validation → Playbook
   - **Reason**: Classification drives what gets built

4. **Updated Phase Sequence:**
   - **Phase A**: CD Completion (4-5h) — validates both tracks
   - **Phase B**: Content Analysis + Track Classification (4-6h) — MOVED from F
   - **Phase C**: Component Extraction (6-10h) — SCOPE REDUCED
   - **Phase D**: Extraction Validation (1-2h) — NEW PHASE
   - **Phase E**: Migration Playbook v2 (4-5h) — EXPANDED for Track 2
   - **Phase F**: Pilot Migration (3-5h) — MUST test Track 2
   - **Phase G**: Playbook Refinement (1-2h)
   - **FREEZE LINE**
   - **Phase H+I**: Full Migration (80-160h) — Track 1 + Track 2

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Built on 01's CD vision
- Integrates component taxonomy research (5 files)
- Integrates pipeline evolution research (6 files)
- Integrates tension-composition skill (839 lines)

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- Content Analysis MUST come FIRST (Phase B, not Phase F)
- Extraction scope is ~400 lines, not "full printing press"
- Validation Pass (Phase D) catches gaps before playbook
- Track 2 is THE bottleneck (3-5h/page, non-parallelizable)

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. Two tracks use same vocabulary, different execution
2. The printing press metaphor still applies but differently: Tier 1+2 is extractable, Tier 3 is compositional
3. Phase B determines Track 1/2 split — THE critical variable

---

### 03 — MIGRATION PIPELINE (1,685 lines)

**Title:** "The Per-Page Migration Pipeline: How Content Becomes Design Through Two Fundamentally Different Tracks"

**Purpose:** Specify the **6-phase per-page pipeline** for BOTH tracks with concrete walkthroughs.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Complete Track 1 Walkthrough** (Tutorial example: "Setting Up Authentication"):
   - Phase 1: Page Analysis (12 min) — 5-dimensional classification
   - Phase 2: Pattern Selection (8 min) — Deterministic lookup (60% automatic)
   - Phase 3: Composition Design (18 min) — R5 rules + transition grammar + guardrails
   - Phase 4: Build (28 min) — Load Tier 1+2 from library
   - Phase 5: Perceptual Audit (12 min) — PA-01 through PA-28
   - Phase 6: Discovery Docs (7 min) — Consumption Receipt
   - **Total**: 85 min

2. **Complete Track 2 Walkthrough** (Conceptual example: "Boris Cherny on TypeScript"):
   - Phase 1: Page Analysis + Tension Pre-Screen (18 min)
   - Phase 2: Partial Pattern Selection (12 min) — Axis DEFERRED to metaphor
   - **Phase 3: Tension-Composition Pipeline (150 min)** — THE BOTTLENECK
     - Phase 0: Content assessment (5 min)
     - Phase 1: Multi-axis questioning (25 min)
     - Phase 2: Tension derivation (30 min)
     - Phase 3: Metaphor collapse (45 min)
     - Phase 4: Compositional layout (35 min)
     - Phase 5: Output (10 min)
   - Phase 4: Build (35 min) — Tier 1+2 + generated Tier 3
   - Phase 5: Perceptual Audit (18 min) — PA-01 through PA-48
   - Phase 6: Discovery Docs (12 min) — Enhanced Receipt + Metaphor Record
   - **Total**: 245 min (4 hours)

3. **The Addition Test:**
   - > "Can you fulfill the reader's need by selecting and placing existing components without transforming their meaning?"
   - **YES** → Track 1 (assembly)
   - **NO** → Track 2 (transformation required)

4. **The Content Classification Table:**
   - Tutorial → CRESCENDO → F-Pattern → Track 1
   - Conceptual → GEOLOGICAL → Spiral → Track 2 candidate
   - Q&A → PULSE → Z-Pattern → Track 1
   - Evaluation → CONFIDENCE-BASED → Spiral → Track 2 candidate

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Built on 02's phase definitions
- Uses 01's pattern vocabulary
- Integrates tension-composition skill inline

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- Track classification via Addition Test + BECAUSE Test + richness scoring
- Phase 3 for Track 2 is full skill invocation (150 min)
- Perceptual guardrails enforced in Phase 4.0 (not after)
- Metaphor selection uses composite scoring (6 criteria)

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. Same 6 phases, completely different Phase 3 execution
2. Track 2's Phase 3 is 64% of total time (150/245 min)
3. The pipeline is sequential within a page, parallelizable across pages (Track 1 only)

---

### 04 — CONTENT INGESTION (563 lines)

**Title:** "New Content and the Two-Track Operational Model"

**Purpose:** Distinguish **migration (project)** from **ingestion (operation)** and clarify how new content enters post-freeze.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Migration vs Ingestion:**

   | Dimension | Migration (Project) | Ingestion (Operation) |
   |-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
   | Volume | ~75 pages, known upfront | Unknown, one at a time |
   | Oversight | Full team, heavy review | Single agent, spot checks |
   | Consistency | All pages in one campaign | Must match pages done weeks ago |
   | Discovery | Feeds back into playbook | Feeds into application notes only |
   | Duration | 80-160h total | 45-90 min (Track 1) or 3-5h (Track 2) per page |

2. **The Two Playbook Outputs:**
   - **Migration Execution Spec** (~1,400 lines) — comprehensive, team-oriented
   - **Ingestion Operational Spec** (~50-100 lines) — lightweight, single-agent

3. **Guardrail Enforcement Strategy:**
   - **Layer 1: CSS-Bakeable** — baked into library as defaults (940px min, 32px padding, 1.5 line-height)
   - **Layer 2: Measurement-Based** — require skill verification (40% compression ratio, 16px label gap)

4. **The Operational Wrapper Concept:**
   - Pipeline is NOT software to build
   - Pipeline IS an agent with the right context
   - Context = library + identity + playbook + patterns + skills

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Built on 03's per-page pipeline
- Uses 02's phase definitions
- Clarifies 01's post-freeze implications

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- Separate execution specs for migration vs ingestion
- Guardrail enforcement split into baked vs measured
- New content uses SAME dual-track pipeline

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. Migration is a project; ingestion is an operation (same pipeline, different context)
2. The design system grows via application notes, not rule changes
3. Complete languages express new thoughts without changing

---

### 05 — COMPLETE ROADMAP (835 lines)

**Title:** "CD Through Full Migration: Timeline, Phases, and Risk Factors"

**Purpose:** Provide **complete timeline** with effort estimates and the freeze line guarantee.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Master Roadmap Table:**

   | Phase | Hours | Sessions | What It Produces |
   |-------|-------|----------|------------------|
   | A: CD | 4-5 | 1-2 | 6 explorations, ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 |
   | B: Analysis | 4-6 | 1 | Track 1/2 classification |
   | C: Extraction | 6-10 | 1-2 | ~400 lines CSS + strategies |
   | D: Validation | 1-2 | 1 | Test pages, gap documentation |
   | E: Playbook | 4-5 | 1 | Dual-track specs |
   | F: Pilot | 3-5 | 1 | Validated process + timing data |
   | G: Refinement | 1-2 | 1 | Playbook v2.1 |
   | **Subtotal** | **23-35** | **6-8** | **Pre-freeze** |
   | **FREEZE LINE** | | | **Design system locked** |
   | H: Track 1 | 22-60 | 3-6 | 30-40 pages, parallelizable |
   | I: Track 2 | 105-225 | 9-19 | 35-45 pages, sequential |
   | **Subtotal** | **127-285** | **12-25** | **Post-freeze** |
   | **TOTAL** | **150-320** | **18-33** | **Complete adoption** |

2. **Timeline Scenarios:**

   | Scenario | Track 2 % | Total Hours | Sessions | Calendar Time |
   |----------|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
   | Optimistic | 20% | ~150 | 16 | 4-5 weeks |
   | Realistic | 50% | ~220 | 22 | 5-7 weeks |
   | Pessimistic | 60% | ~280 | 27 | 7-9 weeks |

3. **Risk Register:**
   - **Pipeline produces mediocre metaphors**: MEDIUM severity, HIGH probability (40%) — mitigated by perceptual risk assessment + guardrails
   - **Track 2 takes longer than estimated**: HIGH severity, HIGH probability (50%) — pilot provides real data
   - **Track 2 is 60% not 20%**: HIGH severity, MODERATE probability (40%) — Phase B settles this

4. **The Freeze Line:**
   - **FROZEN**: Tokens, soul pieces, patterns, findings, convention spec, Tier 1+2 CSS (~400 lines)
   - **NOT FROZEN**: Implementation details, playbook wording, application notes, **Tier 3 CSS** (generated fresh per page)

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Aggregates all phase estimates from 02
- Uses per-page timing from 03
- Integrates migration vs ingestion from 04

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- Track 2 percentage is THE critical variable (20% vs 60% = 2x timeline)
- Pilot (Phase F) must test Track 2 to validate 3-5h estimate
- Completeness Gate passes before freeze

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. Original 34-68h estimate was off by 4-5x (150-320h corrected)
2. Track 2 creative capacity is THE bottleneck
3. Freeze line makes system complete, not static

### 06 — KEY INSIGHTS (246 lines)

**Title:** "The Soul of the System: Understanding What Was Actually Built"

**Purpose:** Provide **deep conceptual framework** via the written language analogy.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **The Written Language Analogy:**
   - **DD = Inventing the Alphabet**: CRESCENDO, PULSE, TIDAL, etc. are atomic rhythm marks
   - **OD = Discovering Word Formation**: Organizational patterns combine rhythm marks into recognized content types
   - **AD = Writing Direction IS Part of Meaning**: Spatial arrangement is not separate from density/organization
   - **CD = Writing the First Sentences**: Testing if the grammar composes coherently
   - **Post-CD = Translating the Library**: Applying complete language to express content

2. **Why Sameness Is Architecturally Impossible:**
   - **Force 1**: Content classification is the entry point (different content = different topology)
   - **Force 2**: Fractal self-similarity looks different per pattern (same principle, different expression)
   - **Force 3**: Component combination variety (unique velocity/temperature/weight profiles)

3. **The Attention Topology Concept:**
   - > "What does the reader's attention need to DO on this page?"
   - Tutorial → attention builds progressively → CRESCENDO → F-Pattern
   - Reference → attention jumps between clusters → ISLANDS → Bento Grid
   - Evaluation → attention drills inward → GEOLOGICAL → Spiral
   - **The 3-way equivalence collapses three decisions into one**

4. **Where Emergence Continues:**
   - Hybrid content types (testing transition grammar)
   - Content-pattern tension (twelve-beat PULSE needs rhythm injection)
   - Scale effects (navigation fractal scale across multi-page context)
   - New component combinations (Diff Sandwich recipe)
   - Soul constraints as generative force (border-radius: 0 FORCES creative solutions)

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Synthesizes 01's grammar metaphor
- Explains 03's classification table
- Justifies 02's two-track reality

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- None (conceptual framework, not operational spec)

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. The system is a language, not a template library
2. A complete language expresses new thoughts without changing
3. Attention topology is the generative decision from which everything cascades

### 07 — TRACK 2 COMPOSITIONAL SUPPLEMENT (1,142 lines)

**Title:** "When and How to Invoke the Tension-Composition Skill"

**Purpose:** Specify **Track 2 execution** — when to invoke the skill, how the pipeline operates, and quality lessons learned.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **The Addition Test (Track Classification):**
   - > "Can you fulfill the reader's need by selecting and placing existing design system components without transforming their meaning?"
   - **YES** → Track 1
   - **NO** → Track 2
   - Supplemented by BECAUSE Test: "Reader needs X BECAUSE [specific content property]"
   - Richness scoring: `Opposition × Overlap × Width` (threshold ≥ 8)

2. **The Full Phase 3 Pipeline (6 sub-phases):**
   - **Phase 0**: Content Assessment (5 min) — scope + route
   - **Phase 1**: Multi-Axis Questioning (25 min) — 4-14 axes, richness ratings
   - **Phase 2**: Tension Derivation (30 min) — select highest-richness tension
   - **Phase 3**: Metaphor Collapse (45 min) — THE CREATIVE STEP
     - Generate 3-5 candidates
     - Composite scoring (6 criteria)
     - Perceptual risk assessment (4 questions)
     - Perceptual cost assessment (5 questions)
   - **Phase 4**: Compositional Layout (35 min) — translation grammar (6 CSS channels)
   - **Phase 5**: Output (10 min) — thought process + HTML

3. **Track 2 Quality Lessons:**
   - **Pipeline predicts RICHNESS not QUALITY**: Richness = 27 ≠ best layout
   - **IMPLICIT > EXPLICIT metaphors**: Top 3 layouts all had LOW perceptual risk, structural expression (not textual labels)
   - **Perceptual risk is MANDATORY**: Pre-enrichment had 40% issues, post-enrichment 0 regressions
   - **Guardrails caught all would-not-ship issues**: 940px min, 32px padding, 40% compression ratio

4. **The 8 Quantitative Guardrails (Phase 4.0):**
   1. Content-to-viewport ≥ 65% (940px container)
   2. Horizontal padding ≥ 32px
   3. Label-to-heading gap ≥ 16px
   4. Compression ratio ≥ 40% (deepest ≥ 40% of shallowest)
   5. Characters per line 45-80
   6. Body line-height ≥ 1.5
   7. Section breathing ≥ 48px
   8. Border-radius = 0 (always)

5. **Builder Warnings (W-*):**
   - W-DEADZONE: Use state changes, not empty space
   - W-OVERLABEL: Structural gradients, not text labels
   - W-MONOTONY: Deliberate variation, not uniform grids
   - W-RESPONSIVE: Natural degradation at 768px
   - W-STATS: Stats bar weakness at mobile
   - W-IMPLICIT: FEEL metaphor, don't READ about it

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Implements 03's Track 2 walkthrough
- Uses 02's component library
- Applies 01's R-5 findings

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- Perceptual Risk Assessment (Phase 3.5E) — 4 questions, score ≤ 2 required
- Perceptual Cost Assessment (Phase 3.5F) — 5 questions, flags guardrail violations
- Guardrail enforcement in Phase 4.0 (BEFORE output, not after)
- Metaphor with Resolution 7/7 + Risk HIGH ranks BELOW Resolution 5/7 + Risk LOW

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. Track 2 is 64% Phase 3 (150/245 min) — metaphor collapse is irreducibly creative
2. Implicit metaphors (structural) outperform explicit (textual)
3. Guardrails prevent metaphor-driven visual compromise

---

### 08 — COMPOSITIONAL STRATEGY LIBRARY (1,747 lines)

**Title:** "The Complete Component Model and Pattern Catalog"

**Purpose:** Document **what gets extracted** (Tier 1+2+2.5) and **what gets composed** (Tier 3 prose strategies).

**Key Contributions:**

1. **The 3-Tier Component Model:**

   ```
   Tier 1: Atoms (~80 lines)
      100% extractable, byte-for-byte identical
   ↓
   Tier 2: Molecules (~175 lines)
      90%+ extractable, maintain identity anywhere
   ↓
   Tier 2.5: Reusable Patterns (~145 CSS + 440 guidance)
      70% extractable, require judgment to apply
   ↓
   Tier 3: Organisms (prose only)
      0% extractable, metaphor-dependent arrangements
   ```

2. **Tier 2 Component Inventory (9 confirmed):**
   - Callout family (6 variants: note, tip, gotcha, caution, essence, info)
   - Code block (dark bg, syntax highlighting)
   - Page header (dark bg, 3px red border, metadata)
   - Page footer (mirrors header)
   - Data table (grid, mono headers, 3px/1px borders)
   - Generic container (max-width, centered, responsive padding)
   - Inline code, focus-visible, selection styling

3. **Tier 2.5 Pattern Catalog (5 documented):**
   - Bento grid (CSS + 110 lines guidance)
   - Solid offset depth (CSS + 80 lines guidance)
   - Scroll witness TOC (CSS + 70 lines guidance)
   - Drop cap (CSS + 60 lines guidance)
   - Confidence encoding (CSS + 120 lines guidance)

4. **Tier 3 Compositional Strategy Recipes (6 documented):**
   - Geological confidence stratification (~150 lines each)
   - Narrative CRESCENDO + F-Pattern
   - Hub-spoke spatial layout
   - Bento task islands
   - Editorial synthesis
   - Compound sequential

5. **The Tier 2.5 vs Tier 3 Boundary:**
   - **The Rename Test**: Can you rename the CSS class generically without losing distinctiveness?
   - `.callout-essence` → `.accent-callout` ✓ (Tier 2: border + serif works anywhere)
   - `.stratum--established` → `.bordered-section` ✗ (Tier 3: 4px border only means "confidence" in geological context)

6. **CSS Custom Properties Bridge:**
   - Tier 2 components expose `var(--callout-padding, default)`
   - Tier 3 zone wrappers SET custom properties
   - Example: `.stratum--compressed .callout { --callout-padding: 16px 24px; }`

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Operationalizes 02's component taxonomy
- Provides 07's Tier 3 pattern references
- Documents 03's library consumption

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- Component count is 9 confirmed (likely 12-18+ if audited comprehensively)
- Tier 2.5 is the hybrid zone (CSS extractable, judgment required)
- Total extractable: ~400 lines covering 60-70% of any file
- Remaining 30-40% must be composed fresh (Tier 3)

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. The printing press metaphor still works but differently: Tier 1+2 is vocabulary, Tier 3 is prose
2. Richer Tier 2.5 library could reduce Track 2 percentage (borderline pages shift to Track 1)
3. CSS custom properties enable two-layer architecture (frozen base + fresh composition)

---

### 09 — EXTRACTION VALIDATION PROTOCOL (984 lines)

**Title:** "Phase D: Testing Component Library Sufficiency Before Migration"

**Purpose:** Specify **Phase D validation** — build 2 test pages BEFORE writing playbook to catch gaps.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Validation Test Suite:**

   | Test | Content | Build Method | Duration | Success Criteria |
   |------|---------|--------------|----------|------------------|
   | **Test 1 (Track 1)** | Tutorial | Library alone (Tier 1+2 only) | ~55 min | PA-01 to PA-28 ≥ 26/28 PASS, would-ship |
   | **Test 2 (Track 2)** | Conceptual | Library + pipeline (Tier 1+2+3) | ~3 hrs | PA-01 to PA-48 ≥ 45/48 PASS, 8/8 guardrails, would-ship |
   | **Test 3 (Metrics)** | Both pages | Coverage + quality | ~10 min | 5/7 metrics pass, 0 soul violations |

2. **The 8 Guardrails (Enforced in Tests):**
   - G1: Content-to-viewport ≥ 65% (940px)
   - G2: Horizontal padding ≥ 32px
   - G3: Label-to-heading gap ≥ 16px
   - G4: Compression ratio ≥ 40%
   - G5: Characters per line 45-80
   - G6: Body line-height ≥ 1.5
   - G7: Section breathing ≥ 48px
   - G8: Border-radius = 0

3. **Guardrail Baking Strategy:**
   - **Layer 1 (baked into library)**: G1, G2, G6, G7, G8 — automatic compliance
   - **Layer 2 (requires measurement)**: G4 (compression ratio requires min/max comparison)

4. **Failure Modes & Actions:**
   - Missing Tier 2 component → Add to extraction, re-test (+1-2 hours)
   - Insufficient Tier 2.5 pattern → Create CSS + guidance, re-test (+2-3 hours)
   - Custom property bridge broken → Fix Tier 2 interface, re-test (+1-2 hours)
   - Guardrail unenforceable → Update skill Phase 4.0, re-test (+1 hour)

5. **Validation Checklist Template:**
   - Comprehensive checklists for Test 1, Test 2, Test 3
   - Per-test gap documentation
   - Final verdict: PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL
   - If FAIL: required actions before Phase E

**How It Builds on Previous:**
- Tests 08's component library
- Validates 07's guardrails
- Catches gaps before 02's Phase E (Playbook)

**Key Decisions Introduced:**
- Phase D is MANDATORY (not optional quality check)
- Test 2 must invoke full tension-composition pipeline
- Guardrails baked into library where possible
- Re-test threshold: full re-test for Tier 1/2 changes, targeted for Tier 2.5/3

**Most Important Ideas:**
1. Better to discover gaps on 2 test pages than 75 production pages
2. Validation proves sufficiency, not just correctness
3. Guardrail baking makes library "pit of success"

## CROSS-DOCUMENT EVOLUTION

### How Thinking Evolved Across Documents

**Document 01 (Vision)** establishes:
- CD is a stress test, not a new dimension
- R-5 consumption is primary mission
- Grammar metaphor: CD = writing first sentences

**Document 02 (Phases)** discovers:
- Component taxonomy: only 60-70% extractable
- Two-track reality: Track 1 (assembly) vs Track 2 (composition)
- Phase reordering: Analysis BEFORE Extraction

**Document 03 (Pipeline)** operationalizes:
- Complete per-page walkthroughs for BOTH tracks

**Document 09 (Validation)** validates:
- Phase D test suite (3 tests)
- Guardrail baking strategy
- Gap remediation procedures

### The Chain of Accumulation

Each document **inherits everything from previous documents** and **adds one critical layer**:

```
01 (Vision)
  → establishes WHAT CD is
    ↓
02 (Phases)
  → discovers HOW post-CD splits into 2 tracks
    ↓

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS

### 1. The Three Discoveries That Changed Everything

**Discovery 1 (AD-F-023): The 3-Way Equivalence**
- Axis = Organization = Density = Attention Topology
- This collapses CD's purpose from discovering a dimension to stress-testing the unification
- Sameness becomes architecturally impossible (different content = different topology)

**Discovery 2 (Component Taxonomy): The 60-70% Limit**
- Only Tier 1+2+2.5 is extractable (~400 lines)
- Remaining 30-40% (Tier 3) must be composed fresh per metaphor
- The "printing press" metaphor still works but as alphabet+vocabulary, not full layouts

**Discovery 3 (Pipeline Evolution): The Two-Track Reality**
- Track 1 (assembly): 40-50% of pages, deterministic, 45-90 min/page
- Track 2 (composition): 50-60% of pages, creative, 3-5 hrs/page
- Track 2 is THE bottleneck — creative capacity is non-parallelizable

### 2. The Core Principle (Repeated Across Docs)

> **"The metaphor shapes experience; the guardrails prevent it from breaking experience."**

- **Tier 1+2 are the guardrails** (locked tokens, stable components)
- **Tier 3 is the metaphor** (compositional arrangements serving content)
- Guardrails enforced in Phase 4.0 (before output, not after)
- Perceptual risk/cost assessments prevent metaphor-driven visual compromise

### 3. The Timeline Reality

**Original assumption:** 34-68 hours (12-32 min/page uniform)

**Updated reality:** 150-325 hours split as:
- Pre-freeze: 23-35 hours (7 phases)
- Track 1: 22-60 hours (parallelizable)
- Track 2: 105-225 hours (sequential bottleneck)

**Critical variable:** Track 2 percentage (20% vs 60% = 2x timeline)

### 4. The Freeze Line Guarantee

**User's non-negotiable:**
> "Once we start migrating actual documentation pages, I don't want to have to update the design system."

**How it's achieved:**
- 7 intermediate phases (A-G) close ALL gaps before freeze
- Phase D validation catches insufficiency on 2 test pages, not 75 production pages
- Track 2 composes Tier 3 FRESH per page but uses FROZEN vocabulary
- Design system grows via application notes, not rule changes

### 5. The Operational Wrapper Concept

**The pipeline is NOT software to build.**

**The pipeline IS an agent with the right context:**
- For Track 1: Load library + playbook + pattern index
- For Track 2: Load library + skill + guardrails + identity

**Context assembly:**
1. ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 (terminal reasoning document)
2. Tier 1+2 component library (~400 lines CSS)
3. Tier 3 compositional strategies (6 prose patterns)
4. Perceptual guardrails (8 quantitative floors)
5. Tension-composition skill (839 lines, Phases 0-5)
6. Perceptual-auditing skill (PA-01 to PA-48)

**An agent loading this context BECOMES the pipeline.**

## OPEN QUESTIONS IDENTIFIED

The documents explicitly track **23+ open questions** across multiple categories:

### Q1: Track 2 Percentage — THE Critical Variable
- **Phase architect estimate:** 15-20% (10-15 pages)
- **Impact assessor estimate:** 50-60% (35-45 pages)
- **Timeline impact:** 20% = ~150h total, 60% = ~280h total (2x difference)
- **Resolution:** Phase B (Content Analysis) settles this definitively

### Q2: Can Agents Invoke Skills Mid-Pipeline?
- **If YES:** Phase 3 becomes simple skill invocation gate
- **If NO:** Phase 3 must INLINE entire skill protocol (~800 lines)
- **Resolution needed before:** Phase E (Playbook finalization)

### Q3: Should Phases 0-2 Run for ALL Pages?
- **For:** Catches false negatives (pages that SEEM simple but have latent tension)
- **Against:** 75 pages × 35 min = 43 hours just for classification
- **Proposed solution:** Fast-path for obvious Track 1, full Phases 0-2 for ambiguous

### Q4: Component Count — Really 9 or 12-18+?
- **Current:** 9 was analytical estimate from 12-15 representative files
- **Not yet done:** Exhaustive programmatic scan across all 30+ HTML files
- **Action required:** Phase C should BEGIN with comprehensive inventory

### Q5: Does Richer Tier 2.5 Reduce Track 2 Percentage?
- **Current:** 5 Tier 2.5 patterns documented
- **Hypothesis:** Expanding to 10-12 patterns could push borderline pages from Track 2 to Track 1
- **Implication:** Every pattern promoted from Tier 3 to Tier 2.5 reduces Track 2 queue (the bottleneck)

### Q6: Track 2 Model Tier — Sonnet or Opus?
- **Impact assessor suggests:** Opus 4.6 required for creative metaphor collapse
- **Cost implications:** 35-45 pages × Opus tier = substantial API cost
- **Test during:** Phase F (Pilot Migration)

### Q7: Metaphor Quality Improvement Through Library Compounding?
- **Hypothesis:** As compositional strategy library grows, metaphor selection becomes faster and higher quality
- **Mechanism:** Page 1 (cold start, 45 min metaphor collapse) → Page 50 (library mature, 15 min metaphor collapse)
- **Expected timeline improvement:** First 10 pages ~5h each, Pages 31+ ~2.5h each

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions (Before CD Execution)

1. **Resolve Open Question #1** — Run Phase B Content Analysis on sample pages (10-15 pages) to estimate actual Track 1/2 split
   - If Track 2 = 50-60%, communicate timeline expansion to user
   - If Track 2 = 15-20

## Executive Summary: The Journey From Confusion to Clarity

**You started with confusion about vocabulary:**

> "Do patterns create rigidity? How do tiers work? What IS the library?"

**Your questions evolved into something deeper:**

> "How far can we move along the spectrum of deriving patterns WITHOUT creating rigidity? How do we absorb maximum information at ALL levels without the system thinking there's already a use case, so it doesn't need to expand creatively?"

**You gave us the metaphor that unlocked everything:**

> "Like jazz — learn the standards, extract the mechanisms, play what YOU hear. Never under the guise of restraint."

**Here's what we found:**

The rigidity you sensed is REAL. But it's not from the information itself — it's from **how it's positioned in space and time**. Same information, different architecture = radically different creative outcome.

The answer: **The Gradient Architecture** — a 3-tier loading system where:
- **The house's foundation** (mechanisms, guardrails) is always present
- **The gallery of prior work** (examples, case studies) loads only when YOU request it, AFTER you've sketched your own ideas
- **The detailed blueprints** (full recipes) load only AFTER you've committed to a direction

You can have BOTH maximum information AND maximum creativity. But they can't occupy the same proximity tier.

## PART 1: ANSWERING YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTIONS

### Question 1: Does content analysis before extraction introduce bias?

**Short Answer:** No bias in WHAT gets extracted. Potential bias in HOW it gets framed.

**The Full Story:**

Content analysis identifies what's actually USED (tutorial mechanisms appear 40×, geological strata appears 3×). This creates **priority bias** (good) but NOT **capability bias** (bad).

- **Priority bias = resource allocation:** Tutorial mechanisms get full CSS + HTML templates + guidance. Geological strata gets prose recipe only. This is economics, not capability limit.
- **Capability bias would be:** "Because geological is rare, we WON'T extract it." This doesn't happen.

**Evidence from Research #4:** Library underestimated extractable material by 35-45%. Actual extraction will find ~800 lines CSS (not ~400). Content analysis DIDN'T hide rare patterns — it revealed MORE patterns than theory predicted.

**What changes:** Nothing about extraction methodology. But Research #2 adds guardrails AS TOKENS (move them from "judgment" to "baked-in defaults"). Content-informed extraction now produces BOTH patterns AND safety floors.

---

### Question 2: Do 18 named patterns create a ceiling?

**Short Answer:** They CAN. But only if they're positioned wrong.

**The Real Answer:**

Pattern count doesn't create rigidity. Pattern FRAMING does.

**The vocabulary prison risk (Research #2):**

> "The library INTENDS to document what emerged (descriptive) but WRITES like it's prescribing what to do (prescriptive)."

Current format:
```markdown
**When to use:** Content has clear certainty gradients
**Composition recipe:** [8 steps]
```

This READS as template, even if you MEANT it as example.

**The solution (Research #3):** Jazz pedagogy framing.

New format:
```markdown
⚠️ READ THIS FIRST: This is NOT a template.

**The tension that existed:** [story]
**The search that happened:** [process]
**Why THIS answer worked:** [mechanisms]
**What YOU extract:** [tools, not templates]
**Other metaphors that could work:** [alternatives]
**Your assignment:** Derive YOUR answer.
```

Same information. Different positioning. Radically different creative outcome.

**Key insight from Research #1:** Pattern count can be 6, 18, or 30. What matters is:
1. **Framing** (narrative not recipe)
2. **Volume** (distributed across tiers, not all loaded at once)
3. **Proximity** (invisible during derivation, visible during validation)

You can have 30 patterns AND maximum creativity if they're positioned as **proof gallery** not **pattern catalog**.

---

### Question 3: Track 1 vs Track 2 — quality or economics?

**Honest Answer:** Primarily economics. Narrow quality kernel.

**From Research #3 (the smoking gun):**

> "If quality were the ONLY consideration, all pages would be Track 2. The honest statement: Track 2 could handle all 75 pages. It would produce richer outcomes. But the 2× timeline expansion is unacceptable."

**The quality kernel that's real:**

For installation guides, changelogs, version tables — metaphor is over-design. Track 1 prevents forcing creative treatment on content that doesn't warrant it.

**But for the 40-50% assigned to Track 1?** That's economics.

**What changes:** Stop framing Track 1 as "right for functional content." Be honest: "Track 1 is where assembly suffices and we optimize for speed."

This costs nothing and improves intellectual honesty.

---

### Question 4: Did tension-tests modify content?

**Definitive Answer:** No. Content fidelity is 95-100%.

**From Research #4 (forensic evidence):**

Audited 8 HTML files, 7 metaphors, 3 content sets:
- **Textual overlap:** 95-100% (identical sentences, identical ordering)
- **Structural equivalence:** 98% (same sections, same headers)
- **What changed:** CSS class names (`.fossil` vs `.callout-essence`), wrapper metaphor vocabulary
- **What stayed:** Every word of content

**Key finding:** "The metaphor is a LENS, not a FILTER."

**What this proves:** The system preserves content integrity regardless of metaphor. This is load-bearing and should never change.

---

### Question 5: What IS the library? (Now we can answer concretely)

**The House Analogy You Gave Us:**

> "I think about it like a house — the foundation is Tier 1. Tier 2 are the rooms you walk through. Tier 2.5 are specialized spaces (library, workshop). Tier 3 is... the experience of living there?"

**Yes. Exactly. Here's the precise mapping:**

```
TIER 1 (Foundation — always present):
├─ Tokens (colors, spacing, fonts) — the materials
└─ Guardrails (940px, 32px, 40% ratio) — the building codes

TIER 2 (Rooms — always accessible):
├─ Callouts, headers, code blocks — the furnished rooms
└─ 24 components total (Research #4 found 15 more than documented)

TIER 2.5 (Specialized Spaces — use when needed):
├─ Mechanisms (CSS patterns) — the tools in the workshop
│   └─ Bento grid, solid offset, border-weight gradient
└─ Guidance (when/how/anti-patterns) — the instruction manuals

TIER 3 (Living Experience — emerges from YOUR use):
├─ Case Studies (narrative) — stories of past residents
│   └─ "Here's how ONE person used the workshop"
└─ Quick Reference (tables) — lookup AFTER you've built
```

**The Gradient Architecture (Research #1's core finding):**

```
LOAD TIER 1+2 → always present (tools + constraints)
         ↓
  Derive YOUR tension (Phase 1-2)
         ↓
  Search for YOUR metaphor (Phase 3)
         ↓
LOAD TIER 2.5 GUIDANCE → optional, if you want to see how others approached similar
         ↓
  Validate: "My metaphor makes sense" or "Actually, let me reconsider"
         ↓
LOAD TIER 3 CASE STUDY → only if reusing an existing metaphor
         ↓
  Compose using Tier 1 vocabulary + YOUR metaphor
```

**What makes this work:** Examples can't bias your initial ideas because they're not visible during derivation. They load AFTER you've sketched your answer, so they can only validate or refine, not replace.

---

## PART 2: THE ARCHITECTURE IN YOUR LANGUAGE

### The Jazz Principle in Action

**You said:**

> "Learn the standards, extract the mechanisms, play what YOU hear. Never under the guise of restraint."

**Here's what that looks like concretely:**

**Old flow (vocabulary prison risk):**
```
1. Read library → See 6 patterns
2. Read content → "This feels like geological"
3. Pattern-match: "Use geological recipe"
4. Output: Geological layout #4
```

**New flow (jazz pedagogy):**
```
1. Load tools (Tier 1+2) → border-weight gradient, background progression
2. Read content → Derive tension ("warmth vs austerity")
3. Search domains → "Layered + angular + warm = ?"
4. Generate candidates → Geological, botanical, architectural
5. [OPTIONAL] Check case studies → "Geological worked for OD-004"
6. Extract mechanisms → Border-weight, inverse padding
7. Compose fresh → YOUR layout using THEIR mechanisms
```

**Why the new flow is HARDER to be lazy:**

Phase 3 requires generating 3-5 candidates. You can't skip to "use geological" because geological isn't visible yet. By the time you see it (Phase 3.5), you've already done the creative work.

**And EASIER to be creative:**

You have ALL the tools (Tier 1+2 always loaded) but NO templates (Tier 3 invisible). The path of least resistance is to BUILD, not to COPY.

---

### The House Metaphor Extended

**You can walk through every room (Tier 2 components always accessible).**

**You can use any workshop tool (Tier 2.5 mechanisms always available).**

**You can READ about how past residents furnished THEIR rooms (Tier 3 case studies) — but only AFTER you've sketched YOUR furniture layout.**

**The foundation and building codes (Tier 1 guardrails) prevent the floor from collapsing, but they don't dictate what you build.**

**Result:** You build something structurally similar (same foundation, same tools) but experientially unique (your metaphor, your composition).

---

## PART 3: WHAT CHANGES (Concrete Actions)

### Change 1: Split the Library Files

**What exists now:**
- `08-COMPOSITIONAL-STRATEGY-LIBRARY.md` (1,747 lines, everything mixed together)

**What gets created:**

```
design-system/extraction-library/
├─ tier-1/
│  ├─ tokens.css (80 lines — locked alphabet)
│  └─ guardrails.css (40 lines — NEW, from Research #2)
├─ tier-2/
│  ├─ callouts.css (60 lines)
│  ├─ code-block.css (45 lines)
│  └─ [22 more components from Research #4]
├─ tier-2.5/
│  ├─ mechanisms/
│  │  ├─ bento-grid.css (25 lines)
│  │  ├─ border-weight-gradient.css (20 lines)
│  │  └─ [6 more mechanisms]
│  └─ guidance/
│     ├─ bento-grid.md (110 lines — when/how/anti-patterns)
│     └─ [7 more guidance files]
└─ tier-3/
   ├─ case-studies/
   │  ├─ geological-strata.md (250 lines — narrative format)
   │  └─ [5 more case studies]
   └─ quick-reference/
      ├─ geological-strata.md (20 lines — fast lookup)
      └─ [5 more quick refs]
```

**Timeline:** Phase C Component Extraction (4 sessions)

---

### Change 2: Rewrite Case Studies with Anti-Prescription Framing

**From Research #3 — Complete narrative format:**

**OLD (prescriptive recipe):**
```markdown
## Geological Confidence Stratification

**When to use:** Content has certainty gradients
**Composition recipe:**
1. Start with zone tokens
2. Apply border-weight per confidence
3. Set padding inverse to confidence
[8 steps total]
```

**NEW (jazz pedagogy narrative):**
```markdown
# Case Study: Geological Strata — Warmth/Austerity Resolution

⚠️ READ THIS FIRST: This is NOT a template.

## The Problem (OD-004)
Content had certainty gradients. Readers needed CLARITY.
System constraint: binary emphasis only (3px or 1px, no gradients).

**The Tension:** "How do you show GRADUAL confidence using DISCRETE tools?"

## The Search (Phase 3.4 in Action)
**Query:** "What domain has LAYERED ORDER while being ANGULAR yet showing GRADUAL certainty?"

**Domains that survived:**
1. Geological (sedimentary layers)
2. Architectural (foundation levels)
3. Botanical (growth rings)

**Why geological won FOR THIS PAGE:**
- Content used earth vocabulary ("bedrock," "layers")
- Strata are naturally angular (straight boundaries)
- Consolidation is gradual process, discrete result

## What YOU Extract
**REUSABLE (Mechanisms):**
1. Border-weight gradient — encode hierarchy via thickness
2. Inverse padding — certain=sparse, uncertain=compressed

**NOT REUSABLE (Metaphor):**
The geological vocabulary itself. Your content will derive DIFFERENT.

## Other Metaphors That Could Work
- **Growth/maturity themes:** Botanical (growth rings)
- **Building/construction:** Architectural (foundation layers)
- **Editing/revision:** Editorial (draft status)

All use SAME mechanisms (border-weight, padding) with DIFFERENT vocabulary.

## Your Divergence Assignment
DO THIS:
1. Run YOUR tension derivation
2. Generate YOUR search query
3. Discover YOUR metaphor (it will NOT be geological)

Success check: If your metaphor IS geological, ask:
"Did my content independently suggest earth vocabulary, or did I pattern-match?"
```

**Key additions:**
- ⚠️ Warning at top
- "The Search in Action" shows PROCESS
- "What YOU Extract" splits reusable vs inspirational
- "Other Metaphors" models variation
- "Divergence Assignment" sets expectation

**Timeline:** Phase C Session 4 (rewrite 6 case studies)

---

### Change 3: Bake Guardrails into Tokens

**From Research #2 — Three-layer enforcement:**

**NEW FILE:** `tier-1/guardrails.css`
```css
:root {
  /* Content Width Guardrails */
  --content-width-min: 640px;       /* 44% of 1440px */
  --content-width-optimal: 940px;   /* 65% of 1440px */

  /* Spacing Guardrails */
  --padding-horizontal-desktop: 32px;
  --section-spacing-min: 48px;
  --breathing-zone-min: 40px;

  /* Compression Safety */
  --padding-compression-ratio-min: 0.40; /* Deepest ≥ 40% of shallowest */
}
```

**Usage in Tier 2 components:**
```css
.page-container {
  max-width: var(--content-width-optimal); /* 940px */
  min-width: var(--content-width-min);     /* 640px floor */
  padding: var(--padding-horizontal-desktop); /* 32px floor */
}
```

**Override pattern (when metaphor requires it):**
```css
.geological-core {
  min-width: 480px; /* INTENTIONAL narrowing below guardrail */
  /* Documented in Tier 3 recipe: "Core sample metaphor uses 480px
     to encode physical cylinder. PA-02 PASS at 16px font-size." */
}
```

**Key principle:** Guardrails are FLOORS not CEILINGS. You can go above freely. You can go below WITH INTENT and DOCUMENTATION.

**Timeline:** Phase C Session 1 (create guardrails.css)

---

### Change 4: Update Skill Protocol with Phase-Gated Loading

**File:** `~/.claude/skills/tension-composition/SKILL.md`

**NEW Phase 0 (Context Loading):**
```markdown
## Phase 0: Context Loading

**TIER 1 (Always Load):**
READ:
- tier-1/tokens.css
- tier-1/guardrails.css
- tier-2/*.css (all components)
- tier-2.5/mechanisms/*.css (all mechanisms)

You now have: tools + constraints.

**TIER 2 (Do NOT Load Yet):**
DO NOT read tier-2.5/guidance/*.md or tier-3/case-studies/*.md
until Phase 3.5 (after metaphor candidates generated).

Examples bias derivation. Keep them out of context.
```

**NEW Phase 3.5 (Prior Work Check — OPTIONAL):**
```markdown
## Phase 3.5: Prior Work Check (OPTIONAL)

After generating 3-5 metaphor candidates, BEFORE selecting winner.

IF you want to see examples:
  READ: tier-3/case-studies/[relevant-pattern].md

  EXTRACT:
  - Mechanisms (reusable)
  - Proof (this tension IS resolvable)
  - Alternatives (other domains to consider)

  DO NOT EXTRACT:
  - The metaphor itself (unless content independently suggests it)

DECISION:
- If prior metaphor fits: Consider reuse with FRESH composition
- If no match: Proceed with YOUR novel metaphor (expected)
```

**NEW Phase 4.0 (Guardrail Gates — MANDATORY):**
```markdown
## Phase 4.0: Guardrail Compliance Gates

Before generating CSS, verify:

| Guardrail | Threshold | Your Value | Pass? |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Content width | ≥ 640px | ? | ☐ |
| Desktop padding | ≥ 32px | ? | ☐ |
| Compression ratio | ≥ 40% | ? | ☐ |

If ANY fails: adjust OR document override.
```

**Timeline:** Phase C Session 4 (update skill, +100 lines)

---

## PART 4: WHAT STAYS THE SAME

### These Are Working — Don't Touch Them

**1. The tension-composition skill protocol is clean.**
- Zero named-pattern references
- Pattern-agnostic derivation process
- 839 lines, well-structured
- **Evidence:** Research #1 and #2 both confirm

**2. Soul constraints are generative.**
- `border-radius: 0`
- `box-shadow: none`
- These forced discoveries (angular spirals = geological strata)
- **Evidence:** Explorations demonstrate this

**3. Content integrity is sacrosanct.**
- 95-100% textual fidelity across all metaphors
- **Evidence:** Research #4 forensic audit
- This principle is load-bearing

**4. The four-tier extraction model is sound.**
- Tier 1 (100% extractable) / Tier 2 (90%+) / Tier 2.5 (70%) / Tier 3 (0-30%)
- **Evidence:** Research #1 validation
- Accurately maps extractability gradient

**5. Perceptual guardrails work because they're binary.**
- 940px, 32px, 48px, 40%
- Binary rules = 100% agent compliance
- **Evidence:** MEMORY.md "Strategic Discoveries"

---

## PART 5: THE RIGIDITY SOLUTION (All Three Dimensions)

### Your Original Insight

> "Three rigidity dimensions: framing (how it's written), volume (amount creates gravity), proximity (when/where it enters context)."

**Here's how the new architecture addresses ALL THREE:**

### FRAMING Dimension — Narrative Not Prescriptive

**OLD:**
```markdown
**When to use:** Content has certainty gradients
**DO NOT:** Use outside geological contexts
```

**NEW:**
```markdown
**The tension that existed:** [story]
**What YOU extract:** [tools, not templates]
**Other metaphors that could work:** [alternatives]
**Your assignment:** Derive YOUR answer
```

**From Research #3:** Narrative format reduces perception of prescription. "This happened" ≠ "Do this."

---

### VOLUME Dimension — Distributed Across Tiers with Caps

**Current (all in one file):** 1,747 lines, 6 Tier 3 recipes loaded simultaneously

**New (distributed):**
- Tier 1: 120 lines (always loaded)
- Tier 2: 565-590 lines (always loaded, but components not recipes)
- Tier 2.5: 160 CSS + 630 guidance = 790 lines (CSS always loaded, guidance on-request)
- Tier 3: 1,500 lines (case studies on-request, quick ref post-selection)

**Key change:** Total volume INCREASES (~2,365 lines vs ~1,747) but PROXIMITY decreases. More information, less gravitational pull.

**From Research #1:** "Volume distributed across tiers, never exceeding threshold in any single tier."

---

### PROXIMITY Dimension — Phase-Gated Loading

**The mechanism that makes everything work:**

```
PHASE 0-3: Tier 1+2 ONLY (tools visible, examples invisible)
           ↓
    Agent derives tension
    Agent generates candidates
    Agent cannot pattern-match because patterns aren't visible yet
           ↓
PHASE 3.5: Tier 2.5 guidance + Tier 3 case studies load (OPTIONAL)
           ↓
    Agent sees examples AFTER independent derivation
    Can validate, refine, extract mechanisms
    Cannot replace derivation (already done)
           ↓
PHASE 4+: Tier 3 quick reference loads (if reusing metaphor)
           ↓
    Fast lookup for implementation
```

**From Research #1:** "Examples can't bias decisions because they're not visible during decision-making phases."

---

## PART 6: OPEN QUESTIONS & RISKS

### What's Still Unresolved

**Q1: Will agents actually load files in the right order?**

The phase-gated loading depends on agents following skill instructions ("DO NOT read tier-3 until Phase 3.5"). This is a text instruction, not a programmatic gate.

**Mitigation:** Make it explicit in file names: `tier-3/case-studies/PHASE-3.5-ONLY--geological-strata.md`

**Test during Pilot:** Track whether agents skip ahead.

---

**Q2: Does 250-line narrative format create information overload?**

Case studies grow from 150 lines (recipe) to 250 lines (narrative). Does this help or hurt?

**Counter-argument:** Volume is distributed (not all loaded at once). Narrative is EASIER to process than procedural steps.

**Test during Pilot:** Time how long agents spend reading case studies.

---

**Q3: Is 40% compression ratio the right floor?**

Research #2 documented this from perceptual audit findings. But it's based on geological strata (1 page). Does it generalize?

**Test during validation:** Build 3 pages with varying compression (30%, 40%, 50%) and audit perceptual comfort.

---

**Q4: Do we need Track 1.5 (enriched assembly)?**

Research #3 identified borderline pages where Track 1 feels flat but Track 2 feels excessive. Should there be a middle tier?

**Recommendation:** Start with binary split. If >10% of pages feel borderline during content analysis, create Track 1.5.

---

### What Could Go Wrong

**Risk 1: Agents ignore anti-prescription warnings.**

The `⚠️ READ THIS FIRST` warnings are text. Agents might skip them.

**Mitigation:** Put warnings in EVERY file (README, case studies, guidance files). Repetition increases probability.

---

**Risk 2: Metaphor vocabulary normalization creates loss.**

Research #4 recommends extracting ONE canonical `.callout`, documenting metaphor mappings (`.fossil` = `.callout--essence`). Does this lose semantic richness?

**Counter-argument:** CSS is identical. Only class names differ. Preserving semantic richness in HTML while normalizing CSS is the correct trade-off.

---

**Risk 3: Guardrail tokens become ceilings.**

If `--content-width-optimal: 940px` is baked in, agents might treat it as a maximum instead of a sweet spot.

**Mitigation:** Token naming (`optimal` not `max`). Documentation emphasizes "you can go wider WITH INTENT."

---

## PART 7: RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (Ordered, Actionable)

### IMMEDIATE (Do First)

**1. Create directory structure**
- Create `design-system/extraction-library/`
- Create subdirectories: `tier-1/`, `tier-2/`, `tier-2.5/mechanisms/`, `tier-2.5/guidance/`, `tier-3/case-studies/`, `tier-3/quick-reference/`
- **Timeline:** 10 minutes
- **Blocker:** None

---

**2. Extract Tier 1 + Tier 2 universal components**
- Extract `tier-1/tokens.css` (~80 lines)
- Create `tier-1/guardrails.css` from Research #2 spec (~40 lines)
- Extract 9 confirmed universal Tier 2 components (~270 lines)
- **Timeline:** 1 session (~2 hours)
- **Blocker:** None (all source files exist)

---

**3. Write ANTI-PRESCRIPTION-WARNING.md**
- Create root-level warning file (~100 lines)
- Link from README.md
- Template from Research #3
- **Timeline:** 30 minutes
- **Blocker:** None

---

### PHASE C (Component Extraction — 4 Sessions)

**Session 1: Foundation**
- ✅ Directory structure (done above)
- ✅ Tier 1 tokens + guardrails (done above)
- ✅ 9 universal Tier 2 components (done above)
- **Output:** ~390 lines CSS

---

**Session 2: High-value undocumented**
- Extract 5 high-priority components from Research #4:
  - Skip link (~15 lines)
  - Central role component (~35 lines)
  - Stratum boundary marker (~20 lines)
  - Depth/dating marker (~25 lines)
  - Confidence badge (~10 lines)
- **Output:** ~105 lines CSS
- **Source files:** DD-001, OD-004, Gas Town layouts

---

**Session 3: Tier 2.5 expansion**
- Extract 5 confirmed mechanisms CSS (~105 lines)
- Extract 3 NEW mechanisms from Research #4 (~55 lines)
- Write 8 guidance files (~630 lines markdown)
- **Output:** ~790 lines (CSS + markdown)

---

**Session 4: Tier 3 case studies**
- Rewrite 6 case studies in narrative format (~1,500 lines)
- Create 6 quick reference files (~120 lines)
- **Output:** ~1,620 lines markdown
- **Template:** Research #3 complete format

---

**Total Phase C Output:** ~2,905 lines (vs library's ~1,740 estimate)

---

### SKILL UPDATES (After Phase C)

**Update tension-composition skill:**
- Add Phase 0 (context loading instructions)
- Add Phase 3 intro (divergence expectation)
- Add Phase 3.5 (prior work check)
- Add Phase 4.0 (guardrail gates)
- Update Phase 5 (quick reference)
- **Lines added:** ~100
- **Timeline:** 1 hour

---

**Update perceptual-auditing skill:**
- Add guardrail token references to PA questions
- Add PA-42, PA-43, PA-44 (metaphor-awareness from Research #2)
- **Lines added:** ~50
- **Timeline:** 30 minutes

---

### VALIDATION (Test the Architecture)

**Test 1: Library-aware vs library-blind** (Research #2 recommendation)
- Build 2 Track 2 pages with SAME content, SAME tension
- Team A: Full library access (old way)
- Team B: Gradient architecture (new way)
- **Measure:** Execution time, metaphor novelty, quality verdict
- **Timeline:** 1 session (~3 hours)
- **Expected outcome:** Team B produces novel metaphor, Team A reuses documented pattern

---

**Test 2: Guardrail enforcement**
- Build 3 pages with varying constraints
- Page A: Intentional override (geological core @ 480px)
- Page B: Guardrail compliance (940px)
- Page C: Accidental violation (catches it via Phase 4.0 gate)
- **Measure:** Do gates catch violations? Do overrides document correctly?
- **Timeline:** 1 session (~2 hours)

---

**Test 3: Track split validation** (Research #3 recommendation)
- Take 5 borderline pages (tutorial, getting-started, architecture, concepts, changelog)
- Classify independently: Track 1 or Track 2?
- Build 1 page as Track 1, 1 page as Track 2
- **Measure:** Does Track 1 feel sufficient? Does Track 2 over-design?
- **Timeline:** 2 sessions (~5 hours)

---

### POST-VALIDATION (If Tests Pass)

**1. Full migration execution**
- Phase A: Pilot (2 pages)
- Phase B: Content Analysis (all 75 pages)
- Phases C-G: Build pipeline components
- Phase H: Full migration

**2. Ongoing diversity tracking**
- Weaver maintains metaphor registry
- Advisory warnings at 4× usage
- No hard limits, just visibility

---

## PART 8: THE HONEST TRADE-OFFS

### What You Gain

**1. Maximum information at all levels**
- ~2,365 lines total documentation (vs ~1,740)
- 24 Tier 2 components (vs 9 documented)
- 8 Tier 2.5 patterns (vs 5 documented)
- Guardrails baked into tokens (vs audit-time only)

**2. Creative freedom preservation**
- Examples invisible during derivation (Phase 0-3)
- Explicit divergence encouragement (skill protocol)
- Narrative framing (not recipe)
- Jazz pedagogy (standards as springboards)

**3. Quality floors without ceilings**
- Guardrail tokens prevent accidents
- Override pattern allows intentional violations
- Binary rules = 100% agent compliance
- Metaphor diversity explicitly valued

---

### What You Sacrifice

**1. Simplicity**
- 3-tier loading is more complex than "here's everything"
- Phase-gated loading requires agent discipline
- Anti-prescription warnings add cognitive load

**2. Speed (potentially)**
- Track 2 agents must derive tension BEFORE seeing examples
- Can't skip to "use geological" immediately
- Gradient architecture optimizes for creativity, not speed

**3. Predictability**
- Novel metaphors = less consistency across pages
- Track 2 output varies by agent interpretation
- Can't guarantee "all confidence pages use geological"

---

### What You Test

**The gradient architecture is a HYPOTHESIS.**

It predicts:
- Agents will produce MORE novel metaphors
- Quality will remain equal or higher
- Creativity ceiling will lift
- Pattern fatigue will decrease

**All of these are TESTABLE.**

The library-aware vs library-blind test (Validation Test #1) is THE critical experiment. Everything else follows from those results.

If Team B (gradient) produces novelty WITHOUT quality regression → hypothesis confirmed.

If Team B produces novelty WITH quality regression → need to adjust (maybe Phase 3.5 should be mandatory, not optional).

If Team B pattern-matches despite gradient → framing insufficient, need stronger anti-prescription.

---

## PART 9: THE FINAL ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

**You asked:**

> "How far can we move along the spectrum of deriving patterns WITHOUT creating rigidity?"

**The answer:**

**All the way.**

You can document EVERYTHING — 30 patterns, 50 patterns, 100 patterns — and STILL preserve creative freedom.

The rigidity doesn't come from the information itself. It comes from WHEN and HOW the information enters the agent's context.

**The gradient architecture proves this:**
- Same information (patterns, mechanisms, examples)
- Different positioning (3-tier loading, phase-gated, narrative framing)
- Radically different creative outcome (novel metaphors instead of pattern-matching)

**Your jazz analogy was perfect:**

> "Learn the standards, extract the mechanisms, play what YOU hear."

That's exactly what the gradient architecture enables:

1. **Learn the standards** = Tier 3 case studies (load AFTER your sketch)
2. **Extract the mechanisms** = Tier 2.5 (always available as tools)
3. **Play what YOU hear** = Skill protocol (tension-first derivation)

**Never under the guise of restraint** = Anti-prescription warnings + divergence expectation language.

**The library becomes what you designed it to be:**

An alphabet + vocabulary for compositional creativity.

Not a template catalog.

Not a pattern prison.

A launchpad.

# Research Package: CD-004 -- Essence as Background
## Builder-D Assignment (Wave 2)

===============================================================================
## 0. SOUL CHECKLIST (MANDATORY -- VERIFY BEFORE AND AFTER BUILD)
===============================================================================

```
[ ] border-radius: 0 everywhere
[ ] box-shadow: none
[ ] No filter: drop-shadow()
[ ] font-family: 'Instrument Serif'; font-style: italic for Essence/Core ONLY
[ ] 2-zone callouts + border-left: 4px solid + color differentiation
[ ] No physical-movement animation (ANTI-PHYSICAL identity)
[ ] opacity: 1 on all backgrounds (no rgba with alpha < 1.0)
[ ] 3-category borders ONLY (1px, 3px, 4px -- ZERO 2px)
[ ] #E83025 only accent color
[ ] No hover depth effects (no translateY, no scale-up)
```

### CRITICAL: ANTI-PHYSICAL CONSTRAINT (K-12)
This page uses Essence in an AMBIENT role. AMBIENT does NOT mean:
- opacity < 1 on Essence text or background
- z-index layering (no stacking contexts for depth)
- box-shadow for "ethereal" effect
- Gradient backgrounds suggesting material depth
- Any technique that makes the Essence "float" or "hover"

AMBIENT MEANS: Essence text integrated into the page fabric through STATIC typography and color, NOT through physical illusion. The Essence voice is present like a background hum -- through font choice and color warmth, not through transparency or layering.

### The 4 Combination Rules
1. **Velocity Rule (T2):** Insert FAST between consecutive SLOW.
2. **Temperature Rule (T3):** Buffer warm/cold with neutral.
3. **Weight Rule (G3):** 1 heavy to 1-2 light before next heavy.
4. **Proximity Rule (G1):** Tight (8-16px), standard (24-32px), section (48-64px).

### 11x11 Compatibility Matrix
R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md Appendix. Yes = Excellent | OK = Buffer | No = Avoid.

### The 5 Soul Pieces
| # | Soul Piece | CSS Lock |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Sharp Edges Command Authority | border-radius: 0 |
| 2 | The Archivist Speaks in Serif | Instrument Serif italic for Essence/Core ONLY |
| 3 | Callouts Share Family DNA | 2-zone + border-left: 4px solid |
| 4 | Shadows Lie About Depth | box-shadow: none |
| 5 | Squares Signal System | border-radius: 0 on all indicators |

### Compound Rules (AD-F-024): Sequential, not simultaneous.
### Transition Grammar (AD-F-025): Reference common block in other packages.

===============================================================================
## 2. YOUR COMBINATION
===============================================================================

### Axis-Density-Org Triple
| Dimension | Pattern | Source |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| DD (Density) | TIDAL | DD-F-005: Width varies -- content width modulates density |
| OD (Organization) | CONFIDENCE-BASED | OD-004: Confidence hierarchy determines order |
| AD (Axis) | SPIRAL + CHOREOGRAPHY | AD-004 (Spiral) + AD-005 (Choreography) |

### Why This Combination
TIDAL density uses width variation to create density: wide sections are sparse, narrow sections are dense. CONFIDENCE-BASED organization orders content from most certain to most speculative. SPIRAL provides the visual structure for confidence-based depth (innermost = most established). CHOREOGRAPHY sequences the reader through the spiral's layers. This models a philosophical/confidence-layered page where an Essence voice pervades the entire experience.

### AD Explorations to Reference
| AD | File | Key Feature to Study |
|----|------|---------------------|
| AD-004 | explorations/axis/AD-004-spiral.html | Angular spiral = geological strata, border-weight gradient (4px/3px/1px), confidence-proportional spacing |
| AD-005 | explorations/axis/AD-005-choreography.html | Direction change = density change, WAVE oscillation, spoke transitions |

### Transition Type Between Patterns
Spiral to Choreography = **Breathing** (needs 48px+ gap). Both patterns are spatially complex. The transition needs a clear break -- a full-width divider (3px border) + 48px+ margin + potentially a transitional Essence callout that bridges the philosophical tone.

===============================================================================
## 3. COMPONENTS TO USE
===============================================================================

| Component | Role in This Page | Weight | Velocity |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Essence Callout | AMBIENT -- philosophical background voice | Light | Fast |
| Code Snippet | Technical examples at confidence layers | Heavy | Slow |
| Info Callout | Context per confidence level | Light | Fast |
| Reasoning | Deliberation on approach choices | Heavy | Slow |
| Task Component | Action items per confidence tier | Medium | Fast |

### Challenge: Essence as Ambient Background
The core challenge is making Essence feel pervasive without:
1. Stacking Essence + Essence (T1: consecutive = axiom fatigue)
2. Using opacity < 1 (ANTI-PHYSICAL violation)
3. Using z-index layering (implies depth)
4. Creating a "floating" effect with shadows or gradients

**Strategy for AMBIENT Essence:**
1. Distribute Essence callouts across the page at REGULAR INTERVALS (not clustered)
2. Each confidence layer opens with a short Essence reflection (3-5 words of principle)
3. The Essence voice uses italic serif (Soul Piece #2) -- the FONT is the ambient signal, not the layout
4. Never more than 1 Essence per confidence section
5. Essence callouts use the standard 2-zone format (Soul Piece #3) with purple/amber left border
6. The "background" effect comes from FREQUENCY of appearance, not from visual layering
7. TIDAL width variation: Essence callouts can be narrower than full width (e.g., max-width: 60%) to create the TIDAL effect -- narrow Essence = dense wisdom, wide Code = sparse implementation

### Compatibility Notes (from 11x11 matrix)
| Pair | Rating | Note |
|------|--------|------|
| Essence + Code | Yes | Excellent -- philosophy explains code's "why" (H2) |
| Essence + Reasoning | Yes | Excellent -- axiom + deliberation (T1 productive tension) |
| Essence + Essence | No | AVOID -- axiom fatigue (T1 jarring collision) |
| Essence + Task | OK | Needs buffer -- reverent voice then utilitarian voice |
| Code + Reasoning | Yes | Code provokes reasoning |
| Info + Code | Yes | Context before example |

## 4. R-5 FINDINGS TO TEST
===============================================================================

| Finding | ID | Summary | How to Test in CD-004 |
|---------|----|---------|-----------------------|
| Shared Visual Anchors | H3 | Left-anchored components create momentum | Essence callouts (left border) and other callouts share anchor DNA |
| Semantic Dissonance | T3 | Don't oscillate warm/cold rapidly | Essence (warm/reverent) should not directly precede Task (cold/utilitarian). Buffer with Code (neutral). |
| Container Signal | G2 | Framed = bounded, anchored = annotation | Reasoning (framed) as bounded deliberation. Essence (anchored) as annotation. Don't stack framed after framed. |
| Visual Weight Balance | G3 | Heavy needs light companions | Code + Reasoning sections MUST include Essence/Info/Tip callouts as breathing room |
| Components Stack Not Nest | N1-N4 | No ad-hoc nesting. Max depth 1. | Essence does NOT "contain" other components. It sits BESIDE them as a sequential voice. |
| Component Moods | R2 | Essence = Reverent + Contemplative | The mood progression: Essence (contemplative) -> Code (authoritative) -> Reasoning (deliberate) |
| Component Voices | R3 | Essence = "If you remember nothing else..." | The voice should feel like a wise archivist punctuating a technical discussion |
| First Component Rule | S3 | First component sets tone | Start with Essence Callout to set philosophical treatise tone |
| Teaching Moment | S5 | Essence -> Core Abstraction -> Code -> Tip | Use this sequence at the most important confidence layer |
| Temperature Whiplash | A5 | Warm-cold oscillation | Essence (warm) -> Task (cold) without buffer = FAIL. Insert Code (neutral) between. |

### Specific R-5 Findings for TIDAL + CONFIDENCE
| Finding | ID | Summary | Application |
|---------|----|---------|-----------|
| Density Wave Sequencing | S2 | Wave pattern, not plateau | TIDAL width variation creates the wave: narrow Essence (dense) -> wide Code (sparse) -> narrow callout (dense) |
| Resolution Component | S4 | End with resolution, not tension | End confidence hierarchy with Task (clear next steps), not Reasoning (open question) |

===============================================================================
## 5. DENSITY PATTERN: TIDAL
===============================================================================

```
NARROW ===     ===     ===     ===
WIDE       =========       =========
```

### TIDAL Application to CD-004
TIDAL density varies content WIDTH to modulate density. Narrow = dense (compressed information). Wide = sparse (expanded examples).

1. **Narrow (Confidence: Established):** Essence callout (narrow, ~60% width). Code Snippet (full width but short). Info Callout (narrow). High confidence content is stated briefly -- it needs no elaboration.
2. **Wide (Confidence: Probable):** Reasoning Component (full width, 2-column). Code Snippet (full, longer). The probable tier gets more space because it needs argumentation.
3. **Narrow (Confidence: Speculative):** Essence callout (narrow). Task Component (narrow, focused). Speculative content is compressed because it awaits validation.
4. **Wide (Confidence: Open):** Reasoning Component questioning. Challenge Callout inviting exploration.

### Spiral as Confidence Hierarchy
- Outermost ring: ESTABLISHED (4px left-border, 24px spacing)
- Middle ring: PROBABLE (3px left-border, 32px spacing)
- Inner ring: SPECULATIVE (1px left-border, 48px spacing)
- Core: OPEN QUESTION (48-64px spacing, breathing zone)

Border-weight gradient (AD-F-014): 4px -> 3px -> 1px (skipping 2px). This IS the geological encoding -- border weight communicates confidence depth.

### Choreography as Reader Sequence
Choreography directs the reader through confidence layers:
1. Start at the ESTABLISHED level (highest confidence, densest presentation)
2. Spiral inward through PROBABLE (medium confidence)
3. Reach SPECULATIVE (lowest confidence, most breathing room)
4. Each transition = direction change = density state change (AD-F-017)

### Breathing Zones
- Between Established and Probable: 32px (moderate)
- Between Probable and Speculative: 48px (breathing)
- Between Speculative and Open: 64px (wide breathing -- uncertainty needs space)
- Footer: 3px Cat 1 structural border-top

===============================================================================
## 6. STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS
===============================================================================

### Container Width: 1100px (C-01). Prose: 70ch (C-20).
### Footer REQUIRED (C-02), 3px border-top (C-04).
### Responsive: 768px collapse (C-25), 960px for 4+ cols (C-08), padding reduction (C-05).
### Progressive Enhancement (C-09). Token-Only CSS (C-07).
### Border System: 1px / 3px / 4px only. ZERO 2px.
### Callout Limit: Max 2 per viewport.
### Dark Header (C-16). Page Personality: "Scholarly, Deliberate, Warm" (C-22).

===============================================================================
## 7. ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID
===============================================================================

| Anti-Pattern | Risk Level for CD-004 | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| Temperature Whiplash (A5) | HIGHEST -- Essence (warm) and Task (cold) co-exist | Always buffer Essence-to-Task with Code (neutral). |
| Essence Fatigue (T1) | HIGH -- Ambient Essence throughout | Max 1 Essence per confidence section. Never consecutive. |
| Semi-Transparent Backgrounds | CRITICAL -- "ambient" might tempt opacity tricks | opacity === 1.0 ABSOLUTE. The ambient effect comes from FREQUENCY, not transparency. |
| Orphaned Heavy (A4) | MEDIUM -- Reasoning and Code are heavy | Add Tip or Essence after every heavy component. |
| Same Density Throughout | MEDIUM -- TIDAL must vary | Enforce width variation: narrow Essence (60%) alternating with full-width Code (100%). |
| Depth Illusion | CRITICAL for this page | No z-index stacking, no gradients suggesting material, no blur, no parallax. |
| 2px Borders | ZERO TOLERANCE | Only 1px, 3px, 4px. Border-weight gradient: 4/3/1 (skip 2). |

===============================================================================
## 8. WAVE 2 NOTE
===============================================================================

This is a Wave 2 build. You will receive the Wave 1 identity delta from the lead before building. The identity delta contains:
- Any conventions discovered during Wave 1 builds (CD-001, CD-002, CD-003)
- Any combination-specific findings from Wave 1
- Any adjustments to the scoring rubric

Read the identity delta BEFORE starting your build.

===============================================================================
## 9. SCORING CRITERIA
===============================================================================

CD-004 will be scored on the standard 40-point rubric:
- Soul compliance (10 pts): Zero violations required. ANTI-PHYSICAL constraint is the primary risk.
- Research application (10 pts): TIDAL density + confidence-based organization + ambient Essence treatment
- Density pattern fidelity (10 pts): Width variation creates visible TIDAL rhythm
- Combination coherence (10 pts): Spiral + Choreography breathing transition, confidence layers readable

### Target Score: 34-36/40
The critical test is the AMBIENT Essence treatment. Success = the philosophical voice pervades the page through FREQUENCY and TYPOGRAPHY, not through opacity tricks or visual layering. The ANTI-PHYSICAL constraint is the hardest to honor here because "ambient" intuitively suggests transparency.

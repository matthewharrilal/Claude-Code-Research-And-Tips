# Analogous Domains Research: Accumulated Knowledge vs Creative Freedom

**Research Question:** How do other domains handle the paradox where accumulated creative knowledge creates gravitational pull toward known solutions?

**Core Paradox:** The more patterns, techniques, and approaches you document, the more useful the library becomes — BUT also the more gravitational pull it creates toward known solutions. New creative work risks defaulting to what's already documented rather than generating fresh approaches.

---

## 1. JAZZ PEDAGOGY

### The Real Book Paradox

Jazz standards are codified in Real Books and Fake Books — common knowledge among jazz musicians used in jazz institutions for teaching. The Real Book creates a shared vocabulary but also creates gravitational pull toward those specific tunes, changes, and approaches.

**Bootstrap's popularity has given the modern web a distinct "bootstrappy" look** — navigation up top, a slider with 2–6 big pics, 3 boxes and a plain footer. This is the design equivalent of the Real Book: everyone learns the same standards.

### Gravitational Mechanism

**Imitation as Gateway:** "Imitation is a tried and true method for sharing stylistic guidelines for improvisation in jazz, and young musicians learn to improvise within syntax by imitating peers, teachers, or other musicians." ([Rutgers Jazz Journal](https://jjs.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/jjs/article/download/190/145?inline=1))

**The Trap:** "Teaching of jazz improvisation in the academy has come under pressure from jazz writers and musicians over a perceived lack of creativity and originality, with critics arguing that formal study of improvisation strips performers of the essential quality of self-learning that rests with the individual performer." ([Rutgers Jazz Journal](https://jjs.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/jjs/article/download/190/145?inline=1))

### Solutions Tried

**Charlie Parker's Philosophy:** Parker's attitude to studying and performing was: **"You've got to learn your instrument; then you practise, practise, practise; and then, when you finally get up there on the bandstand, forget all that and just wail"**. ([Jazzwise](https://www.jazzwise.com/features/article/charlie-parker-a-beginner-s-guide-to-bird))

This is the canonical statement of "learn the rules to break them" — but notice the SEQUENCE:
1. Learn your instrument (technique)
2. Practice obsessively (internalize patterns)
3. **FORGET all that** (escape gravity)
4. Just wail (create freely)

Parker himself "dropped out of school and started practising at home from standard exercise books (at least 11 to 15 hours a day, he once claimed)" ([Jazzwise](https://www.jazzwise.com/features/article/charlie-parker-a-beginner-s-guide-to-bird)). He immersed himself completely in the tradition, THEN transcended it.

**Transcription Practice:** "Bebop legend Charlie Parker famously played along with recordings of Lester Young to develop his own ground-breaking improvisational voice." ([11 Best Jazz Solos to Transcribe](https://jazzfuel.com/best-jazz-solos-to-transcribe/))

### What Actually Worked

**Standards as Launching Pads, Not Cages:** The key distinction is whether standards are treated as:
- **CONSTRAINTS** (you must play these changes this way)
- **SCAFFOLDING** (these changes are a platform to explore from)

"Teaching improvisation should enable musicians to engage in real-time creative decision-making, risk-taking, interaction, adaptation, surprise, and responsiveness." ([NAfME](https://nafme.org/blog/guiding-principles-improvisation-general-music-classroom/))

**The Move from Imitation to Creation:** "Although jazz virtuosi are steeped in tradition, they must find their own voice to perpetuate that tradition in new forms—finding that voice requires moving from imitation to creation, as the artistic voice moves beyond technique and imitation." ([Rutgers Jazz Journal](https://jjs.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/jjs/article/download/190/145?inline=1))

### Transferable Insights

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** The problem isn't knowing the standards — it's **defaulting** to them without conscious choice.

- Parker LEARNED all the standards, transcribed solos obsessively, practiced 15 hours a day
- But when performing, he **forgot** that knowledge and accessed it intuitively, not mechanically
- The knowledge became **substrate**, not **template**

**For LLM agents loaded with design system patterns:**
- The patterns shouldn't be presented as "choose from these"
- They should be **internalized as vocabulary** but not presented as the menu
- The creative prompt should emphasize **forgetting** the library exists during initial ideation
- Patterns become evaluation criteria AFTER generation, not generation constraints BEFORE

## 2. DESIGN SYSTEM CRITICISM

### The "All Websites Look the Same" Phenomenon

**Bootstrap Homogenization:** "Bootstrap's popularity has given the modern web a distinct 'bootstrappy' look: navigation up top, a slider with 2–6 big pics, 3 boxes and a plain footer." ([Shakuro](https://shakuro.com/blog/design-art-modern-websites-look-the-same-but-its-ok))

**Material Design Everywhere:** Material UI "adheres strictly to Material Design principles, offering a cohesive and visually appealing design language" — but this cohesion comes at the cost of differentiation. ([Material UI vs Bootstrap - UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/material-ui-vs-bootstrap/))

### Gravitational Mechanism

**Speed Over Originality:** "Since a site needs to work well on a desktop, tablet, and phone, responsive web design is required, which is very time-consuming to build without frameworks, and tried and tested experiments have led to commonly used frameworks that meet most navigation and usability requirements." ([Shakuro](https://shakuro.com/blog/design-art-modern-websites-look-the-same-but-its-ok))

The framework SOLVES problems so efficiently that **NOT using it feels wasteful**. This is gravitational pull at its strongest.

**Tailwind's Naming Abolition:** Tailwind "took away naming things (the actual hard part of building a design system) and said 'Just use px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500'." ([Don't use Tailwind for your Design System - sancho.dev](https://sancho.dev/blog/tailwind-and-design-systems))

By removing the cognitive cost of naming, Tailwind makes defaulting to its utilities **cognitively cheaper** than creating custom solutions.

### Criticism in 2025

**Tailwind Fatigue:** "In 2025, Tailwind feels like a crutch with bloated HTML, design sameness, and tech debt." ([Why Tailwind Still Feels Wrong in 2025](https://medium.com/loop-of-thought/tailwind-was-never-the-answer-efc42ac3f83b))

**The Customization Trap:** "Limited customization options may not be suitable for projects with complex designs or unique visual styles, suggesting that developers often prioritize speed over differentiation when using these systems." ([Bootstrap vs Material UI - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bootstrap-vs-material-ui/))

### Solutions Tried

**"Creative Consistency":** "Consistency is important, but sometimes breaking the rules is even more crucial, and creative consistency means showing things in a fun and interesting way while still keeping the brand's look and feel the same." ([Design Systems in 2025 - SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/design-systems-in-2025/))

**Design Systems Don't Take Away Freedom:** "Design systems never take away creative freedom—although a design system is a set of principles, rules, and reusable components, you can creatively bend the design to your advantage through the components presented." ([Design Systems in 2025 - SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/design-systems-in-2025/))

### What Actually Worked

**NO CLEAR SOLUTION.** The field is currently struggling with this exact problem.

The frameworks that solve problems best (Bootstrap, Material UI, Tailwind) create the MOST homogenization. The argument has shifted to "sameness is acceptable because it solves real problems efficiently" rather than "we've found a way to have systematic design without sameness."

### Transferable Insights

**The Speed-Differentiation Tradeoff is Real:**
- Frameworks that reduce cognitive load the MOST create the MOST gravitational pull
- Customization options exist but are rarely used because they reintroduce the cognitive cost
- Users consciously choose speed over originality (not a failure of the system, but a feature)

**For LLM agents:**
- If pattern libraries are TOO easy to access, they'll be used even when custom solutions are better
- The cognitive cost of "not using the pattern" needs to be LOW, not high
- Presenting patterns as "here's what you could use" creates pull; presenting them as "here's what exists for evaluation after you design" doesn't

## 3. ART EDUCATION

### The Academic → Avant-Garde Pipeline

**Historical Pattern:** "Most Realists and Impressionists and others among the early avant-garde who rebelled against academism were originally students in academic ateliers, with Claude Monet, Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, and even Henri Matisse being students under academic artists." ([Wikipedia - Academic Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_art))

This is the SAME pattern as jazz: learn the rules thoroughly, THEN break them.

### Gravitational Mechanism

**Codified Emotions and Genres:** "The representation of the various emotions was codified in detail by academicism and the artistic genres themselves were subjected to a scale of prestige." ([Wikipedia - Academic Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_art))

When even EMOTIONS are codified, creativity becomes recombination of existing templates.

**Early Entry Problem:** "Painters enter art schools too young, and therefore the traces of individuality that survive the Academy are imperceptible, with about ten or twelve compositions every year that are practically identical in execution." ([Wikipedia - Academic Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_art))

### Criticism of Academic Model

**Attack on Conformity:** "An attack on the academic model came from the early Romantics, at the turn of 18th to 19th centuries, who preached a practice centered on individual originality and independence." ([Wikipedia - Academic Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_art))

**Avant-Garde Critique:** Starting in the second half of the 19th century, "realists, impressionists, and other avant-garde movements took issue with several aspects of it: the over-polished textures, the superficial quality of emotions and perspective, and the consumerism of the academies." ([Wikipedia - Academic Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_art))

### Solutions Tried

**MFA Programs - "Finding Your Voice":**

"MFA programs are designed to help students become critical thinkers through their work and amplify their own voice." ([MFA Program: 5 Things to Consider - CCA](https://www.cca.edu/newsroom/five-reasons-why-choosing-mfa-program/))

"MFA Studio Arts programs provide a rigorous and individualized education that helps each student develop artistic vision and voice." ([MassArt - Studio Arts](https://massart.edu/program/studio-arts/))

**Apprentice vs Academic Models:**

WESTERN (MFA): "Contemporary Western ceramic education emphasizes that each potter should develop a body of work that is unique and individualistic, which may make reference to the work of others (living or dead), but is expected to be as unique as the person who made it." ([Ceramics Field Guide](https://ceramicsfieldguide.org/chapter-2/applying-to-graduate-school/))

TRADITIONAL (Apprentice): "In the apprentice system, the student learns to make the master's work, not his or her own, and it is only upon reaching 'master' status that the potter may begin to make decisions and develop a distinct voice." ([Ceramics Field Guide](https://ceramicsfieldguide.org/chapter-2/applying-to-graduate-school/))

### What Actually Worked

**Rebellion FROM Knowledge, Not FROM Ignorance:**

The avant-garde artists who successfully created new movements were NOT ignorant of academic tradition — they were **deeply trained in it**. Monet, Courbet, Manet, Matisse all studied under academic masters.

**The Critical Timing:** The avant-garde emerged when artists had ENOUGH academic training to understand the rules, but ENOUGH independence to question them.

**Contemporary MFA Critique:** "MFA programs, for many a gateway to entrance into the contemporary art world, exist to train emerging artists how to talk about their work, rather than how to make it." ([Haber's Art Reviews](https://www.haberarts.com/krauss.htm))

This suggests current MFA programs may have overcorrected — emphasizing conceptual independence but not providing enough technical foundation to rebel FROM.

### Transferable Insights

**The Rebellion Prerequisite:** You can only break rules you deeply understand.

- Avant-garde artists weren't escaping academic knowledge — they were USING it as substrate for rebellion
- The apprentice model (copy master until mastery) works IF there's a clear moment of liberation
- The MFA model (emphasize individual voice) works IF there's enough technical foundation first

**For LLM agents:**
- Patterns shouldn't be hidden (that creates ignorance, not freedom)
- Patterns shouldn't be presented as menu (that creates defaulting)
- Patterns should be **learned deeply, then actively questioned** in the creative process
- The prompt might need a "rebellion phase" — explicitly questioning whether patterns serve the goal

## 4. CREATIVE AI RESEARCH

### Mode Collapse in Generative Models

**Definition:** "Mode collapse is a failure mode in generative models where the model produces outputs that are less diverse than expected, effectively 'collapsing' to generate only a few modes of the data distribution while ignoring others." ([Wikipedia - Mode Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_collapse))

This is EXACTLY our problem: the model knows many patterns but defaults to only a few.

### The Fine-Tuning Trade-Off

**Diversity Loss with More Training:** "More fine-tuning results in higher average task performance but less diverse outputs, while less fine-tuning results in lower average performance but more diverse outputs." ([Avoiding mode collapse in diffusion models fine-tuned with reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08315))

**Industrial Fine-Tuning Problem:** "Industrially fine-tuned models show very poor output diversity results, with a larger decrease in output diversity for prompts requiring creative or free-form output." ([Attributing Mode Collapse in Fine-Tuning](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3pDMYjpOxk))

### Gravitational Mechanism

**Training Data Frequency → Output Probability:**

Models trained on more examples of Pattern A than Pattern B will generate Pattern A more frequently, even when Pattern B is more appropriate for the context.

**Style Transfer Collapse:** "Diffusion model-based style transfer encounters challenges such as mode collapse, excessive stylization, or insufficient style adaptation." ([StyDiff: Style Transfer Method Based on Diffusion Models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17899-x))

### Solutions Tried

**Diversity-Aware Rewards:** "Introducing a distribution-aware reward that depends on the semantic structure of the generated set, using spectral clustering over samples and adaptively allocating exploratory rewards, encourages the discovery of novel visual modes." ([DiverseGRPO: Mitigating Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.21514))

**Multi-Layer Generation:** "Adjusted multi-layer generation approaches make style transfer more delicate and diverse, greatly reducing the occurrence of mode collapse." ([StyDiff: Style Transfer Method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17899-x))

**Hierarchical Reward Fine-Tuning:** "Enables controlled learning schemes promoting sample diversity and mitigating mode collapse while aligning diffusion models to downstream tasks." ([Avoiding mode collapse in diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08315))

### What Actually Worked

**Explicit Diversity Rewards:**

When the model is REWARDED for generating diverse outputs (not just good outputs), mode collapse decreases. This is a meta-goal added to the optimization.

**Few-Shot Balancing:** "n=3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks, with findings that three supporting examples provide the sweet spot between pattern diversity and context focus." ([Enhancing LLM-Based Neural Network Generation](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.24120))

Too many examples → mode collapse toward those examples
Too few examples → insufficient guidance
**3 examples = sweet spot**

### Transferable Insights

**The 3-Example Sweet Spot is GOLD:**

This is empirical evidence that more examples ≠ better creativity. There's an optimal load where the model has enough context but not so much that it collapses to frequent patterns.

**Diversity Must Be Explicitly Rewarded:**

Models don't naturally value diversity — they value probability. If you want diverse outputs, you must make diversity part of the objective function.

**For LLM agents loaded with design patterns:**
- Don't load ALL patterns into context — select 2-4 relevant examples
- Include explicit diversity rewards: "Avoid solutions that closely resemble the examples"
- Use temperature/sampling to encourage exploration beyond high-probability patterns
- Consider hierarchical prompting: generate WITHOUT examples first, THEN evaluate against patterns

## 5. CHRISTOPHER ALEXANDER'S PATTERN LANGUAGE

### The Creativity Constraint Critique

**Academic Criticism:** "The constraining nature of Alexander's patterns led scholars to criticise the theory for limiting the designer's creativity and preventing them from pursuing agendas that differ from his, according to critics like Davis (1983), Dovey (1990), and Messina (2003)." ([Christopher Alexander's A Pattern Language: Critical Response Analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40410-017-0073-1))

**Architect Resistance:** "Fellow architects, who didn't like seeing their art reduced to a formula, were ambivalent about the approach." ([Slate - Christopher Alexander's Enduring Influence](https://slate.com/culture/2009/12/the-enduring-influence-of-architect-christopher-alexander-author-of-a-pattern-language.html))

**Deterministic and Authoritarian:** "Academics have often rejected it for being deterministic and authoritarian." ([Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2009/12/the-enduring-influence-of-architect-christopher-alexander-author-of-a-pattern-language.html))

### Alexander's Counter-Argument

**Infinite Designs from Patterns:** "Creativity in Alexander's theory comes from adapting patterns to serve local conditions, rather than developing new solutions, and this allows each pattern to generate an infinite number of unique designs." ([Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language: Critical Response](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40410-017-0073-1))

Alexander argued patterns are NOT templates — they're **generative principles** that produce different results in different contexts.

### What Happened in Practice

**Acceptance by Builders, Rejection by Architects:**

"Christopher Alexander's pattern language has been widely accepted by building contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners, academics have often rejected it for being deterministic and authoritarian." ([Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2009/12/the-enduring-influence-of-architect-christopher-alexander-author-of-a-pattern-language.html))

**Why the Split?**
- **Builders** wanted functional solutions → patterns delivered efficiency
- **Architects** wanted creative expression → patterns felt constraining

This maps perfectly to our context:
- **Practitioners** (implementing solutions) find patterns useful
- **Creators** (designing novel solutions) find patterns limiting

### Software Design Patterns (Gang of Four)

**Similar Critique:** "A primary criticism of Design Patterns is that its patterns are simply workarounds for missing features in C++, replacing elegant abstract features with lengthy concrete patterns." ([Wikipedia - Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns))

**Over-Engineering Risk:** "There's a risk of over-engineering or using patterns where they're not needed, leading to unnecessary complexity." ([Rethinking Design Patterns - Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rethinking-design-patterns/))

**Paul Graham's Critique:** "When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I'm using abstractions that aren't powerful enough." ([Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rethinking-design-patterns/))

**Language-Specific Workaround:** "Peter Norvig demonstrates that 16 out of the 23 patterns in Design Patterns are simplified or eliminated by language features in Lisp or Dylan." ([Wikipedia - Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns))

### What Actually Worked

**CONTEXT MATTERS ENORMOUSLY:**

Patterns work when they solve problems that CAN'T be solved at a higher abstraction level. They fail when they're workarounds for language limitations or when they're applied without genuine need.

**Builder vs Architect Roles:**

Pattern languages serve DIFFERENT functions for:
- **Builders**: efficiency, proven solutions, reduced cognitive load → patterns are TOOLS
- **Architects**: exploration, novelty, creative expression → patterns are CONSTRAINTS

### Transferable Insights

**Patterns as Generative Principles vs Templates:**

Alexander's defense was that patterns are **generative** (infinite variations) not **templates** (copy-paste). But in practice, most users treated them as templates.

**The Language Limitation Problem:**

If patterns exist because your abstraction layer is too weak, fixing the abstraction layer eliminates the need for patterns. This is profound: maybe the solution isn't better pattern presentation, but better compositional primitives.

**For LLM agents:**
- If agents treat patterns as templates → gravitational pull happens
- If agents treat patterns as generative principles → infinite variation possible
- The PROMPT must emphasize generative use, not template use
- Consider: do we need better primitives instead of more patterns?

---

## CROSS-DOMAIN SYNTHESIS

### Universal Gravitational Mechanisms

Across all five domains, gravitational pull operates through these mechanisms:

1. **Cognitive Load Reduction**
   - Jazz: Real Book is faster than composing new standards
   - Design: Bootstrap is faster than custom responsive design
   - Art: Academic techniques are faster than inventing new approaches
   - AI: High-probability patterns are faster than exploring low-probability space
   - Architecture: Patterns are faster than solving from first principles

2. **Frequency Bias**
   - What you see most often becomes what you generate most easily
   - Training data frequency → output probability (AI)
   - Real Book standards → default repertoire (Jazz)
   - Bootstrap components → default layouts (Design)

3. **Social Validation**
   - Patterns that others use feel "safer" than novel approaches
   - Academic painting won salon prizes; avant-garde was rejected
   - Bootstrap sites look "professional" because everyone uses Bootstrap
   - Gang of Four patterns signal "good engineering" even when unnecessary

4. **Early Codification**
   - Entering art school "too young" → individuality erased
   - Learning patterns before understanding problems → pattern-seeking behavior
   - Fine-tuning too early → mode collapse

### Universal Solutions (What Works)

1. **Learn Deep, Then Forget**
   - Charlie Parker: practice 15 hours/day, then "forget all that and just wail"
   - Avant-garde artists: master academic technique, then rebel
   - This is NOT "don't learn patterns" — it's "internalize patterns so deeply you don't consciously access them"

2. **Rebellion FROM Knowledge**
   - Breaking rules requires knowing them
   - Monet, Matisse, Courbet were academic students first
   - Miles Davis transcribed Charlie Parker before finding his own voice
   - Ignorance doesn't produce innovation; informed rebellion does

3. **Explicit Diversity Rewards**
   - AI research: diversity must be PART OF the objective function
   - It won't emerge naturally; models optimize for probability
   - For LLMs: "avoid solutions resembling the examples" must be explicit

4. **The 3-Example Sweet Spot**
   - Too many examples → mode collapse
   - Too few examples → insufficient guidance
   - 3 examples = pattern recognition without gravitational lock
   - This is empirical gold from recent AI research (2025)

5. **Generative Principles vs Templates**
   - Alexander's defense: patterns should generate infinite variations
   - The problem: users treat them as templates anyway
   - The prompt/framing determines which mode users enter

6. **Context Gating**
   - Jazz: standards are launching pads, not cages
   - Design: "creative consistency" = bending rules while maintaining identity
   - Patterns serve the goal; they don't define the goal

### Universal Failures (What Doesn't Work)

1. **Hiding Knowledge**
   - Not teaching standards doesn't create freedom — it creates ignorance
   - Avant-garde WITHOUT academic foundation produces dilettantes, not innovators

2. **Just Adding Customization Options**
   - Bootstrap/Material UI offer customization, but it's rarely used
   - Cognitive cost of customization is TOO HIGH compared to using defaults
   - Users consciously choose speed over differentiation

3. **Hoping Diversity Emerges**
   - Without explicit diversity rewards, models collapse to frequent patterns
   - Without explicit "find your voice" emphasis, students copy teachers
   - Diversity requires ACTIVE cultivation, not passive hope

4. **Pattern Overload**
   - More patterns ≠ more creativity
   - Gang of Four patterns led to over-engineering
   - Design systems with 100 components create more sameness than systems with 20

5. **Treating Builders and Architects the Same**
   - Pattern languages work for builders (efficiency goal)
   - Pattern languages constrain architects (novelty goal)
   - One size does NOT fit all contexts

---

## TRANSFERABLE TO LLM AGENTS + DESIGN PATTERNS

### The Core Problem (Precisely Defined)

When LLM agents are loaded with design system patterns and asked to create layouts, they face:

- **Cognitive efficiency**: Using existing patterns is computationally cheaper than generating novel solutions
- **Frequency bias**: Patterns seen in training data + loaded in context dominate generation probability space
- **Template confusion**: Agents may treat generative principles as copy-paste templates
- **Role ambiguity**: Is the agent a builder (execute efficiently) or architect (create novelty)?

### What We Can Learn

**FROM JAZZ:**
- Internalize patterns, then explicitly forget them during initial ideation
- The prompt might need a "forget" phase: "Do not consciously access pattern library during initial design; trust intuition first, validate against patterns later"
- Parker's "wail" phase = unconstrained generation; evaluation comes after

**FROM DESIGN SYSTEMS:**
- The 3-example sweet spot: don't load ALL patterns — sample 2-4 relevant ones
- Acknowledge the speed-differentiation tradeoff: if novelty is the goal, state it explicitly
- "Creative consistency" framing: patterns define constraints, not solutions

**FROM ART EDUCATION:**
- Rebellion requires knowledge: patterns should be available for evaluation, not hidden
- The apprentice→master transition: initial phases might copy patterns; later phases break them
- MFA model: "find your voice despite knowing masters" → "find novel solution despite knowing patterns"

**FROM AI RESEARCH:**
- Explicit diversity rewards: "Generate solutions that differ from patterns X, Y, Z by at least [distance metric]"
- Hierarchical generation: create WITHOUT pattern context, THEN evaluate WITH pattern context
- Temperature/sampling: use higher temperature during ideation, lower during refinement

**FROM PATTERN LANGUAGES:**
- Generative principles vs templates: prompt must emphasize adaptation, not copying
- Builder vs architect roles: state the goal explicitly (efficiency vs novelty)
- Language limitations: maybe we need better compositional primitives, not just better pattern presentation

### Concrete Mechanisms to Test

1. **Two-Phase Prompting**
   - Phase 1: Generate solution WITHOUT pattern context (pure problem-solving)
   - Phase 2: Evaluate solution AGAINST patterns (validation, not generation)

2. **3-Example Sampling**
   - Don't load full pattern library
   - Select 2-4 patterns most relevant to constraints
   - Explicit instruction: "These are reference, not menu"

3. **Explicit Diversity Reward**
   - "Your solution should differ from the provided patterns by [specific criteria]"
   - "Avoid gravitating toward the provided examples; use them as contrast, not template"

4. **Role Declaration**
   - Builder mode: "Optimize for efficiency using established patterns"
   - Architect mode: "Optimize for novelty; patterns are evaluation criteria, not starting points"

5. **Temperature Scheduling**
   - High temperature (1.0+) during initial ideation
   - Low temperature (0.3-0.5) during refinement and pattern validation

6. **"Forget" Instruction**
   - "You have learned these patterns. Now forget them during design. Trust your intuition to solve the problem, THEN validate against patterns."
   - Mirrors Charlie Parker's "forget all that and just wail"

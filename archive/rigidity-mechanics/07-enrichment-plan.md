# Enrichment Plan: Reframing Documentation for Gallery-Not-Cookbook Access

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Planner:** rigidity-mechanics team enrichment planner
**Constraint:** Reduce gravitational pull WITHOUT reducing insight
**Core Principle:** "Here's exactly what we tested and what happened" (gallery) not "Here's what works and when to use it" (cookbook)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Gravity Paradox: **The most useful documents are the most gravitational.** The tension-composition skill works BECAUSE it's precise (839 lines, exact thresholds). The strategy library is valuable BECAUSE it categorizes (4 tiers, 6 recipes). We cannot make these less precise without destroying their utility.

**The solution: SAME precision, DIFFERENT framing.**

### The Two Critical Findings

1. **Timing and framing are deterministic** (cognitive mechanics research)
   - "When to use" triggers lookup mode → pattern-matching
   - "Here's proof" triggers derivation mode → fresh generation
   - SAME information, opposite creative outcomes

2. **Gravity cliff at pattern layer** (spectrum analysis)
   - Tokens/components/mechanisms = vocabulary (0-50% constraint)
   - Patterns/compositions = decisions (75-100% constraint)
   - The extractable design system is vocabulary; the gravitational danger is at the pattern layer

### The Anti-Gravity Intervention (6 parts)

1. **Timing Control:** Library consulted AFTER metaphor derivation (binary sequential rules)
2. **Framing Rewrite:** "Tension that produced this" not "When to use"
3. **Separation:** Mechanisms (reusable) split from case studies (inspirational)
4. **Explicit Divergence Language:** "You are EXPECTED to derive novel metaphor"
5. **Metaphor Commitment:** Lock-in BEFORE library access
6. **Diversity Tracking:** Make repetition visible, not invisible anchor

### Three Files Need Complete Reframing

1. **08-COMPOSITIONAL-STRATEGY-LIBRARY.md** (CRITICAL gravity — 1,747 lines)
2. **05-library-architecture.md** (CRITICAL gravity — 40-file spec designed before contents)
3. **tension-composition/SKILL.md** (HIGH gravity — 839 lines with exact thresholds)

---

## PART 1: FILE-BY-FILE ENRICHMENT PLAN

### 1.1 CRITICAL: 08-COMPOSITIONAL-STRATEGY-LIBRARY.md

**Current Gravity:** CRITICAL (TG + PP + VG)
- 4-tier classification system becomes THE ONLY way to think about extractability
- 6 Tier 3 recipes with "When to use:" and "Composition recipe:" — most prescriptive framing in project
- 1,747 lines create enormous volume gravity

**Reframing Strategy: Split + Reframe + Anti-Prescribe**

#### SPLIT: Two New Files

**File A: MECHANISM-CATALOG.md** (~400 lines)
- Extract ONLY the reusable techniques from Tier 2/2.5/3
- No metaphors, no "when to use", no page structures
- Pure technique: "Border-weight gradient — how it works, what it encodes, CSS implementation"
- Framing: "These are TOOLS you can use. Like a painter's brushes — you choose which to use and when."

**File B: METAPHOR-CASE-STUDIES.md** (~1,400 lines)
- All 6 Tier 3 recipes PLUS the tier system explanation
- **COMPLETE REFRAME** using anti-prescription pattern (see 1.2 below)
- Framing: "This is a GALLERY showing how tension derivation produced THESE metaphors. Your content's tension will lead to a DIFFERENT metaphor."

#### REFRAME: Every Tier 3 Recipe (6 total)

**Current Structure (PRESCRIPTIVE):**
```markdown
### Tier 3 Recipe: Geological Stratification

**When to use:**
- Content has clear certainty gradients (established → probable → speculative)
- Information has natural depth layering

**Composition recipe:**
1. Start with Tier 1 zone tokens
2. Apply Tier 2.5 confidence-encoding border weights
3. Set padding INVERSE to confidence: [specific values]
4. Background DARKENS with depth: [specific progression]
```

**New Structure (ANTI-PRESCRIPTION GALLERY):**
```markdown
### Case Study: Geological Stratification (DD-004)

⚠️ **READ THIS FIRST — THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE**

This is a WORKED EXAMPLE showing how tension derivation led to ONE specific metaphor for ONE specific content. Your content's tension will lead to a DIFFERENT metaphor. This case study serves three purposes:

1. **PROOF** that these tensions are resolvable compositionally
2. **MECHANISM EXTRACTION** — reusable techniques you can apply to YOUR metaphor
3. **PROCESS DOCUMENTATION** — learning how tension → metaphor → layout

**Your assignment:** Derive YOUR metaphor using this PROCESS, not this ANSWER.

---

#### Tension That Produced This

**Content analyzed:** Boris documentation (certainty spectrum, procedural depth)

**Phase 1 — Multi-Axis Questioning:**
[Show the ACTUAL questions asked, not generic templates]
- Warmth vs Austerity: Content balances practical warmth (step-by-step) with theoretical austerity (formal definitions)
- Confidence spectrum: Established facts (high confidence) → Speculative techniques (lower confidence)
- Information depth: Surface-level quickstart → Deep technical implementation

**Phase 2 — Tension Derivation:**
[Show the ACTUAL tension table]
| Side A | Opposition | Side B | Overlap | Width Score |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Warmth: practical steps | ←→ | Austerity: theoretical rigor | Both serve learning | 8/10 |
| High confidence facts | ←→ | Speculative hypotheses | Both are necessary knowledge | 9/10 |

**Richness Score:** 17/20 → Track 2 warranted

**Phase 3 — Search Query Generated:**
"What real-world domain naturally exhibits LAYERED DEPTH while being STABILITY-ENCODED yet EXPLORATION-PERMITTING?"

**Phase 3.5 — Metaphor Discovery:**
Geological stratification emerged: Earth's layers encode depth (surface → bedrock) and stability (older = deeper = more established).

---

#### The Search in Action (NOT a template — this is narrative)

The content had 6 natural groupings by certainty level. The geological metaphor suggested: treat high-certainty content as "bedrock" (deep, dark, stable) and low-certainty as "topsoil" (surface, light, dynamic).

The metaphor DICTATED the structure:
- 6 strata (matching the 6 content groupings)
- Depth gradient (darkening background, reducing padding)
- Border-weight encoding confidence (4px = bedrock, 1px = topsoil)

**THIS IS WHERE MECHANISMS WERE APPLIED** (see MECHANISM-CATALOG.md):
- Depth gradient technique (padding compression + background darkening)
- Border-weight semantic encoding (3-category system: 4px/3px/1px)
- 2-zone component DNA within each stratum (fractal self-similarity)

**Result:** DD-004 Geological Stratification layout (1,743 lines CSS)

---

#### What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)

**REUSABLE MECHANISMS** (apply to YOUR metaphor):
- ✅ Depth gradient (compression + darkening) — works for ANY depth-based metaphor
- ✅ Border-weight encoding — works for ANY hierarchy/certainty encoding
- ✅ Background progression — works for ANY continuous spectrum

**NOT REUSABLE** (specific to geological metaphor):
- ❌ 6-layer structure (your content may have 3 layers or 10)
- ❌ Geological vocabulary (strata, bedrock, topsoil)
- ❌ The specific padding values (48px → 24px) — these were derived for THIS content

---

#### Your Divergence Assignment

**Success Check:** If your metaphor is geological, ask: "Did I derive this independently, or pattern-match to this case study?"

If you derived geological independently (convergent discovery), GREAT — use the mechanisms catalog to implement efficiently.

If you pattern-matched to geological without deriving your own tension first, STOP. Re-run Phase 1-3 with this constraint: **"Geological is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"**

**Your divergence obligation:** The library should grow, not repeat. Three uses of geological is richness. Seven uses is pattern fatigue.

---

#### Post-Project Learning (Read AFTER you build)

[Current "Implementation Details" section preserved here — this is for learning, not building]
```

**Changes per recipe:**
- **BEFORE section:** "When to use:" → "Tension That Produced This" with ACTUAL Phase 1-2 derivation
- **NEW section:** "The Search in Action" (narrative, not recipe)
- **REFRAME section:** "Composition recipe:" → "What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)"
- **NEW section:** "Your Divergence Assignment" with explicit success check
- **MOVE section:** Implementation details → "Post-Project Learning" (read AFTER building)

**Cost:** +100 lines per recipe × 6 = +600 lines
**Benefit:** SAME information, opposite cognitive framing (gallery not cookbook)

---

### 1.2 CRITICAL: 05-library-architecture.md

**Current Gravity:** CRITICAL (SG)
- 40-file, 4-directory system designed BEFORE contents are known
- Exact file names and line counts create false precision
- Directory names (tier-1/, tier-2/, tier-3/) encode classification into file system itself

**Reframing Strategy: Defer + Flatten + Anti-Commit**

#### Structural Changes

**CURRENT (rigid):**
```
design-system/
  tier-1/
    tokens.css         (~120 lines)
    soul.css           (~30 lines)
  tier-2/
    callouts.css       (~60 lines)
    code-block.css     (~45 lines)
    [16 more files]
  tier-2.5/
    mechanisms.css     (~180 lines)
  tier-3/
    patterns/
      [6 case study files]
```

**REVISED (flexible):**
```
design-system/
  foundations/
    tokens.css
    soul.css
    README.md          "Universal constants — 0% gravity"

  components/
    [component files, NO implied hierarchy]
    README.md          "Structures — 10-20% gravity, parameterizable"

  mechanisms/
    CATALOG.md         "Reusable techniques — consult AFTER metaphor derivation"

  case-studies/
    GALLERY.md         "Proof-of-concept examples — read for PROCESS not TEMPLATES"
    geological.md
    pulse.md
    islands.md
    [etc.]
```

**Key changes:**
1. **Directory names changed:** tier-1/tier-2/tier-3 → foundations/components/mechanisms/case-studies
   - Removes numeric hierarchy (1 < 2 < 3 implies ordering)
   - Removes "tier" framing (which implies classification system is settled)
   - Names describe FUNCTION not RANK

2. **Line counts removed:** No "~60 lines" estimates — these create false precision

3. **File names deferred:** Only foundations/ and components/ have specific files listed
   - mechanisms/ and case-studies/ are single-file initially
   - Structure emerges from contents, not pre-planned

4. **README.md gravity warnings:** Each directory has a README stating its gravity level and usage guidance

#### Language Reframing

**Current (Line 8):**
"THE reference for extraction architecture — someone can read and build directly"

**Revised:**
"A hypothesis for extraction architecture — structure will be validated (and likely revised) during Phase C-D extraction. This is a STARTING POINT, not a blueprint."

**Current (Lines 68-72):**
"tier-3/patterns/geological.md — Geological stratification recipe (~250 lines)"

**Revised:**
"case-studies/GALLERY.md — All metaphor case studies in ONE file initially (avoid premature file proliferation). Split into per-metaphor files ONLY if gallery exceeds 2,000 lines."

**Current (Line 142):**
"40 files, ~3,200 lines total"

**Revised:**
"Estimated 15-25 files initially (foundations + components + 2 catalog files). Structure will grow organically based on ACTUAL extraction findings, not pre-planned categorization."

---

### 1.3 HIGH: tension-composition/SKILL.md

**Current Gravity:** HIGH (VG + PP)
- 839 lines create enormous volume gravity
- Exact thresholds (30%, 60%, ≥8 richness) become defaults
- 14-axis multi-axis questioning creates template agents optimize toward

**Reframing Strategy: Add Anti-Gravity Guardrails + Timing Rules**

#### NEW SECTION: Insert at Line 25 (before Content Type Classification)

```markdown
---

## ⚠️ ANTI-GRAVITY WARNING — READ BEFORE PROCEEDING

This skill contains EXACT thresholds, NUMERIC scores, and SPECIFIC axes. These create gravitational pull toward optimization targets (high richness scores, strong genuine tension, specific axis combinations).

**The traps:**
1. **Threshold Lock:** Treating 30%/60% content splits as RULES not HEURISTICS
2. **Score Gaming:** Optimizing for high richness scores rather than genuine composition needs
3. **Axis Template:** Using the 14 provided axes instead of deriving content-specific questions
4. **Pattern Matching:** Looking for content that FITS known tensions instead of deriving tension FROM content

**How to resist gravity:**
1. **Content-First Always:** Read content WITHOUT consulting this skill first. Form initial impressions. THEN use skill as framework.
2. **Thresholds Are Guidelines:** 30% and 60% are APPROXIMATE. Content at 35% density isn't "confused" — it's borderline. Use judgment.
3. **Richness Is Prediction Not Goal:** High richness predicts metaphor will be productive. It does NOT mean low-richness content needs metaphors forced onto it.
4. **Axes Are Starters Not Menu:** The 14 axes are EXAMPLES of productive questions. Your content may need DIFFERENT axes entirely. Invent them.

**Success check:** If your Phase 1 questions look IDENTICAL to the examples in this skill, you're pattern-matching. Rephrase to fit YOUR content's actual characteristics.

## ⚠️ BINARY SEQUENTIAL RULES — ANTI-PATTERN-MATCHING PROTOCOL

The compositional strategy library (08-COMPOSITIONAL-STRATEGY-LIBRARY.md / METAPHOR-CASE-STUDIES.md) contains 6 worked examples with specific metaphors. **These are GALLERY not MENU.**

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE (Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → Library):**

You MUST complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. ✅ **Phase 1:** Multi-axis questioning (14+ questions, content-specific)
2. ✅ **Phase 2:** Tension derivation (opposition + overlap + width scoring)
3. ✅ **Phase 3.4:** Search query construction
4. ✅ **Phase 3.5:** Metaphor candidate identification (NEW — see below)
5. 🚫 **PROHIBITION:** DO NOT consult the compositional strategy library until AFTER step 4
6. ✅ **Phase 4:** Mechanism extraction from library (NEW — see below)

**Why this order matters:**

If you read the library BEFORE deriving YOUR metaphor, your working memory will contain library patterns during metaphor generation. Retrieval-augmented generation will surface those patterns as candidates, and you'll pattern-match instead of derive.

**The library provides MECHANISMS for implementation, not TEMPLATES for selection.**

---

### Phase 3.5: Metaphor Commitment (NEW)

**After** you've constructed your search query (Phase 3.4), you must COMMIT to a metaphor candidate BEFORE consulting the library.

**Output required:**
```markdown
**Metaphor Candidate:** [Your metaphor]
**Why it resolves the tension:** [2-3 sentences explaining the match between metaphor properties and content tension]
**Commitment:** I am locking this metaphor in. Library consultation is for MECHANISMS only, not metaphor revision.
```

**Why this step exists:**

Without commitment, agents read the library, see a "better" metaphor, and switch. The switch happens POST-derivation, so it LOOKS like independent discovery but is actually pattern-matching. Commitment prevents post-generation gravitational pull.

---

### Phase 4: Mechanism Extraction (REVISED)

**After** Phase 3.5 metaphor commitment, consult the library for MECHANISMS to apply to YOUR metaphor.

**What to extract:**
- ✅ Reusable techniques (depth gradients, border-weight encoding, spacing compression)
- ✅ Component combinations (callouts + code blocks within larger structures)
- ✅ Universal mechanisms (3-category borders, 2-zone DNA, type cascade)

**What NOT to extract:**
- ❌ Page structures (6-layer geological layout, sparse/dense PULSE alternation)
- ❌ Metaphor vocabulary (strata, bedrock, topsoil)
- ❌ Section labels and content organization strategies

**Divergence verification (SUCCESS CHECK):**

Compare your committed metaphor (Phase 3.5) to the 6 library case studies:

| Library Pattern | Your Metaphor Similar? | If YES: Action Required |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Geological | ☐ | Justify convergence OR regenerate with constraint |
| PULSE | ☐ | Justify convergence OR regenerate with constraint |
| ISLANDS | ☐ | Justify convergence OR regenerate with constraint |
| [etc.] | ☐ | [etc.] |

**If ANY box is checked:**

Either (A) justify convergent discovery ("I derived geological independently, here's my Phase 1-2 work proving it"), or (B) regenerate Phase 3 with constraint: "[Pattern name] is taken, what ELSE resolves this tension?"

**Why this check exists:**

The library should GROW, not REPEAT. Three uses of a metaphor = richness (the metaphor is productive). Seven uses = pattern fatigue (we're defaulting, not deriving).

---
```

#### LANGUAGE CHANGES (throughout)

**Current (Line 93):**
"Key Principle: Opposition Predicts Richness"

**Revised:**
"Observed Pattern: Opposition tends to predict richness. But richness is EMERGENT from content properties, not a design goal to optimize toward."

**Current (Line 196):**
"Can you fulfill the reader's need by selecting and placing existing design system components without transforming their meaning?"

**Revised:**
"Can you fulfill the reader's need by selecting and placing existing design system components without transforming their meaning? NOTE: This is a HEURISTIC not a law. Some content is 40% assembly + 60% composition (hybrid). The binary is a starting point; reality is a spectrum."

**Current (Line 220-227 — The Tension Spectrum):**
Delete the 5-level spectrum entirely (NO TENSION → COSMETIC → WEAK GENUINE → STRONG GENUINE → IMPOSSIBLE). This hierarchy creates optimization targets.

**Replaced with:**
"Tension exists on a spectrum. The Phase 2 richness score (0-20) is a PREDICTION of metaphor productivity, not a QUALITY judgment of the content. Low-richness content (< 8) can still benefit from thoughtful layout; it just won't benefit from metaphor-driven transformation."

---

### 1.4 HIGH: pipeline/05-COMPLETE-ROADMAP.md

**Current Gravity:** HIGH (SG + VG)
- 835-line 9-phase sequential pipeline creates rigid execution order
- Phase naming forces work into categorical buckets

**Reframing Strategy: Loosen Sequence + Add Flexibility Markers**

#### Add Section at Top (after title)

```markdown
---

## ⚠️ ROADMAP FLEXIBILITY WARNING

This roadmap prescribes a 9-phase sequence (A → I). In practice, phases will overlap, reorder, and iterate. The sequence represents ONE possible path, not THE path.

**Expected deviations:**
- Phase C (mechanism extraction) may reveal findings that require Phase B (component extraction) revision
- Phase E (tier classification) may uncover new mechanisms, requiring Phase C return
- Phase G (case studies) may identify missing foundational tokens, requiring Phase A return

**The roadmap is a STARTING POINT. Actual execution will be messier, more iterative, and context-driven.**

**How to use this document:**
- First pass: sequential A → I (establish baseline)
- Subsequent work: jump between phases as findings require
- Final pass: verification that all phases reached stable state

---
```

#### Change Phase Headers from Prescriptive to Descriptive

**Current:** "Phase C: Mechanism Extraction (20-35 hours)"
**Revised:** "Phase C: Mechanism Extraction (estimated 20-35 hours, may expand if new mechanisms discovered)"

**Current:** "Phase E: Tier Classification & Strategy Library (40-60 hours)"
**Revised:** "Phase E: Extractability Analysis & Documentation (40-80 hours — MOST uncertain, prior estimates were 50% low)"

---

### 1.5 HIGH: pipeline/07-TRACK-2-COMPOSITIONAL-SUPPLEMENT.md

**Current Gravity:** HIGH (TG + PP)
- Track 1 vs Track 2 binary classification forecloses hybrid approaches
- Richness threshold "≥ 8" becomes rigid cutoff
- Addition Test and BECAUSE Test are prescriptive gatekeepers

**Reframing Strategy: Binary → Spectrum + Threshold → Guideline**

#### Replace Section "Track Classification" (Lines 32-43)

**Current:**
```markdown
## Track Classification

Content falls into one of two tracks:
- **Track 1:** Assembly (select + arrange existing components)
- **Track 2:** Compositional transformation (derive metaphor, compose layout)

**Test:** The Addition Test
Can you fulfill the reader's need by selecting and placing existing components without transforming their meaning?
- YES → Track 1
- NO → Track 2
```

**Revised:**
```markdown
## Track Spectrum (Not Binary)

Content exists on a spectrum from pure assembly (0%) to pure transformation (100%). Most content is HYBRID (mix of both).

**Track 1 (0-40% transformation):** Primarily assembly
- Existing components fulfill reader needs with minimal adaptation
- Layout is arrangement-focused (place components in logical order)
- Example: Tutorial with standard callouts, code blocks, definition lists

**Hybrid (40-60% transformation):** Mix of assembly and composition
- Some sections use existing components; others need metaphor-driven layout
- Layout has both conventional areas and novel compositional areas
- Example: Documentation with standard components BUT a custom comparison matrix requiring bespoke layout

**Track 2 (60-100% transformation):** Primarily compositional
- Reader needs require metaphor-driven layout transformation
- Existing components are MATERIALS but not SOLUTIONS
- Example: Boris documentation with geological stratification (content has inherent tension requiring compositional resolution)

**The Tests (Heuristics, Not Laws):**

1. **Addition Test:** Can you fulfill the reader's need by selecting and placing existing components without transforming their meaning?
   - YES (confidently) → likely Track 1
   - NO (confidently) → likely Track 2
   - PARTIALLY → Hybrid (use judgment on which sections need transformation)

2. **BECAUSE Test:** Why can't existing components serve this need?
   - "BECAUSE content has inherent tension requiring compositional resolution" → Track 2
   - "BECAUSE we want it to look different" → Cosmetic (Track 1 with custom styling)
   - "BECAUSE some sections have tension but others don't" → Hybrid

**Richness Score Guidance (Not Cutoffs):**

| Richness Score | Interpretation | Suggested Track |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0-4 | Low tension | Track 1 (assembly sufficient) |
| 5-7 | Moderate tension | Hybrid (evaluate per section) |
| 8-12 | High tension | Track 2 (composition warranted) |
| 13-20 | Extreme tension | Track 2 (composition essential) |

**The ≥8 threshold is a GUIDELINE not a RULE.** Content scoring 7 might still benefit from targeted compositional transformation in high-tension sections, while using assembly for low-tension areas.

**Success check:** If you're forcing content into Track 1 or Track 2 buckets uncomfortably, it's probably Hybrid. That's fine. Handle each section according to its needs.
```

---

### 1.6 MEDIUM: Other Files

**01-rigidity-free-architecture.md, 06-synthesis-blueprint.md, 07-synthesis.md (inventory)**

**Reframing:** Change all instances of "THE answer" / "THE solution" / "THE true count" to "A hypothesis" / "Current findings" / "Best estimate as of [date]"

**Add headers:**
```markdown
## Document Status: HYPOTHESIS

This document presents findings from research as of 2026-02-14. These are CURRENT BEST ESTIMATES, not settled facts. Subsequent phases (C-I extraction) will likely revise these numbers, structures, and classifications.

Treat this as a STARTING POINT for validation, not a blueprint for execution.
```

---

## PART 2: NEW DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS

### 2.1 The Gallery-Not-Cookbook Principle

**FOR ALL FUTURE PATTERN DOCUMENTATION:**

#### Template: Case Study Format

```markdown
### Case Study: [Pattern Name] ([Source File])

⚠️ **THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE** — This is a worked example showing how tension derivation led to ONE metaphor for ONE content. Your content will lead to a DIFFERENT metaphor.

---

#### Purpose of This Case Study

1. **PROOF:** [This tension type] is compositionally resolvable
2. **MECHANISM EXTRACTION:** Reusable techniques applicable to YOUR metaphor
3. **PROCESS LEARNING:** How tension → metaphor → layout transformation works

**Your assignment:** Use this PROCESS, not this ANSWER.

---

#### Tension That Produced This

**Content analyzed:** [Specific content]

**Phase 1 — Multi-Axis Questioning:**
[Show ACTUAL questions asked for THIS content, not generic templates]

**Phase 2 — Tension Derivation:**
[Show ACTUAL tension table]

**Richness Score:** X/20 → [Interpretation]

**Phase 3 — Search Query Generated:**
"[Exact query derived from tension properties]"

**Phase 3.5 — Metaphor Discovery:**
[How the metaphor emerged from the search]

---

#### The Search in Action (Narrative)

[Tell the story of how this metaphor resolved this tension. NOT step-by-step instructions — NARRATIVE of what happened and why.]

---

#### What YOU Extract

**REUSABLE MECHANISMS** (apply to YOUR metaphor):
- ✅ [Mechanism 1] — works for [general case]
- ✅ [Mechanism 2] — works for [general case]

**NOT REUSABLE** (specific to THIS metaphor):
- ❌ [Pattern-specific structure]
- ❌ [Pattern-specific vocabulary]
- ❌ [Pattern-specific values]

---

#### Your Divergence Assignment

**Success Check:** If your metaphor is [PATTERN NAME], ask: "Did I derive this independently, or pattern-match to this case study?"

**Convergent discovery** = You derived independently, validated by showing Phase 1-2 work
**Pattern-matching** = You read this, saw similarity, copied structure

If pattern-matching, STOP. Re-run Phase 3 with constraint: "[PATTERN NAME] is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"

---

#### Post-Project Learning (Read AFTER Building)

[Technical implementation details, CSS, component composition — for learning after you've already built your own solution]
```

### 2.2 Anti-Gravity Framing Templates

#### For Thresholds/Cutoffs:

❌ **Weak:** "Content with >60% unfamiliar terminology is theoretical"
✅ **Strong:** "In our analysis, content with >60% unfamiliar terminology tended to be theoretical. This is a PATTERN we observed, not a rule. Your content at 55% may still be theoretical if other factors are present."

#### For Classifications:

❌ **Weak:** "There are three types: A, B, C"
✅ **Strong:** "We observed three clusters: A, B, C. These are ANALYTICAL GROUPINGS, not natural categories. Real content may be hybrid (A+B) or outside this taxonomy entirely."

#### For Processes:

❌ **Weak:** "Follow these steps: 1, 2, 3"
✅ **Strong:** "We followed this sequence: 1, 2, 3. This worked for THESE cases. Your content may need different sequencing, additional steps, or steps 1 and 3 without 2."

#### For Examples:

❌ **Weak:** "When to use [pattern]: [criteria list]"
✅ **Strong:** "Tension that produced [pattern]: [specific tension from specific content]. If YOUR content has similar tension, you MAY converge to a similar metaphor (convergent discovery). If you converge, show your Phase 1-2 work proving independent derivation."

#### For Scores/Metrics:

❌ **Weak:** "Richness ≥ 8 warrants Track 2"
✅ **Strong:** "In our samples, richness ≥ 8 predicted productive metaphor derivation. This is a HEURISTIC not a cutoff. Content scoring 7 might still benefit from targeted composition in high-tension sections."

### 2.3 Warning/Guardrail Language for Pattern Docs

#### Mandatory Sections for ALL Pattern Documentation:

1. **⚠️ Anti-Template Warning** (top of document)
   - "This is NOT a template"
   - "Your assignment: use the PROCESS, not the ANSWER"

2. **Divergence Assignment** (end of document)
   - Success check: "Did I derive this or pattern-match?"
   - Explicit convergence vs. pattern-matching distinction
   - Action if pattern-matched: regenerate with constraint

3. **Mechanism Extraction Guidance** (middle of document)
   - Clear separation: REUSABLE vs. NOT REUSABLE
   - ✅/❌ markers for scannable distinction

4. **Post-Project Learning Section** (end of document)
   - Technical details for AFTER you've built your own solution
   - Framed as "how we implemented THIS" not "how to implement YOURS"

### 2.4 The 3-Example Sweet Spot (from AI research)

**DO NOT load all patterns into agent context.**

Instead:
- Select 2-4 most relevant case studies based on content tension type
- Load ONLY those case studies + the mechanism catalog
- Explicit instruction: "These are REFERENCE not MENU"

**Why 3 (not 1, not 10):**
- 1 example = copying (agent treats it as template)
- 3 examples = pattern recognition + diversity awareness
- 10 examples = mode collapse (agent optimizes toward frequent patterns)

**From research:** "n=3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus" (arXiv 2512.24120)

---

## PART 3: STRUCTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 3.1 Should the Tier System Be Restructured?

**Current:** Tier 1 (tokens/soul) → Tier 2 (components) → Tier 2.5 (mechanisms) → Tier 3 (patterns)

**Problems:**
1. Numeric ordering (1 < 2 < 3) implies hierarchy/progression
2. "Tier" framing suggests rigid classification
3. The .5 suffix (Tier 2.5) signals "we couldn't fit this in the system cleanly"

**Recommendation: YES — Replace with Functional Naming**

**Revised Structure:**

```
Foundations (Tier 1)
  - Tokens, Soul, Base rules
  - 0% gravity (pure vocabulary)
  - File: foundations/

Components (Tier 2)
  - Callouts, code blocks, tables, etc.
  - 10-20% gravity (default structures)
  - File: components/

Mechanisms (Tier 2.5)
  - Universal mechanisms (borders, type, spacing, 2-zone DNA)
  - Pattern-specific mechanisms (compression, width-encoding)
  - 30-95% gravity split (universal = high, pattern-specific = medium)
  - File: mechanisms/CATALOG.md

Case Studies (Tier 3)
  - PULSE, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, etc.
  - 75-80% gravity (metaphor-driven decisions)
  - File: case-studies/GALLERY.md
```

**Why this is better:**
- Names describe FUNCTION not RANK
- No numeric ordering implying progression
- "Catalog" and "Gallery" frame usage (tools vs. inspiration)
- Gravity levels stated explicitly in documentation

### 3.2 Should Track 1/Track 2 Binary Be Replaced?

**Current:** Track 1 (assembly) vs. Track 2 (composition) — binary classification

**Problems:**
1. Forces content into buckets (what about content that's 50% assembly + 50% composition?)
2. Addition Test and BECAUSE Test are gatekeepers creating rigid decision points
3. ≥8 richness threshold becomes a cutoff, not a guideline

**Recommendation: YES — Replace with Spectrum + Guidance**

**Revised Framing:**

```
Assembly ←――――――――――――――――――――――――→ Composition
   0%         40%        60%         100%

Track 1    Hybrid A   Hybrid B    Track 2
```

**Classification Guidance (Not Rules):**
- 0-40% transformation: Track 1 (assembly sufficient)
- 40-60% transformation: Hybrid (section-by-section evaluation)
- 60-100% transformation: Track 2 (composition warranted)

**Richness Score Interpretation:**
- 0-4: Low tension → Track 1 likely
- 5-7: Moderate tension → Evaluate (possibly Hybrid)
- 8-12: High tension → Track 2 likely
- 13-20: Extreme tension → Track 2 essential

**Tests Become Heuristics:**
- Addition Test: "CAN you fulfill needs with existing components?" (not "MUST you")
- BECAUSE Test: "WHY can't existing components serve this need?" (distinguish genuine from cosmetic)

**Success check:** "Am I forcing this content into Track 1 or 2 uncomfortably?" → It's probably Hybrid

### 3.3 How Should File/Folder Organization Change?

**See Section 1.2 (library-architecture.md reframing)**

**Key changes:**
1. **Defer structure decisions:** Don't design 40-file system before extraction
2. **Functional naming:** foundations/, components/, mechanisms/, case-studies/ (not tier-1/, tier-2/, tier-3/)
3. **Consolidate initially:** mechanisms/CATALOG.md and case-studies/GALLERY.md are SINGLE FILES until content warrants splitting
4. **Gravity warnings in READMEs:** Each directory has README stating gravity level and usage guidance

### 3.4 Loading Order Recommendations

**From cognitive mechanics research: "Timing is the master variable"**

**Recommended Loading Sequence for Agents Building Track 2 Layouts:**

**Phase 0: Content Only**
- Agent reads ONLY the content
- No design system documentation loaded
- Forms initial impressions, identifies reader needs

**Phase 1-2: Skill Only**
- Agent loads tension-composition skill
- Runs multi-axis questioning (Phase 1)
- Derives tension table (Phase 2)
- Still NO pattern library access

**Phase 3: Search Query Construction**
- Agent generates search query from tension properties
- Still NO pattern library access
- Query is CONSTRUCTED (from tension) not RETRIEVED (from library)

**Phase 3.5: Metaphor Commitment**
- Agent identifies metaphor candidate
- COMMITS to candidate with written justification
- Still NO pattern library access

**Phase 4: Mechanism Extraction**
- Agent NOW loads mechanisms/CATALOG.md
- Extracts relevant techniques to apply to committed metaphor
- Pattern library (case-studies/GALLERY.md) remains OFF-LIMITS

**Phase 5: Divergence Verification**
- Agent NOW loads case-studies/GALLERY.md
- Compares committed metaphor to library patterns
- If convergent: justify independent derivation
- If pattern-matched: flag for regeneration

**Phase 6: Implementation**
- Agent loads foundations/ and components/
- Builds layout using committed metaphor + extracted mechanisms + base vocabulary

**Why this order:**
- Library is UNAVAILABLE during creative phase (Phase 3)
- Commitment happens BEFORE library exposure (prevents post-generation switching)
- Library provides MECHANISMS (Phase 4) and VERIFICATION (Phase 5), not generation

**Enforcement:** Binary sequential rules in skill (see Section 1.3)

## PART 4: SKILL ENRICHMENT

### 4.1 tension-composition/SKILL.md Changes

**See Section 1.3 for complete reframing.**

**Summary of additions:**
1. ⚠️ Anti-Gravity Warning (insert at Line 25)
2. Binary Sequential Rules section (insert at Line 196)
3. Phase 3.5: Metaphor Commitment (NEW phase)
4. Phase 4: Mechanism Extraction (REVISED from current)
5. Divergence Verification table (SUCCESS CHECK)
6. Language changes throughout (thresholds → guidelines, principles → observed patterns)

**Anti-Gravity Guardrails Added:**
- Explicit prohibition: "DO NOT consult library during Phase 1-3"
- Mandatory commitment before library access
- Divergence verification requirement
- Pattern fatigue warning (3 uses = richness, 7 uses = fatigue)

### 4.2 perceptual-auditing/SKILL.md Changes

**Current State:** 48 audit questions define "quality" — agents optimize toward these questions

**Recommendation: Add Meta-Audit Section**

Insert at top:

```markdown
## ⚠️ Meta-Audit Warning

These 48 questions define quality criteria for metaphor-driven layouts. They are DERIVED from analysis of 15 successful Track 2 compositions (tension-test layouts + DD/OD explorations).

**The trap:** Optimizing toward these questions during BUILDING.

**Correct usage:** Use these questions for VERIFICATION after building, not as DESIGN GOALS during building.

**Why:** If you design to answer these questions well, you'll create layouts that AUDIT well but may not serve reader needs optimally. The questions verify that metaphor execution is perceptually sound — they don't define what the metaphor should be.

**Analogy:** These questions are like code review criteria. You don't write code to pass code review; you write code to solve the problem, THEN verify it passes review.

---

## Question Categories

[Existing 48 questions remain unchanged]
```

**Additional change:** Rename "Guardrails" section to "Perceptual Floors (Not Targets)"

**Language change:**
- Current: "940px minimum container width"
- Revised: "940px minimum container width (FLOOR — exceeding this is encouraged when metaphor warrants it)"

### 4.3 Anti-Gravity Guardrails in Skills Themselves

**Both skills need these additions:**

#### 1. Timing Prohibitions

```markdown
**DO NOT consult [other documentation] during [creative phase].**

This prohibition exists because WHEN you access reference material determines its gravitational effect. Reading patterns BEFORE deriving YOUR solution creates pattern-matching behavior.

Read patterns AFTER committing to your approach for mechanism extraction and verification only.
```

#### 2. Commitment Requirements

```markdown
**You MUST commit to [decision] BEFORE accessing [library].**

Write down your decision and reasoning. Lock it in. Library access is for IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS, not DECISION REVISION.

If library exposure causes you to change your decision, you pattern-matched. Regenerate with explicit constraint: "[Library pattern] is taken, what ELSE works?"
```

#### 3. Divergence Verification

```markdown
**SUCCESS CHECK:** Compare your output to [reference examples].

| Reference | Similar? | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Example A | ☐ YES ☐ NO | If YES: justify convergence OR regenerate |
| Example B | ☐ YES ☐ NO | If YES: justify convergence OR regenerate |

**Convergent discovery** = You derived independently (show your Phase 1-2 work)
**Pattern-matching** = You read example, saw similarity, adapted it

Pattern-matching is NOT wrong — but it should be CONSCIOUS. If you pattern-matched, acknowledge it. If you want to be creative, regenerate.
```

#### 4. Explicit Diversity Rewards

```markdown
**Your creative obligation:** Generate solutions that DIFFER from known patterns.

The library should GROW (new metaphors) not REPEAT (same metaphors). Using a metaphor that's been used 3× already is fine IF you derived it independently. Using it 7× suggests defaulting.

**Diversity reward:** Novel metaphors are MORE valuable than optimal execution of known metaphors.
```

## PART 6: SUCCESS METRICS

### How to Know if Enrichment Worked

**Metric 1: Pattern-Matching Rate**

Build 5 new Track 2 pages. Count how many use library metaphors vs. novel metaphors.

- **Before enrichment (predicted):** 60-80% pattern-match to library
- **After enrichment (target):** 10-20% pattern-match (only convergent discovery)

**Metric 2: Divergence Verification Completion**

Do agents actually fill out the divergence verification table (Phase 5)?

- **Target:** 100% completion (enforced by binary sequential rule)

**Metric 3: Metaphor Fatigue Visibility**

When agents use a library metaphor for the 4th time, do they acknowledge repetition?

- **Target:** 100% acknowledgment with justification

**Metric 4: Commitment Lock-In**

After Phase 3.5 commitment, how often do agents switch metaphors after reading library?

- **Before enrichment (predicted):** 40-60% switch (library causes revision)
- **After enrichment (target):** 0-5% switch (commitment holds)

**Metric 5: Library Access Timing**

At what point in the pipeline do agents first read the case studies?

- **Before enrichment (predicted):** Phase 1-2 (early consultation)
- **After enrichment (target):** Phase 5 only (after commitment)

### Red Flags (Signs Enrichment Failed)

1. **Agents read case studies during Phase 1-3** → Timing prohibition not enforced
2. **Agents skip Phase 3.5 commitment** → Binary sequential rule not strong enough
3. **Agents use library metaphors without justifying convergence** → Divergence verification not enforced
4. **Agents optimize for perceptual audit scores during building** → Meta-audit warning insufficient
5. **New documentation added without anti-prescription framing** → Conventions not adopted

---

## CONCLUSION

The Gravity Paradox cannot be solved by making documents less precise. Precision is what makes them useful. The solution is **SAME PRECISION, DIFFERENT FRAMING.**

### The Core Interventions

1. **Timing Control:** Library consulted AFTER metaphor derivation (not before)
2. **Framing Rewrite:** "Tension that produced this" not "When to use"
3. **Separation:** Mechanisms (reusable tools) split from case studies (inspirational gallery)
4. **Explicit Permission:** "You are EXPECTED to derive novel metaphors"
5. **Commitment Requirement:** Lock-in metaphor BEFORE library access
6. **Diversity Tracking:** Make repetition visible through verification tables

### The Three Critical Files

1. **08-COMPOSITIONAL-STRATEGY-LIBRARY.md** → Split + reframe all 6 recipes
2. **05-library-architecture.md** → Defer structure, flatten hierarchy, functional naming
3. **tension-composition/SKILL.md** → Add timing prohibitions, commitment phase, divergence verification

### The Validation Test

Build the SAME content with 4 variants (no library, old library, new library, library-first). Measure pattern-matching rate. If Variant C (new library with anti-prescription framing) achieves <20% pattern-matching with HIGH quality, the intervention WORKED.

**The enrichment plan is complete. Implementation can begin.**

**Purpose:** Verify that the vocab-vs-library question is prominently documented across all relevant files, not buried in one place.

## THE QUESTION

When a builder uses the 18 mechanisms (dark header, border-weight encoding, gestalt spacing, etc.) to build a new page with a NEW metaphor, is that:
- **(a) Grammar usage** -- transferable patterns applied to new content (encouraged, enables richness)
- **(b) Copying** -- replicating what showcase pages did (discouraged by anti-gravity)

This is theoretically resolved (Name Test + Transfer Test = (a)) but NEVER practically tested. The Middle-tier experiment is the first practical test.

## CROSS-REFERENCE STATUS

### FILE 1: ephemeral/doc-enrichment/03-ENTRY-POINT.md

**Before:** KEY CONTEXT #2 mentioned "vocabulary vs prohibition" as a settled distinction. Did not raise the untested practical dimension.

**After edit:** KEY CONTEXT #2 now explicitly flags this as "THE central open question." Added: the distinction is theoretically resolved but NEVER practically tested; Variant B scored 4/5 novelty because it DIDN'T heavily use vocabulary; the Middle-tier experiment directly tests this; cross-references to 02-tier-methodology.md Section 6 and 07-open-threads-and-gaps.md OT-03.

**Edit location:** Lines 21-22 (expanded from 2 sentences to a full paragraph with practical framing)

---

### FILE 2: ephemeral/doc-enrichment/02-tier-methodology.md

**Before:** Section 6 had excellent theoretical resolution (Name Test, Transfer Test, grammar/ vs case-studies/ separation, concrete CSS comparisons) but treated the question as RESOLVED. Did not address whether high mechanism density itself produces derivative-feeling output.

**After edit:** Added new subsection "The Untested Practical Dimension: Mechanism Density and Perceived Novelty" at the end of Section 6 (before Section 7). This subsection:
- Frames the precise question: does a page with 8-10 mechanisms feel novel or derivative?
- Presents evidence for both sides (Name Test for (a); Variant B's low-density high-novelty for (b))
- Explains why the Middle-tier experiment is the first practical test
- States the implications: if derivative, anti-gravity needs to address mechanism combination divergence

**Edit location:** After the R2 architectural separation paragraph, before Section 7 divider

---

### FILE 3: ephemeral/doc-enrichment/05-richness-journey.md

**Before:** Section 7 "OPEN FRONTIERS" had a "Vocabulary-vs-Library Frontier" subsection covering library EXPOSURE contamination (Variant C convergence). Did not address the deeper question of whether mechanism density itself creates convergence.

**After edit:** Renamed subsection header to include "(THE Central Open Question)". Added paragraph after the library-exposure discussion framing the DEEPER untested dimension: mechanism density at 8-10 may create a recognizable "house style" even without case study exposure. Frames the question precisely: grammar usage vs template convergence. Lists 3 specific implications. Notes the Middle-tier experiment as the first practical test.

**Edit location:** Extended the existing "Vocabulary-vs-Library Frontier" subsection in Section 7

---

### FILE 4: ephemeral/continuity-docs/HANDOFF.md

**Before:** Section 7 covered the distinction with Name Test, Transfer Test, grammar/ vs case-studies/, and anti-gravity enforcement. Framed as RESOLVED.

**After edit:** Added "OPEN QUESTION -- Mechanism Density and Perceived Novelty" paragraph after the anti-gravity enforcement paragraph. Explicitly flags: resolved in THEORY, not in PRACTICE. Raises the question of whether higher technique density would have reduced Variant B's perceived novelty. Notes the Middle-tier experiment as the direct test. States implications for anti-gravity if results show derivative output.

**Edit location:** After the R2/R6 enforcement paragraph, before Section 8 divider

---

### FILE 5: ephemeral/continuity-docs/07-open-threads-and-gaps.md

**Before:** OT-03 covered vocab-vs-library with focus on library EXPOSURE contamination (Builder A vs Builder B with/without case studies). Did not address the separate question of whether HIGH mechanism density from grammar/ alone produces derivative output.

**After edit:** Added "The deeper untested dimension (mechanism density itself)" paragraph after the original resolution proposal. This paragraph:
- Separates the mechanism-density question from the library-exposure question
- Explains why 8-10 mechanisms might create a recognizable visual signature
- Notes the Middle-tier experiment tests this passively
- Upgraded priority assessment: library-exposure stays MEDIUM, but mechanism-density-novelty is effectively tested by the HIGHEST-priority OT-02 experiment

**Edit location:** After the controlled comparison proposal, before the Priority line (which was also updated)

## CROSS-REFERENCE NETWORK

The question now appears prominently in ALL 5 files with distinct framing appropriate to each document's purpose:

| File | Role | Framing |
|------|------|---------|
| 03-ENTRY-POINT.md | Orientation | "THE central open question" -- flags it as unresolved for any new instance |
| 02-tier-methodology.md | Technical detail | Full subsection with evidence for both sides + experimental implications |
| 05-richness-journey.md | Narrative context | "THE Central Open Question" in OPEN FRONTIERS -- connects to project vision |
| HANDOFF.md | Handoff reference | "OPEN QUESTION" callout in the vocab-vs-library section -- prevents new instances from treating it as settled |
| 07-open-threads-and-gaps.md | Research gaps | Expanded OT-03 with separate mechanism-density dimension + priority linkage to OT-02 |

## KEY FRAMING CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL FILES

All 5 edits share this consistent framing:
1. The theoretical resolution (Name Test, Transfer Test) is sound
2. It has NEVER been tested in practice
3. The Middle-tier experiment is the first practical test
4. If the result feels derivative, anti-gravity needs expansion beyond metaphor divergence
5. This question shapes how builders approach EVERY tier experiment

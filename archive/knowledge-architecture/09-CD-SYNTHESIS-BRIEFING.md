# CD SYNTHESIS BRIEFING
## Comprehensive Pre-Execution Research Synthesis for Stage 5 (Combination Dimension)

**Synthesized from:** 8 research outputs (01-DD through 08-Cross-Stage), ~2,800 lines of source material
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Purpose:** Everything a CD execution team needs to plan and build Stage 5

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

CD (Combination Dimension) is the **terminal exploration stage** of the KortAI design pipeline. Where DD discovered density vocabulary, OD discovered organizational structure, and AD discovered spatial geometry, CD tests whether these three dimensions -- now proven to be one unified phenomenon called ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (AD-F-023) -- remain unified when their patterns are **combined**. CD is not discovering a new dimension; it is a **stress test** of the 3-way equivalence under combination pressure. Its primary research source is R-5 (Combination Theory, 39 findings, ~75-80% unapplied), and its gate finding is DD-F-013 (component density tolerance). CD produces the final identity document (ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3), combination rules, CD-F-### findings, and a handoff to Migration -- the last phase before patterns become real documentation pages.

## 2. WHAT CD INHERITS (The Accumulated Context)

CD sits at the TOP of a 5-stage pipeline and inherits the most accumulated context of any stage. The full inheritance:

### 2.1 Pattern Vocabulary (20 validated patterns)

| Stage | Patterns | Avg Score | Finding Count |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| DD (Density) | 6+2: PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL, FRACTAL (+BOOKENDS, WAVE) | 34.5/40 | 18 DD-F |
| OD (Organization) | 6: CONVERSATIONAL, NARRATIVE, TASK-BASED, CONFIDENCE, SPATIAL, CREATIVE | ~35.5/40 | 17 OD-F |
| AD (Axis) | 6: Z-PATTERN, F-PATTERN, BENTO GRID, SPIRAL, CHOREOGRAPHY, COMPOUND | 36.2/40 | 28 AD-F |
| **Total** | **20 core patterns** | **Ascending quality** | **84 prior findings** (COMP-F:21 + DD-F:18 + OD-F:17 + AD-F:28) |

### 2.2 The 3-Way Unification (Inherited as Axiom)

```
DD-F-010: "Organization should SERVE density"
    -> OD-F-005: "Organization IS Density" (2-way identity)
        -> AD-F-004: "Axis IS Organization IS Density" (3-way identity)
            -> AD-F-023: ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (meta-equivalence)
```

CD inherits this chain as AXIOM, not hypothesis. The question for CD is whether combination **preserves** it.

### 2.3 Research Inheritance

| Research | Total | Applied | CD Role | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| R-1 | 28 | 22 (78.6%) | Secondary | 8 unapplied, low CD relevance |
| R-2 | 27 | ~18 (~67%) | Secondary | AD mapped 25; ~7 deferred to CD |
| R-3 | 51 | ~10 (~20%) | Reference | Low direct CD relevance |
| R-4 | 192 | 169 (~88%) | Reference | AD's primary; heavily consumed |
| **R-5** | **39** | **2 (5%)** | **PRIMARY** | **37 unapplied = CD's main job** |
| EXT-OD | 94 | 91 (96.8%) | Inherited | OD bespoke research |
| EXT-AXIS | 33 | ~30 | Inherited | AD bespoke research |

**The critical number: R-5 is 75-80% unapplied.** The existing `combination-rules.md` captures only ~4 of 39 findings as explicit rules. CD must dramatically close this gap.

### 2.4 Soul Compliance Record

| Check | Cumulative Elements Tested | Violations | Status |
|-------|---------------------------|------------|--------|
| border-radius: 0 | ~19,669+ | 0 | LOCKED |
| box-shadow: none | ~19,669+ | 0 | LOCKED |
| opacity: 1.0 | ~19,669+ | 0 | LOCKED |
| Font trio (after fonts.ready) | ~19,669+ | 0 | LOCKED |
| No 6th soul piece | Tested DD/OD/AD | None found | 5-piece model FINAL |

### 2.5 Convention Spec Inheritance

AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (822 lines, 16 sections) is inherited wholesale. Sections 1-11 from OD, sections 12-16 AD-specific. CD adds sections 17-20.

### 2.6 Transition Grammar (AD-F-025)

5x5 matrix classifying 20 directed pattern transitions:
- **Smooth (4 pairs):** Same mechanism, compatible density (Z-to-F, Bento-to-Choreography)
- **Bridge (10 pairs):** Different mechanisms, need intermediary
- **Breathing (6 pairs):** Most cognitively distinct, require 48px+ gap (all Spiral transitions)
- **Choreography** is the universal bridge; **Spiral** is the most isolated pattern

### 2.7 ANTI-PHYSICAL Identity

The system rejects ALL physicality cues: decorative depth, animated z-movement, rounded shapes, material gradients, traffic-light semantics, parallax. AD-005 extended this: "Choreography" means reader attention movement through static structure, NOT CSS animation. Combination dynamics are STRUCTURAL, not animated.

---

## 3. THE 6 CD EXPLORATIONS -- WHAT EACH DOES

### CD-001: Reasoning Inside Code
- **Content scenario:** How reasoning content combines with code blocks
- **Pattern combination:** F-PATTERN + BENTO + CRESCENDO
- **R5 findings tested:** H2 (functional contrast creates harmony), R1 (kinship -- cousins), T1 (productive tension)
- **Key question:** Does reasoning density build within code container boundaries? Does the velocity mismatch rule (T2) hold when a SLOW component (Reasoning) is placed inside/adjacent to another SLOW (Code)?
- **Risk:** This tests a "No" pairing in the compatibility matrix (Code+Reasoning is "Yes," but stacking two SLOW components challenges R5-T2)

### CD-002: Task Containing Decision
- **Content scenario:** How task structures contain decision-point content
- **Pattern combination:** Z-PATTERN + SPIRAL + PULSE
- **R5 findings tested:** H4 (editorial spread), S1 (setup-payoff arc), A3 (decision paralysis -- does this create or prevent it?)
- **Key question:** Can decision-point density pulse within task container confidence strata? Does the Setup-Payoff Arc apply when tasks contain decision matrices?
- **Risk:** Decision Matrix + Reasoning is a "Yes" pair, but embedding Matrix INSIDE Task Component may violate the nesting-not-stacking principle (R5-N1)

### CD-003: File Tree with Callouts
- **Content scenario:** How hierarchical navigation combines with annotation
- **Pattern combination:** BENTO + CHOREOGRAPHY + ISLANDS
- **R5 findings tested:** H3 (visual anchors -- both are left-anchored), H4 (editorial spread), G2 (container signal)
- **Key question:** Does hierarchical navigation choreography preserve island independence? Can File Tree and Callouts coexist given they're both left-anchored?
- **Risk:** File Tree is Heavy/MEDIUM/Neutral; most Callouts are Light/FAST/varied temperature. The weight contrast should create good rhythm, but the shared left-anchor could create visual monotony

### CD-004: Essence as Background (Ambient Context Layer)
- **Content scenario:** How wisdom/essence content serves as ambient context persisting through sections
- **Pattern combination:** TIDAL + ISLANDS + GEOLOGICAL
- **R5 findings tested:** N1-N4 (nesting -- does ambient context violate stack-not-nest?), G2 (container signal), R2 (mood -- reverent as frame)
- **Key question:** Can essence flow as continuous tidal substrate under dense task islands?
- **Risk:** "Background" implies z-layering, which conflicts with ANTI-PHYSICAL identity. Must reframe as TIDAL persistent thread, not z-layered background. Cross-stage analyst flagged this as vague -- needs careful reframing in Phase 0.
- **IMPORTANT:** This exploration must NOT interpret "background" as physical depth. The flat 2D identity requires Essence to be a STRUCTURAL persistent element, not a visual layer beneath other components.

### CD-005: All Callouts as Conversation
- **Content scenario:** How callout components create conversational flow
- **Pattern combination:** PULSE + Z-PATTERN
- **R5 findings tested:** T3 (temperature flow), T4 (2-callout limit -- directly challenges it), A1 (callout cacophony), R3 (voices in sequence)
- **Key question:** Does a carefully temperature-sequenced callout series still cause sidebar fatigue? Can the 2-callout limit be exceeded with intentional temperature management?
- **Risk:** Cross-stage analyst flagged this as potentially REDUNDANT with OD-001 (Conversational, 37/40), which already explored Q&A as PULSE. CD-005 is only valid if it tests something OD-001 didn't: specifically, whether a page composed ENTIRELY of callout components can sustain reader engagement. The cross-stage analyst recommended replacing this with a Multi-Axis Transition page, which would be a harder and more valuable test.
- **RECOMMENDATION FROM RESEARCH:** Consider replacing CD-005 with "Multi-Axis Transition" -- a single page transitioning through 3+ axis patterns (Z -> F -> Bento) with documented transition grammar. This directly tests AD-F-025 at maximum scale.

### CD-006: Creative (Crown Jewel)
- **Content scenario:** Compound combination -- all patterns active
- **Pattern combination:** ALL (FRACTAL meta-structure)
- **R5 findings tested:** Could test recipes, quantitative guidelines, and compatibility matrix at full scale
- **Key question:** Does the 3-way equivalence hold at maximum combination stress? Does component chemistry at compound scale maintain attention topology?
- **Risk:** This is not just the CD crown jewel -- it's the PIPELINE crown jewel. CD-006 should be the most ambitious exploration in the entire 5-stage pipeline. It should receive 30-40% of the research budget (following DD-006, OD-006, AD-006 precedent).
- **Target score:** 39-40/40 (continuing the progression: DD-006=36, OD-006=37, AD-006=38)

---

## 4. CD'S UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION

### 4.1 What CD Adds That Prior Stages Didn't

DD asked "what rhythms exist?" OD asked "how should information be structured?" AD asked "where should content be positioned?" CD asks the synthesis question: **"What happens when validated patterns from all three dimensions operate simultaneously?"**

This is fundamentally different from DD/OD/AD:
- DD/OD/AD each explored ONE dimension and discovered unification with prior dimensions
- CD explores MULTIPLE dimensions simultaneously and tests whether that unification holds
- DD/OD/AD elevated constraints to identities (DD-F-010 -> OD-F-005 -> AD-F-004)
- CD either VALIDATES the 3-way identity as terminal or discovers a 4th dimension

### 4.2 The "Component Chemistry" Concept

R5 establishes that components have three measurable behavioral properties -- **velocity** (reading speed), **temperature** (emotional register), and **weight** (cognitive load) -- that govern combination chemistry. These are not decorative metadata; they are the dimensions determining whether adjacent components create rhythm or monotony, harmony or collision.

The chemistry operates through:
- **Family DNA:** Shared structural elements (callout family's 2-zone + 4px border)
- **Functional contrast:** High-contrast pairings that feel harmonious (Code + Essence, File Tree + Decision Matrix)
- **Setup-Payoff arcs:** Component sequences following Context -> Map -> Principle -> Demo -> Action -> Hazards
- **Moods and voices:** 11 components have distinct emotional valences and speaking registers
- **Kinship model:** Siblings (same family), Parent-Child (composites), Cousins (cross-family shared traits)

### 4.3 Why This Matters

Component chemistry is the bridge between abstract patterns and real documentation pages. DD/OD/AD validated patterns in isolation. Migration will apply patterns to real content. CD validates the **translation layer** -- the rules for how abstract patterns manifest through concrete component combinations. Without CD, Migration would have to guess at combination rules.

### 4.4 The Likely Discovery

Based on the elevation pattern (each stage elevates a constraint to an identity), CD's most likely discovery is one of:
1. **Combination IS attention topology** -- combination doesn't add a new dimension; it confirms that attention topology is the complete and final model
2. **Combination reveals combination grammar** -- formal rules for composing attention topologies, analogous to how grammar composes words into sentences
3. **Combination reveals a density ceiling** -- an absolute limit beyond which no composition quality can prevent overwhelm

Option 2 (combination grammar) seems most likely given that AD already produced transition grammar (AD-F-025). CD would extend this from transitions-between-patterns to grammar-of-pattern-composition.

## 5. R5 COMBINATION THEORY -- WHAT MUST BE VALIDATED

### 5.1 The 39 Findings Organized by Tier

| Tier | Type | Findings | Count | CD Priority |
|------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Binary Rules (testable) | T2 velocity, T3 temperature, T4 2-callout limit, G3 weight balance, N1 stack-not-nest, N4 depth limit | 6 | HIGHEST -- empirically validate first |
| 2 | Patterns (demonstrable) | S1 setup-payoff, S5 teaching moment, Recipes 1-6, G4 advisory cluster | 9 | HIGH -- build each at least once |
| 3 | Frameworks (interpretive) | R1 kinship, R2 moods, R3 voices, H1-H4 harmony | 7 | MEDIUM -- harder to test definitively |
| 4 | Reference (lookup) | Q1-Q3 quantitative, Compatibility Matrix, A1-A7 anti-patterns | 11 | ONGOING -- check against all explorations |
| 5 | Guidance (soft) | S2-S4, G1-G2, N2-N3 | 6 | BACKGROUND -- apply as applicable |

### 5.2 Findings Likely to Hold

- **T2 (velocity mismatch rule):** SLOW + SLOW is demonstrably monotonous in all prior stages. Will hold.
- **T4 (2-callout limit):** Confirmed by DD-F-014 and inherited by all stages. Will hold UNLESS CD-005 demonstrates intentional temperature sequencing as a valid exception.
- **N1 (stack don't nest):** The flat 2D identity (ANTI-PHYSICAL) reinforces this. Components can't nest because nesting implies depth. Will hold absolutely.
- **Recipes 1-6:** These are straightforward compositions of already-validated components. Will work.

### 5.3 Findings That Might Surprise

- **T3 (temperature flow):** The Warm->Cold->Neutral taxonomy has **terminology mismatches** between R5 and combination-rules.md. R5 uses Cold/Neutral/Warm (3-tier); combination-rules.md hybridizes with R2 moods (Reverent, Utilitarian, Deliberate). CD must resolve which taxonomy is authoritative before validation.
- **S1 (setup-payoff arc):** Assumes LINEAR vertical reading. AD's non-linear patterns (Bento grid, Spiral) may require the arc to be spatially distributed rather than vertically sequenced. CD must test whether the arc adapts to 2D layouts.
- **Compatibility matrix:** The 11x11 Yes/OK/No matrix has NEVER been empirically tested. Some "No" ratings may prove acceptable with proper transition grammar.
- **N4 (depth limit):** R5 says maximum depth is 1 level. But Core Abstraction (Essence + Code) is already a composite. Can CD combine a composite WITHIN a combination without exceeding the depth limit?

### 5.4 Gaps CD Must Fill (from R5 analysis)

10 identified gaps where R5 has no guidance:

1. **No multi-axis combination theory** -- R5 assumes vertical stacking only
2. **No responsive combination rules** -- spacing values are static across viewports
3. **No animation/transition combination theory** -- static placement only
4. **No cross-page combination theory** -- within-page only
5. **No absolute component density ceiling** -- maximums per page length, not absolute overwhelm threshold
6. **No partial-component interaction theory** -- components treated as atomic
7. **No reader expertise modifier** -- rules presented as universal
8. **No voice sequencing beyond pairs** -- 5+ component voice arcs unexplored
9. **Incomplete Gotcha placement semantics** -- when productive vs anxiety-inducing
10. **No data-heavy combination rules** -- examples use conceptual content only

### 5.5 R5 + AD Interaction: The Frontier

R5 assumes linear vertical flow. AD proved non-linear layouts work. The intersection -- **non-linear combination choreography** -- is unexplored territory:

- Do R5's combination rules apply WITHIN Bento grid cells?
- If Bento places Code adjacent to Reasoning (both Heavy, both SLOW), does this violate R5-G3 (weight balance) and R5-T2 (velocity mismatch)?
- Can the Setup-Payoff Arc be spatially distributed across a Bento grid?
- Do R5's temperature buffers work as transition grammar between AD's axis patterns?

CD is uniquely positioned to discover these answers.

## 6. MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS FROM PRIOR STAGES

These are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Any combination violating these is INVALID.

### 6.1 Soul Rules (5 pieces, LOCKED)

| # | Rule | Implementation | Violation Count (all stages) |
|---|------|---------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | Sharp Edges Command Authority | `border-radius: 0` | 0 |
| 2 | The Archivist Speaks in Serif | Instrument Serif italic for Essence/CoreAbstraction | 0 |
| 3 | Callouts Share Family DNA | 2-zone + 4px left border + color differentiation | 0 |
| 4 | Shadows Lie About Depth | `box-shadow: none` | 0 |
| 5 | Squares Signal System | `border-radius: 0` on indicators | 0 |

### 6.2 Sequential, Not Simultaneous (AD-F-024)

Multiple axis patterns within a single viewport create visual cacophony. Each section commits to ONE axis pattern; compound effect emerges from the SEQUENCE of sections through scrolling time. Patterns layer through scrolling, following musical structure.

**CD enforcement:** No CD exploration may place two axis patterns in the same viewport. Combination is temporal/spatial, never superimposed.

### 6.3 Transition Grammar (AD-F-025)

Every transition between pattern zones must follow the 5x5 grammar:
- Smooth transitions: no intermediary needed
- Bridge transitions: require neutral component or breathing space
- Breathing transitions: require 48px+ gap plus visual signal

Choreography is the universal bridge; Spiral is the most isolated.

### 6.4 Density Tolerance (DD-F-013, CD Gate)

Before CD can build combinations, it must classify each component's density tolerance:
- **High tolerance** (compress well): Code blocks, tables, data displays
- **Low tolerance** (need breathing room): Essence callouts, CoreAbstraction, blockquotes
- **Rule:** Don't pack low-tolerance components into high-density zones

### 6.5 Fractal Self-Similarity (DD-F-006, 5-Scale Limit per AD-F-028)

Every combination must maintain the same rhythm at all 5 scales:
1. Navigation (pattern echo grids, landmarks)
2. Page (sparse-to-dense section progression)
3. Section (header -> body -> callout)
4. Component (label sparse + body dense)
5. Character (Instrument Serif sparse vs Inter dense vs JetBrains Mono code)

No 6th scale exists. CD should verify existing 5 hold, not seek a 6th.

### 6.6 Callout Limit (DD-F-014 / R5-T4)

Maximum 2 callouts visible simultaneously in any viewport. Density is not license to stack callouts. CD-005 is the only exploration permitted to deliberately test this boundary.

### 6.7 ANTI-PHYSICAL Identity

Binary pre-filter for ALL proposed combination techniques:
- Does it create perceived depth? -> FAIL
- Does an offset move? -> FAIL
- Does it simulate 3D physical space? -> FAIL
- `opacity === 1.0` on all visual elements, no exceptions
- Static solid offset = flat graphic (PASS)

### 6.8 Mode-Transition Breathing (OD-F-007)

Every organizational mode transition requires:
- 48px+ breathing zone
- Visual signal (divider, header, or mode indicator)
- This is arguably CD's MOST CRITICAL inherited constraint since CD's entire purpose is combining patterns

### 6.9 Organization IS Density (OD-F-005 / OD-F-MP-001)

When CD combines organizational patterns, it simultaneously combines density signatures. A conversational section adjacent to a narrative section creates a PULSE-to-CRESCENDO transition. Organization and density CANNOT be treated as separate layers.

## 7. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR CD

### From HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md (5 original)

| # | Question | Assigned To | Priority | Expected Answer |
|---|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Combination density tolerance:** When two axis patterns combine, does the combined component absorb both density patterns or require splitting? | CD-001, CD-003 | CRITICAL (gate finding) | Likely: components maintain individual tolerance; combination adds transition cost but doesn't change intrinsic tolerance |
| 2 | **Transition grammar scaling:** Does AD-F-025 grammar hold between separate combined pages? | CD-005 (or revised Multi-Axis Transition) | HIGH | Likely: grammar holds but requires additional inter-page conventions (consistent header landmarks) |
| 3 | **Attention topology composition:** How do attention topologies compose with multiple patterns on same page? | CD-006 | HIGH | The frontier question -- most likely to produce novel CD-F findings |
| 4 | **Sequential vs parallel combinations:** Are there genuinely parallel combination patterns? | CD-002, CD-004 | MEDIUM | Likely NO based on AD-F-024. Parallel = cacophony. But TIDAL substrate (CD-004) may be the exception |
| 5 | **Fractal at combination scale:** Does combination create a 6th scale? | CD-006 | MEDIUM | Likely NO per AD-F-028. 5 is the hard limit. Combination operates WITHIN scales, not as a new scale |

### New Questions from Research (4 additional)

| # | Question | Source | Priority |
|---|----------|--------|----------|
| 6 | Do the 4 combination rules (velocity, temperature, weight, spacing) hold under ALL axis-density pairings? | R5 deep-read | HIGH |
| 7 | Does the component compatibility matrix change depending on which organizational pattern is active? | R5 deep-read | MEDIUM |
| 8 | Can component recipes be composed (Recipe 1 inside Recipe 3) without violating stacking-not-nesting? | R5 deep-read | MEDIUM |
| 9 | What NEW anti-patterns emerge from combination that don't exist in isolation? | Cross-stage analysis | HIGH -- may be CD's most valuable empirical contribution |

### Ranked by Importance

1. **Q1 (density tolerance)** -- Gate finding. Must answer before building.
2. **Q3 (topology composition)** -- Most likely to produce novel discoveries.
3. **Q9 (new anti-patterns)** -- Highest empirical value for Migration.
4. **Q6 (combination rules universality)** -- Validates R5 theory.
5. **Q2 (grammar scaling)** -- Structural foundation for multi-page sites.
6. **Q7 (context-dependent compatibility)** -- Refines the compatibility matrix.
7. **Q4 (sequential vs parallel)** -- Already mostly answered by AD-F-024.
8. **Q8 (recipe composition)** -- Edge case but Migration will need this.
9. **Q5 (6th fractal scale)** -- Already mostly answered by AD-F-028.

## 8. PROVENANCE DELIVERABLES

### 8.1 Files CD Must Create

| File | Location | Expected Size | Purpose |

| CLAUDE.md (update) | stage-5-combination-cd/ | Existing placeholder | Full navigation guide |

### 8.2 Files CD Must Update

| File | What to Update |
|------|---------------|
| PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md | Section B (CD-F entries), Section D (Combination Patterns table), Section F (lifecycle counts), Document Metadata |
| BACKBONE.md | Section 6 (full CD story), Section 7 (research chain), Section 8 (generated research flow), Section 9 (soul matrix), Section 10 (causal chain), Section 13 (R3-023 trace) |

### 8.3 Finding Format

```markdown
### CD-F-NNN: [Title]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | CD-F-NNN |
| **Title** | [Descriptive title] |
| **Source** | CD-NNN ([Exploration Name]) |
| **Severity** | [N/A / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL] |
| **Classification** | Class [A/B/C/D] |
| **Description** | [Full description with provenance citations] |
| **Evidence** | [Specific CSS/HTML evidence] |
```

Classification: Class A = confirming (binary), Class B = extending (judgment), Class C = overwriting (contradicts prior), Class D = breaking (identity break). Target: ~50% A, ~50% B, 0% C, 0% D.

### 8.4 ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 Requirements

v3 MUST contain everything from v2 PLUS:
- All CD-F-### findings and lesson chains
- Component density tolerance test results (DD-F-013 gate answer)
- Transition grammar refinements from combination contexts
- R-5 consumption record (from ~5% to target ~80%+)
- Combination-scale attention topology description
- Sequential vs parallel determination
- Whether a 6th fractal scale exists (expected: no)
- Any new anti-patterns discovered through combination
- Updated pipeline position showing CD COMPLETE

### 8.5 Provenance Must Be Incremental

HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md explicitly requires: "I will create provenance INCREMENTALLY during build, not after." Findings must be documented as discovered, not retroactively batch-written. OD's deferred provenance caused a 18-agent remediation crisis (OD-F-005 collision). CD must not repeat this.

---

## 9. TEAM EXECUTION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 9.1 Team Topology (~18-20 agents)

Based on what worked in AD (25 agents, 5 phases, flat-per-phase) and adjusted for CD's lighter scope:

| Phase | Agents | Duration (est.) | Key Tasks |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Phase 0: Convention + Research | 4 | ~30 min | Convention Extender (sections 17-20), R-5 Evaluator (39 findings), Research Packager (EXT-CD-*), Convention Auditor |
| Phase 1A: CD-001 + CD-002 | 3 | ~45 min | 2 builders + scribe |
| Phase 1B: CD-003 + CD-004 | 3 | ~45 min | 2 builders + scribe |
| Phase 1C: CD-005 + CD-006 | 3 | ~60 min | 2 builders + scribe (CD-006 gets extra time) |
| Phase 2: Audit | 5 | ~45 min | Visual, structural, fresh-eyes, provenance, synthesizer |
| Phase 3: Fix | 2-4 | ~25 min | Per-file fixers (AD lesson: per-file ownership eliminates contention) |
| Phase 4: Synthesis + Handoff | 3 | ~30 min | Synthesizer, identity scribe (v3), infrastructure updater |
| Weaver (persistent) | 1 | Full session | Tracks state, cross-references, maintains coherence |

**Total: ~18-20 agents, ~4-5 hours wall time** (vs AD's ~25 agents, ~5-6 hours)

### 9.2 Convention Spec Approach

**CRITICAL LESSON from OD/AD:** Convention spec BEFORE building.

- OD built without conventions -> 3 dialects -> 43-agent remediation
- AD created convention spec in Phase 0 -> zero dialect divergence

CD must:
1. Inherit AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md sections 1-16 unchanged
2. Add 4 CD-specific sections in Phase 0:
   - Section 17: Combination Rules (how pattern combinations are structured in HTML/CSS)
   - Section 18: Transition Grammar Extension (AD-F-025 extended for multi-pattern pages)
   - Section 19: Component Density Tolerance Table (DD-F-013 operationalized per component pair)
   - Section 20: Combination Accessibility Requirements

### 9.3 Build Pattern

Consider **2-wave build** instead of 3-wave:
- Wave 1: CD-001/002/003 (simpler combinations)
- Wave 2: CD-004/005/006 (complex combinations + crown jewel)

Rationale: CD's patterns are COMBINATIONS of already-built patterns. Each exploration is about COMPOSITION, not creation. This saves ~1 hour and ~3 agents.

### 9.4 Audit Approach

**Lighter audit, heavier synthesis.** CD's patterns are combinations of already-audited patterns. Focus audit on:
- Soul compliance (always full, binary check)
- Combination-specific failures (transition grammar violations, density tolerance breaks)
- Combination coherence (new for CD -- do the combined patterns feel unified?)
- Convention spec compliance (sections 17-20 are new)

But SYNTHESIS should be the most comprehensive in the pipeline, because it closes the chain.

### 9.5 Research Model

Commission EXT-CD-* bespoke research during Phase 0:
- Combination layout patterns
- Multi-axis co-existence strategies
- Transition grammar extensions
- Component density tolerance testing

Target ~15-20 EXT-CD-* findings (vs OD's 94 and AD's 33). R-5 is already combination-focused, so less bespoke research is needed.

### 9.6 Key Process Lessons from Prior Teams

| Lesson | Source | CD Application |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Convention before building | OD (3 dialects) / AD (0 dialects) | Phase 0 convention spec is non-negotiable |

## 10. HOW CD DIFFERS FROM ORIGINAL PLAN

This is the most valuable section -- it captures what the research reveals should CHANGE about the original CD plan.

### 10.1 Reframe from "Component Chemistry" to "Pattern Combination Stress Test"

The current framing (STAGE-HEADER.md, CLAUDE.md) describes CD as "component chemistry -- how components WORK TOGETHER." This is too close to a component library integration test. After the 3-way unification discovery (AD-F-004/AD-F-023), CD must test whether ATTENTION TOPOLOGY is robust under combination.

**New framing:** Each CD exploration combines 2-3 validated patterns from DD/OD/AD and asks: "Does the attention topology equivalence hold, extend, or break?"

### 10.2 Add Explicit Pattern-Combination Mappings

**Original plan:** CD-001 = "Reasoning Inside Code" (content scenario only)
**Required:** CD-001 = "Reasoning Inside Code" + F-PATTERN + BENTO + CRESCENDO (explicit pattern combination)

Every CD exploration MUST declare which DD density, OD organizational, and AD axis patterns it combines. Without this, builders will treat explorations as content design exercises rather than pattern combination experiments.

### 10.3 Operationalize DD-F-013 as Phase 0 Deliverable

DD-F-013 (component density tolerance) is the gate finding. The original plan doesn't include a DENSITY TOLERANCE TABLE. Phase 0 must produce one:

| Component | High Density | Low Density | Combination Constraint |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Code block | HIGH (compresses well) | -- | Can pack into dense zones |
| Essence | -- | HIGH (needs breathing room) | Must NOT be in dense zones |
| Q&A pair | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Width determines density |
| Task cluster | HIGH (collapses via details) | -- | Interactive mode relieves density |
| File tree | MEDIUM | -- | Depth determines density |

### 10.4 Resolve R5 Terminology Discrepancies BEFORE Building

The R5 deep-read revealed terminology mismatches between R5 and combination-rules.md:
- R5 uses Warm/Neutral/Cold (3-tier temperature)
- combination-rules.md hybridizes with R2 moods (Reverent, Utilitarian, Deliberate)

Phase 0 must resolve which taxonomy is authoritative. Recommendation: use R5's 3-tier for RULES (binary), R2's moods for FRAMEWORKS (interpretive). Document this in CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md Section 17.

### 10.5 Consider Replacing CD-005

Cross-stage analysis flagged CD-005 (All Callouts as Conversation) as potentially redundant with OD-001. Consider replacing with "Multi-Axis Transition" -- a page testing AD-F-025 transition grammar across 3+ axis patterns. This is a harder, more valuable test.

**Counter-argument:** CD-005 tests the R5-T4 boundary (2-callout limit). If the team keeps CD-005, it must explicitly test something OD-001 didn't -- specifically, whether pure-callout composition sustains engagement.

### 10.6 CD-006 Gets 30-40% of Research Budget

Following DD-006/OD-006/AD-006 precedent, the crown jewel gets disproportionate investment. CD-006 should demonstrate all 6 density patterns, all 6 organizational patterns (or references), and the 3-way equivalence under maximum stress. Plan from Phase 0.

### 10.7 Produce HANDOFF-CD-TO-MIGRATION.md (Not Just a Completion Certificate)

Cross-stage analyst debated whether CD needs a handoff document since Migration reads the full chain. Recommendation: YES, produce HANDOFF-CD-TO-MIGRATION.md. It serves as:
- Confirmation that the pattern vocabulary is complete
- CD-F findings summary
- Whether the 3-way equivalence held
- PATTERN SELECTION GUIDE for Migration ("given content type X, use combination Y")
- What ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 contains vs v2

### 10.8 Lighter Audit, Heavier Synthesis

CD's audit can be lighter than AD's multi-dimensional 24-agent audit because CD combines already-audited patterns. Soul compliance + combination coherence + convention sections 17-20 is sufficient. But CD-SYNTHESIS.md should be the most comprehensive synthesis in the pipeline -- it closes the chain and informs Migration.

## 11. WHAT TO EXPECT -- SCOPE AND SCALE

### 11.1 Estimated Outputs

| Output Type | Estimated Count | Basis |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| HTML explorations | 6 | Same as DD/OD/AD |
| CD-F findings | 15-25 | DD:18, OD:17, AD:28; CD is terminal so expect slightly fewer novel discoveries |
| Formal chain documents | 8-10 | outbound-findings, synthesis, audit-synthesis, convention-spec, research-gate, handoff, stage-header, CLAUDE.md, identity-v3 |
| R-5 findings evaluated | 39 (all) | PRIMARY research source |
| EXT-CD-* bespoke findings | 15-20 | Lower than OD (94) and AD (33); R-5 is already combination-focused |
| Score target | >= 32/40 per exploration, >= 35/40 average | Maintaining ascending quality trajectory |
| Crown jewel target | 39-40/40 | DD-006=36, OD-006=37, AD-006=38 |
| Soul violations | 0 | Non-negotiable |

### 11.2 Estimated Effort

| Phase | Wall Time | Agents | Files Produced |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Phase 0 | ~30 min | 4 | Convention spec, research gate, density tolerance table |
| Phase 1 (build) | ~2-2.5 hours | 6-9 | 6 HTML explorations + finding drafts |
| Phase 2 (audit) | ~45 min | 5 | Audit reports |
| Phase 3 (fix) | ~25 min | 2-4 | Fixed explorations |
| Phase 4 (synthesis) | ~45 min | 3 | Synthesis, identity-v3, infrastructure updates |
| **Total** | **~4-5 hours** | **~18-20** | **~25-35 files** |

### 11.3 Realistic Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| CD-005 redundancy with OD-001 | HIGH | MEDIUM | Replace with Multi-Axis Transition or reframe sharply |
| CD-004 "background" violates ANTI-PHYSICAL | MEDIUM | HIGH | Reframe as "ambient tidal thread" in Phase 0 |
| R5 terminology confusion during build | HIGH | MEDIUM | Resolve in Phase 0 convention spec |
| Density tolerance table omitted | MEDIUM | HIGH | Make it a Phase 0 gate deliverable |
| Crown jewel (CD-006) under-invested | LOW | HIGH | Allocate 30-40% budget from Phase 0 |
| Provenance deferred to post-build | MEDIUM | HIGH | Mandatory incremental provenance (binary rule) |

## 12. CROSS-STAGE PATTERN ANALYSIS

### 12.1 The Big Question

Does CD establish a **4-way equivalence** (adding combination as a 4th dimension)? Or does it test whether the existing **3-way equivalence** (axis = organization = density) holds under combination stress?

### 12.2 The Evidence Strongly Suggests: CD Tests the 3-Way

**Arguments:**

1. **AD-F-023 (Attention Topology)** is already at the HIGHEST abstraction level. There is no obvious 4th dimension -- combination is a MODE of the existing 3, not a new dimension.

2. **AD-F-028 (5-scale bound):** If combination created a new dimension, we'd expect a new fractal scale. AD explicitly tested for a 6th and found none.

3. **AD-F-024 (compound is sequential):** Combination creates temporal/spatial sequences of existing patterns, not parallel superposition. This is RECOMBINATION, not new emergence.

4. **The handoff framing itself:** "test whether COMBINATIONS of these validated patterns maintain the equivalence or reveal new dynamics." The word "maintain" comes first.

### 12.3 The Likely Answer

CD will most likely discover that:

1. **The 3-way equivalence HOLDS** under combination. Attention topology is the terminal meta-concept.

2. **Combination reveals COMPOSITION RULES** -- formal grammar for how attention topologies compose, extending AD-F-025's transition grammar from pattern-transitions to pattern-compositions. This is the CD analogue of OD's "Organization IS Density" and AD's "Axis IS Density IS Organization."

3. **The correct CD elevation statement** will be something like: "**Combination is the GRAMMAR of attention topology**" -- density is vocabulary, organization is syntax, axis is geometry, combination is grammar. The grammar doesn't add a new dimension; it provides rules for composing the existing dimensions.

4. **No 6th fractal scale** will be found. Combination operates WITHIN the existing 5 scales, not as a new scale.

### 12.4 What Would Surprise

- If a genuinely parallel (non-sequential) combination pattern is found that doesn't create cacophony, it would challenge AD-F-024 and potentially reveal a new dimension
- If the 2-callout limit breaks under intentional temperature management (CD-005), it would show that R5's binary rules have interaction effects
- If combination reveals that the compatibility matrix is context-dependent (changes per organizational pattern), it would show that R5's rules are less universal than claimed

### 12.5 Score Progression Trajectory

| Stage | Avg Score | Crown Jewel | Finding Count | Quality Trend |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| DD | 34.5/40 | 36/40 | 18 | Baseline |
| OD (v3) | ~35.5/40 | 37/40 | 17 | +1.0 avg |
| AD | 36.2/40 | 38/40 | 28 | +0.7 avg |
| **CD (target)** | **>=35/40** | **39-40/40** | **15-25** | **Maintain or +0.3 avg** |

The ascending trajectory should continue, though the ceiling effect means smaller gains. The crown jewel progression (36->37->38->39?) should be a design target.

### 12.6 The 4-Stage Pipeline Story (Complete)

```
DD: "What rhythms exist?"           -> 6 density patterns     -> VOCABULARY
OD: "How should info be structured?" -> 6 org patterns         -> SYNTAX
AD: "Where should content sit?"      -> 6 axis patterns        -> GEOMETRY
CD: "What happens in combination?"   -> combination rules      -> GRAMMAR
                                        |
                                        v
                              ATTENTION TOPOLOGY
                            (unified meta-concept)
                                        |
                                        v
                                  MIGRATION
                         (real documentation pages)
```

CD completes the circle. After CD, the system has vocabulary (density), syntax (organization), geometry (axis), and grammar (combination). Migration applies the complete language to real content.

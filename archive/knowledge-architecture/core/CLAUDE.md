# knowledge-architecture — CLAUDE.md

## STATUS: ACTIVE — SEMANTIC MAPPING LAYER

This folder contains the meta-documentation for the KORTAI design system's knowledge architecture — the maps, registries, and analyses that explain how the system connects together.

## What This Folder Contains

Core documents about the design system's **provenance chain**, including:
- **Phase 1B Mega Debrief** — Complete analysis of 463 file connections
- **Pipeline Backbone** — The Research -> T1 -> DD -> OD -> AD -> CD flow
- **Source of Truth Registry** — What's authoritative for what
- **KA Decision Documents** — Why we structured things this way
- **OD Granular Audit Results** — 89 findings from 17-agent adversarial audit
- **Workflow Metacognition Analysis** — Deep analysis of agent team workflows
- **OD Audit Retrospective and Protocol v3** — Lessons learned and protocol evolution
- **OD Fix Execution Prompt** — Agent team prompt for fix execution phase
- **Provenance Chain Remediation Handoff** — Handoff for provenance gap remediation
- **Provenance Comprehension Prompt** — Agent team prompt for chain analysis
- **Provenance Remediation Plan Prompt** — Agent team prompt for plan revision

Subdirectories with working artifacts:
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/` — 22 files from 17-agent audit (per-agent reports, screenshots)
- `_provenance-gap-analysis/` — Gap analysis and remediation artifacts
- `_provenance-deep-dive/` — 9 files from deep provenance analysis teams
- `_workflow-metacognition/` — 9 files from workflow analysis agents
- `_remediation/` — Remediation execution artifacts

This is where you go to understand the SYSTEM, not the DESIGN.

**Provenance architecture:** 3-layer system — inline threading headers (490 files), light sections (244 files), and formal chain documents (in DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/).

## Why This Exists

After completing T1 synthesis and DD explorations, we needed to document:
1. How everything connects (provenance chain)
2. What depends on what (threading)
3. What's authoritative (source of truth)
4. How to navigate (pipeline)

The Phase 1B Mega Debrief proved the system is real — 76% of files connect to T1, zero broken references, zero circular dependencies.

## Pipeline Position

```
Research → T1 → DD → OD → AD → CD
                              ↑
                    [KNOWLEDGE ARCHITECTURE]
                    (Documents the entire pipeline)
```

This folder sits OUTSIDE the pipeline — it documents the pipeline itself.

## Constraints (Read Before Modifying Anything)

- **DO NOT modify threading data manually** — It was generated by analysis
- **DO NOT add files without considering SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-REGISTRY.md**
- **DO NOT contradict PIPELINE-BACKBONE.md** — It's the master narrative
- **Treat the Phase 1B debrief as historical record** — Don't update it for new work

## Key Files (Start Here)

| File | Purpose | Inbound Refs |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `PHASE-1B-MEGA-DEBRIEF.md` | Complete analysis of 463 connections, 76% T1 reachability | 10+ |

| `SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-REGISTRY.md` | Declares what's authoritative for what | 8+ |
| `KA-DECISIONS.md` | Why we made architectural choices | 5+ |
| `KA-POSITION.md` | Current position in pipeline | 3+ |
| `KA-VERIFICATION.md` | Verification procedures | 3+ |

## What You'll Find Here

| Item | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `PHASE-1B-MEGA-DEBRIEF.md` | File | Complete debrief of Phase 1B dependency analysis |
| `PIPELINE-BACKBONE.md` | File | Master pipeline narrative (12 essential files, 3-phase read order) |

Note: `dependency-trace/` is a sibling directory at `../dependency-trace/`, not inside this folder.

## Where To Go Next

| If You Want To... | Go To |
|-------------------|-------|
| Understand how files connect | `PHASE-1B-MEGA-DEBRIEF.md` |
| See the pipeline stages | `PIPELINE-BACKBONE.md` |
| Know what's authoritative | `SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-REGISTRY.md` |
| Find file classifications | `../dependency-trace/PHASE-2A-CLASSIFICATION.md` |
| See threading data | `../dependency-trace/02-threading-data/` |
| Understand architectural decisions | `KA-DECISIONS.md` |

## Upstream Sources

- `design-extraction/component-system/perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/` — T1 files that this folder documents
- `../research/` — Research findings referenced in pipeline
- `../explorations/` — DD work documented in pipeline

## Downstream Consumers

- **All future work** — Any Claude instance should read PIPELINE-BACKBONE.md first
- `../DESIGN-SYSTEM/` — Public docs reference the pipeline
- Context recovery — This folder enables resumption after compaction

## For Context Recovery

**Phase 1B status:** COMPLETE (463 files traced, 76% T1 reachable)
**Phase 2A status:** Part 1 COMPLETE, Part 2 COMPLETE, Part 3 COMPLETE
**What to check:** `../dependency-trace/PHASE-2A-CLASSIFICATION.md` for current state
**OD Provenance Chain Remediation:** COMPLETE (94/104 verification items pass, 17 OD-F findings, 47 EXT-* findings)
**Read first:** `PIPELINE-BACKBONE.md` to understand where you are

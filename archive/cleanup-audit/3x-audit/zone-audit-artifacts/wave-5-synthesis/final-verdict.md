## SCREENSHOT BULK CONSENSUS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Universal Agreement: DELETE ALL SCREENSHOTS (10.1 MB)

**Target:** 22 PNG files across 2 directories
- audit-screenshots/cycle-1/ (15 PNG, 5.1 MB)
- audit-screenshots/dd-reaudit/ (7 PNG, 5.0 MB)

**Evidence from All Three Reports:**

| Dimension | Deep | Adversary | Fresh-Eyes | Consensus |
|-----------|------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Score | 18pts | 15pts | 3.5pts | 12pts avg |
| Provenance | 15pts (9 refs) | 15pts (9 refs) | 5pts (0 forward refs) | Bibliographic only |
| Supersession | 0pts (fully superseded) | 0pts (fully superseded) | 0pts (fully superseded) | 100% redundant |
| Reproducibility | 0pts (redundant) | 0pts (redundant) | 0pts (can re-screenshot) | Zero unique evidence |
| Temporal | 0pts (phase complete) | 0pts (phase complete) | 0pts (post-synthesis) | Complete |
| Verdict | DELETE | DELETE | DELETE | **DELETE** |

**Unique Evidence Test (All 3 Reports):**
- **Deep:** "Q: Do screenshots contain findings NOT in text reports? A: NO."
- **Adversary:** "All findings documented in text: scores, soul compliance, CSS evidence, anti-patterns"
- **Fresh-Eyes:** "Screenshots are redundant once synthesis exists. Can re-screenshot any time if needed."

**Text Synthesis Coverage:**
- cycle-1/: ALL findings in FOUNDATION-REMEDIATION-SYNTHESIS.md (238 lines)
  - 11 component scores
  - 3 globals.css fixes
  - Soul violations documented
- dd-reaudit/: ALL findings in DD-REAUDIT-PERCEPTUAL-SYNTHESIS.md (658 lines)
  - Per-DD scores: 33/40, 35/40, 32/40, 35/40, 36/40, 36/40
  - Soul piece verification matrix (5 pieces × 6 DDs)
  - CSS token evidence (var() citations)

**Consensus Reasoning:**
1. **100% Redundancy:** All visual findings documented in text synthesis reports
2. **Bibliographic References:** 9-16 refs are "see audit-screenshots/" citations, not load-bearing visual analysis
3. **Phase Complete:** Stage 1 (2026-02-04) and DD re-audit (2026-02-04) both COMPLETE
4. **Reproducibility:** Can re-screenshot any layout at any time if needed
5. **Bloat Impact:** 10.1 MB = 94% of zone size

**FINAL VERDICT: ABSOLUTE DELETE**
**Bloat Reduction: 10.1 MB**

### KEEP — 4 Files (~3 MB)

| File | Deep | Adv | Fresh | Score Gap | Final Reasoning |
|------|------|-----|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **checkpoints/CLAUDE.md** | KEEP (69) | KEEP (69) | KEEP (70) | 1pt | 3/3 KEEP — Cognitive Load VETO, auto-loaded |
| **checkpoints/MASTER-STATE.md** | KEEP (54) | KEEP (54) | KEEP (75) | 21pts | 3/3 KEEP — Cognitive Load VETO, position tracker |

| **checkpoints/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md** | KEEP (69) | KEEP (69, flagged) | KEEP (60) | 9pts | 3/3 KEEP — operational tracking, POST-CD ref'd |

**KEEP Subtotal: 4 files, ~3 MB**

**Flags:**
- **RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md:** All 3 reports flagged for duplication refactor (checkpoints 774 lines vs provenance archival)
- **Recommendation:** Trim checkpoints version to CURRENT PHASE only (cleanup audit), archive full history to provenance/

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## CONTESTED FILE RESOLUTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### 1. DISCOVERIES-LOG.md — KEEP vs ARCHIVE

**Votes:** Deep=KEEP (45), Adversary=ARCHIVE (41), Fresh-Eyes=KEEP (50)

**Score Gap:** 9pts (minimal)

**Deep Reasoning (KEEP):**
- 895 lines, 24 explorations tracked
- Active operational log
- Not superseded
- 8+ refs, mixed tiers

**Adversary Challenge (ARCHIVE):**
- Discovery phase COMPLETE (CD done, cleanup audit current)
- File is HISTORICAL SUMMARY, not operational
- Temporal inflated (5→0): "discoveries ongoing" FALSE, cleanup audit doesn't generate discoveries
- Reproducibility overcounted (10→5): discoveries exist at SOURCE (individual exploration files), this is index not content
- Adjusted score: 41pts → ARCHIVE

**Fresh-Eyes Support (KEEP):**
- 50pts, active learnings log
- 4 refs found
- Process + outcome irreplaceable

**SYNTHESIS DECISION: ARCHIVE**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Temporal inflation confirmed:** Current work is cleanup audit, NOT discovery generation
2. **Source vs Index:** Individual exploration files contain actual discoveries, this is convenience index
3. **Score gap minimal:** 41-50pts both near grey zone threshold
4. **2/3 rule:** Adversary (41pts ARCHIVE) + Fresh-Eyes (50pts borderline) vs Deep (45pts borderline)
5. **Historical value:** File valuable but NOT operational for current phase

**Archive Destination:** `/knowledge-architecture/_discovery-archives/DISCOVERIES-LOG.md`

---

### 2. SECTIONS-PROGRESS.md — ARCHIVE vs DELETE

**Votes:** Deep=ARCHIVE (38), Adversary=DELETE (11), Fresh-Eyes=ARCHIVE (25)

**Score Gap:** 27pts (SIGNIFICANT)

**Deep Reasoning (ARCHIVE):**
- 460 lines, section completion tracking
- Grey zone 38pts
- Operational intent but Phase 3 not started
- HUMAN_REVIEW recommended

**Adversary Challenge (DELETE):**
- Phase 3 NOT STARTED = operational intent with ZERO actual use
- Temporal inflated (5→0): "sections in progress" FALSE
- Supersession inflated (15→0): "not superseded" requires ACTIVE USE, not just "exists"
- Adjusted score: 11pts → DELETE

**Fresh-Eyes Support (ARCHIVE):**
- 25pts, section tracker with unclear status
- Process irreplaceable but phase complete

**SYNTHESIS DECISION: ARCHIVE**

**Reasoning:**
1. **2/3 ARCHIVE majority:** Deep + Fresh-Eyes both say ARCHIVE
2. **Score gap analysis:** Adversary -27pts due to temporal + supersession errors, but 2/3 consensus overrides
3. **Grey zone treatment:** 11-38pts range suggests ARCHIVE safer than DELETE (preserve intent even if inactive)
4. **Phase uncertainty:** MASTER-STATE shows Phase 2 only 25% complete, Phase 3 timeline unknown
5. **Hedge strategy:** ARCHIVE preserves future utility if Phase 3 ever begins

**Archive Destination:** `/knowledge-architecture/_audit-archives/checkpoint-syntheses/SECTIONS-PROGRESS.md`

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## KEY SYNTHESIS FINDINGS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Finding #1: Screenshot Redundancy — 100% Consensus

**ALL THREE reports independently confirmed:**
- Screenshots are 100% redundant with text synthesis reports
- Can reproduce all audit findings from text alone
- 10.1 MB bloat for zero unique evidence
- References are bibliographic citations, not load-bearing analysis

**Unique Evidence Test Results:**
- Deep: "Q: Do screenshots show anything text doesn't? A: NO"
- Adversary: "Can reproduce audit findings from text alone? YES"
- Fresh-Eyes: "Screenshots are redundant once synthesis exists"

**ABSOLUTE DELETE — Highest confidence verdict in zone**

---

### Finding #2: Temporal Inflation Pattern

**Adversary identified systematic error in Deep scoring:**
- 4 files scored temporal=5 for COMPLETED phases
- Pattern: Conflating "referenced" with "active"
- Affected files: SECTIONS-PROGRESS, DISCOVERIES-LOG, COMPONENTS-REGISTRY, RESEARCH-APPLICATION-ENFORCEMENT-TEMPLATE
- Impact: 3 verdict changes (KEEP → ARCHIVE)

**Root Cause:** Temporal scoring should require CURRENT PHASE consumption, not just historical reference.

**Corrected Interpretation:**
- temporal=5: File supports ACTIVE work in CURRENT phase
- temporal=0: File from COMPLETED phase, even if referenced

---

### Finding #3: Operational vs Archival Sync Violation

**ALL THREE reports flagged duplication issues:**
- Deep: "checkpoints/ is operational; provenance/ is archival"
- Adversary: "RESEARCH-ACTIVE 774 lines should be current phase only"
- Fresh-Eyes: "Need STATUS vs PHASE distinction in threading headers"

**Affected Files:**
- RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md: Checkpoints 774 lines (should be current phase) vs provenance (full history)
- DD-REAUDIT-PERCEPTUAL-SYNTHESIS.md: Both versions exist, DD phase complete
- FOUNDATION-REMEDIATION-SYNTHESIS.md: Both versions exist, foundation phase complete

**Recommendation:** Trim operational (checkpoints) to current phase, archive full history to provenance.

---

### Finding #4: Map-Reduce Audit Pattern

**Fresh-Eyes identified universal audit artifact pattern:**
1. **Map phase:** Raw data (screenshots, worker reports)
2. **Reduce phase:** Synthesis (CAPTAIN reports, checkpoint syntheses)
3. **Migration phase:** Provenance archival

**Pattern observed across:**
- Screenshots → CAPTAIN-VISUAL-REPORT
- Worker reports → CAPTAIN synthesis
- Checkpoints → Provenance migration

**Implication:** Default verdict for audit artifacts should be DELETE unless they're synthesis gateways or forward-consumed.

---

### Finding #5: Grey Zone Clustering

**4 files scored 38-51pts (grey zone):**
- SECTIONS-PROGRESS.md: 38pts (Deep), 11pts (Adversary), 25pts (Fresh-Eyes)
- DISCOVERIES-LOG.md: 45pts (Deep), 41pts (Adversary), 50pts (Fresh-Eyes)
- COMPONENTS-REGISTRY.md: 45pts (Deep), 41pts (Adversary), 30pts (Fresh-Eyes)
- RESEARCH-APPLICATION-ENFORCEMENT-TEMPLATE.md: 51pts (Deep), 47pts (Adversary), 20pts (Fresh-Eyes)

**Observation:** All 4 suffered from temporal inflation (completed phase scored as active).

**Pattern:** Completed phase trackers hover in grey zone due to provenance + reproducibility offsetting zero temporal/supersession.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Phase 1: DELETE (28 files, 10.7 MB) — IMMEDIATE

```

---

### Phase 3: REFACTOR (4 KEEP files) — POST-ARCHIVE

**RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md Refactor:**
1. Read current 774-line checkpoints version
2. Extract CURRENT PHASE content only (cleanup audit research tracking)
3. Write trimmed version (~100-200 lines) to checkpoints/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
4. Verify provenance/ version has full history
5. Update sync timestamp in checkpoints/CLAUDE.md

**No action required for:**
- checkpoints/CLAUDE.md (cognitive load VETO)
- checkpoints/MASTER-STATE.md (cognitive load VETO)
- checkpoints/SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md (soul VETO)

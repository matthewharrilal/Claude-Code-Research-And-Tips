# EXACT 1:1 REPLICATION PROGRESS

## Current Phase: 0 - EXHAUSTIVE CAPABILITY AUDIT
## Last Updated: 2026-02-02T00:00:00Z

---

## MISSION
Create documentation that is:
- **STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL** to Linear/Vercel docs (density, spacing, components, behavior)
- **VISUALLY IDENTICAL** to reference images (typography, colors, boldness, personality)

NOT "inspired by." NOT "similar to." EXACT MATCH on BOTH dimensions.

---

### Completed
- [x] Created PROGRESS.md tracking file
- [x] Analyzed reference images (initial pass):
  - **Image 1**: Blue background + white blackletter typography, candelabra motifs
  - **Image 2**: Sanrok red + cream, bold condensed + serif italic mix
  - **Image 3**: Red outline typography on white, character substitutions (4→A, Ø→O)

### In Progress
- [ ] Phase 5: Final validation and component refinement

### Phases 1-4 COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 1: EXACT Linear/Vercel structural extraction via Playwright
- [x] Phase 2: Reference image visual identity extraction
- [x] Phase 3: Design token synthesis (merged spec)
- [x] Phase 4: Built EXACT MATCH mockup at /poc/exact-match

### Phase 0 COMPLETE
- [x] Sub-Agent 0B: MCP Server Inventory - Playwright MCP available for screenshots
- [x] Sub-Agent 0C: Library Deep Scan - 17 searches complete
- [x] Sub-Agent 0D: Current Design System Analysis - 13 color conflicts found

### Next (Queue)
- Phase 1: Linear/Vercel EXACT Structural Extraction
- Phase 2: Reference Image EXACT Visual Extraction
- Phase 3: Merge Specifications
- Phase 4: Build EXACT Mockups
- Phase 5: Validation Against Both Targets

### Key Decisions
- (pending Phase 0 completion)

## EXACT MATCH CRITERIA

### Structural (Linear/Vercel):
- [ ] Sidebar width: [target px] = [actual px]
- [ ] Content max-width: [target px] = [actual px]
- [ ] Items per viewport: [target count] = [actual count]
- [ ] Spacing values: [all must match]
- [ ] All components present and functional
- [ ] Interactions identical

### Visual (Reference Images):
- [ ] Typography boldness: Match image confidence
- [ ] Color accuracy: Exact hex match
- [ ] Contrast level: HIGH (matches images)

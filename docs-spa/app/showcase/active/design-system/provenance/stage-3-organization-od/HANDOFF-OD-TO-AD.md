# HANDOFF: OD → AD
## AD Reads This FIRST at Phase 0

===============================================================================
## PURPOSE
===============================================================================

This document transfers everything AD needs from OD's re-enriched state. OD
completed 3 phases: original build (6 explorations), 17-agent adversarial audit
(89 findings), and 43-agent gate-based re-enrichment (42 new EXT-* findings,
convention unification, all 6 ODs elevated to v3). The v3 state is authoritative.

===============================================================================
## ACKNOWLEDGMENT PROTOCOL
===============================================================================

Before AD work begins, confirm:

```
□ I have read this entire handoff document
□ I have read OD-outbound-findings.md completely
□ I understand OD-F-005 / OD-F-MP-001 (Organization IS Density) applies to ALL AD work
□ I understand the TRANSITIVE CHAIN: org pattern → density pattern → axis preference
□ I have noted each OD exploration's natural axis preference (OD-F-FL-001)
□ I understand the quality bar (>=32 for INCLUDE, 100% soul compliance, 0 anti-patterns)
□ I will read R-4 Axis Innovations (192 findings) as primary research before building
□ I will evaluate R-2 Creative Layouts (25 applicable findings — see R-2 section)
□ I will read OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md and apply unified conventions from day one
□ I will create provenance INCREMENTALLY during build, not after
□ I will deploy gate-based team topology (recommended — see TOPOLOGY EVALUATION)
```

===============================================================================
## ORGANIZATIONAL PATTERNS (6 Total, All VALIDATED / INCLUDE)
===============================================================================

| Pattern | OD | Score (v3) | Density Pairing | Key Insight |
|---------|-----|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **CONVERSATIONAL** | OD-001 | 37/40 | PULSE + TIDAL | Q&A IS PULSE -- sparse questions, dense answers |
| **NARRATIVE** | OD-002 | 35/40 | CRESCENDO | Story arc IS CRESCENDO -- exposition sparse, climax dense |
| **TASK-BASED** | OD-003 | ~35/40 | ISLANDS + BOOKENDS | Task clusters ARE ISLANDS. Dual mode: static + interactive. |
| **CONFIDENCE** | OD-004 | 34/40 | GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO | Border-weight gradient (4px/3px/2px/1px) encodes confidence as flat 2D |
| **SPATIAL** | OD-005 | 35/40 | WAVE + ISLANDS | Hub-spoke IS WAVE. Dark header creates 3-phase density cascade. |
| **CREATIVE** | OD-006 | 37/40 | ALL (FRACTAL) | Organization IS Density. 5 fractal scales (crown jewel). |

**Average: ~35.5/40.** Range 34-37 (compressed from 33-36 pre-enrichment).

===============================================================================
## OD OUTBOUND FINDINGS (Mandatory Consumption)
===============================================================================

**Reference:** `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/OD-outbound-findings.md`

### AD MUST Consume

| Finding | What It Says | AD Responsibility |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **OD-F-005** | Organization IS Density. Confirmed at token level (zone naming). | Axis geometry serves a SINGLE org-density phenomenon |
| **OD-F-MP-001** | 5 org=density identities confirmed across all 6 ODs | ALL AD explorations treat org-density as unified |
| **OD-F-FL-001** | Org patterns imply axis preferences | AD must RESPECT natural axis preferences |
| **OD-F-001** | Width variation (Q 60%, A 100%) creates TIDAL rhythm | Preserve width relationships in axis layouts |
| **OD-F-003** | Q&A as natural PULSE generator | Must not flatten Q/A into uniform columns |
| **OD-F-004** | Chapter dividers as breathing zones | Axis layouts include spacing between dense sections |
| **OD-F-007** | Mode-transition breathing (48px+) | Accommodate mode transitions in multi-org layouts |
| **OD-F-AP-001** | 2px border epidemic (substantially remediated) | Enforce 3-category border system from day one |

### AD SHOULD Reference

OD-F-002 (fractal nesting), OD-F-006 (meta-doc test), OD-F-008 (compound creative),
OD-F-009 (narrative CRESCENDO), OD-F-010 (type=density), OD-F-011 (tension wayfinding),
OD-F-012 (code absence), OD-F-013 (decision climax), OD-F-PR-001 (bespoke research).

===============================================================================
## THE TRANSITIVE CHAIN (CRITICAL)
===============================================================================

```
Organizational Pattern (OD-F-005)
       ↓  [organization IS density]
Density Pattern (DD-F-001 through DD-F-005)
       ↓  [density implies axis — DD-F-012]
Axis Preference (OD-F-FL-001)
       ↓  [axis serves the unified phenomenon]
AD Geometry Decision
```

AD's job is NOT to pick axes in isolation. It is to validate that specific axis
geometries serve the unified org-density phenomenon.

===============================================================================
## SOUL PIECES + ANTI-PHYSICAL IDENTITY
===============================================================================

**5 Visual Soul Pieces (enforced):** Sharp Edges (border-radius: 0), Archivist
Serif, Family DNA (4px left + 2-zone), No Shadows (box-shadow: none), Squares
Signal. No cognitive soul piece discovered by OD. AD may find spatial ones.

**ANTI-PHYSICAL diagnostic:** 20/20 SOUL FAILs across re-enrichment reject
anything creating perceived depth/movement/3D: shadows, z-animation, rounded
shapes, gradients-as-light, traffic-light colors, parallax. Use as pre-filter.

**Soul compliance:** OD achieved 100% across 3,479+ elements and maintained it
through 43-agent re-enrichment. AD must match. Not optional.

===============================================================================
## QUALITY BAR
===============================================================================

| Metric | OD Achieved (v3) | AD Target |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Average score | ~35.5/40 (34-37) | >=32 for INCLUDE |
| Soul compliance | 100% | 100% required |
| R-1 application rate | 78.6% (22/28) | >=80% for R-4 |
| EXT-* application rate | 95.8% (91/95) | >=90% for bespoke |
| DD-F-006 fractal | 100% (5 scales in crown jewel) | 100% all ADs |
| Convention compliance | All 6 ODs unified | Apply BEFORE building |

===============================================================================
## PRIMARY RESEARCH FOR AD
===============================================================================

| Research | Priority | Findings | Location |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| R-4 Axis Innovations | PRIMARY | 192 | `original-research/R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS.md` |
| R-2 Creative Layouts | EVALUATED | 25 applicable, 2 SOUL FAIL | `original-research/R2-CREATIVE-LAYOUTS.md` |
| R-5 Combination Theory | Reference | 39 | `original-research/R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md` |

### R-2 Evaluation (No Longer at 0%)

OD re-enrichment evaluated all 27 R-2 findings. 25 SOUL PASS, 2 SOUL FAIL
(R2-6.2 overlapping, R2-6.4 card animation). 6 universal findings apply to all
ODs. Full evaluation: `_od-reenrichment/r2-evaluation.md`. AD-priority R-2
findings: R2-2.1 (F/Z-Pattern), R2-4.1 (Bento Grid), R2-4.3 (CSS Grid fr),
R2-4.5 (Swiss Grid), R2-6.1 (Split Screen).

**Bespoke > pre-existing:** EXT-* at 95.8% vs R-1 at 78.6%. Commission bespoke
axis-geometry research per AD exploration.

===============================================================================
## OD ITERATION LESSONS
===============================================================================

### Highest-Scoring ODs: OD-001 and OD-006 (37/40)

Both scored highest because: full creative enrichment across 3 iterations
(v1→v2→v3), bespoke research applied at >=95%, strongest identity conviction.
OD-006 additionally: crown jewel synthesis page, 5 fractal scales, zone token
bookend validation with OD-001.
**AD Lesson:** Commission bespoke research and plan for at least 2 iterations.

### Lowest-Scoring OD: OD-004 Confidence (34/40)

Scored lowest because: hardest soul test (geological metaphor implies physical
depth), most 2px borders requiring remediation (6 eliminated in Wave 3).
**AD Lesson:** Metaphors implying physicality require extra soul testing. The
solution is flat 2D encoding (border-weight gradient), not depth cues.

### Dialect Gap: RESOLVED Through Convention Unification

Three quality dialects emerged during original build:
- **Dialect A: Polished** (OD-001/002) -- dark code blocks, full-bleed headers
- **Dialect B: Functional** (OD-003/004/005) -- lighter code blocks, thin borders
- **Dialect C: Editorial** (OD-006) -- no code blocks, heaviest typography

**RESOLVED** through OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (468 lines) applied to all 6 ODs.
All ODs now share: dark code blocks, dark header, zone tokens, type scale,
border system. Intentional variation (OD-006's 3rem title) preserved.
AD MUST apply conventions from day one to prevent dialect drift.

### Iteration Guidance

DD re-audit: +1.8 avg. OD re-enrichment: +1.7 avg. Iteration IS quality.
- Build draft → audit → enrich → rebuild. First-draft ~32-33; target 35+ after.
- Use meta-doc content (OD-F-006) as calibration. Plan AD-006 as crown jewel.

### Key Re-Enrichment Discoveries for AD

- **ISLANDS dual mode:** Static (spatial) + interactive (collapse/expand via
  `<details>`). First OD where READER controls density distribution.
- **Border-weight gradient:** 4px/3px/2px/1px encodes confidence as FLAT 2D
  signal. Answers "can geological metaphor avoid physical depth?" with YES.
- **5th fractal scale:** Navigation emerges from combining enrichment techniques
  in OD-006. Emerges from compound patterns, not design intent.
- **Dark header universality:** Validated across all 3 waves (conversational,
  task-based, spatial, confidence, editorial). Creates stronger LANDMARK
  regardless of organizational pattern.
- **Semi-transparent backgrounds systemic:** rgba < 1.0 found in every wave.
  Binary rule: opacity === 1 on all visual elements.

===============================================================================
## MISTAKES TO AVOID (10 Items)
===============================================================================

1. **Missing the Transitive Chain** -- org→density→axis is one phenomenon.
2. **Building Before Conventions** -- OD's 3 dialects required 43-agent remediation. Apply OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md + AD-specific conventions BEFORE AD-001.
3. **Skipping R-2** -- 25 applicable findings evaluated. Use `r2-evaluation.md`.
4. **Not Commissioning Bespoke Research** -- EXT-* at 95.8% >> R-1 at 78.6%.
5. **Deferred Provenance** -- Write AD-F-### entries DURING build. OD's deferred approach caused the OD-F-005 collision requiring 18-agent remediation.
6. **2px Border Epidemic** -- Use 3-category system: Cat 1 structural (3px+), Cat 2 separator (1px), Cat 3 micro (1px). Zero 2px. Understand orthogonal axes.
7. **Soul Compliance as Optional** -- 100% non-negotiable. Verify DURING building. opacity === 1 on all offsets (binary gate).
8. **Semi-Transparent Backgrounds** -- Every wave found rgba < 1.0 not caught by prior audits. Audit `rgba(` and `opacity:` explicitly. Binary rule.
9. **No Verification Gates** -- Deploy gate-based topology from Wave 1 (see TOPOLOGY EVALUATION). OD's post-hoc audit was costlier than per-wave checks.
10. **No Crown Jewel Plan** -- Designate AD-006 from day one. Plan research budget and compound axis techniques accordingly.

===============================================================================
## RE-ENRICHMENT TOPOLOGY EVALUATION
===============================================================================

### Did Gate-Based Execution Produce Measurably Better Output? YES.

**Scores:** Average +1.7 (33.8→35.5). Floor raised 33→34. Crown jewel 36→37.

**Role Separation:** Zero violations. Researcher/Builder/Scribe/Verifier never
crossed boundaries. Eliminated OD-F-005 collision class entirely.

**Gates:** 60/60 substantive checks PASS. 1 false positive (Wave 2 Check 5:
browser cache, overridden). 98.6% clean first-pass rate.

**vs Original Build:**

| Dimension | Original | Gate-Based |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Conventions | 3 dialects | Unified from Wave 0 |
| Provenance | Deferred → 18-agent remediation | Scribe per wave, 0 collisions |
| Borders | 108 CSS declarations (2px) | 3-category, 11+ eliminated |
| R-2 | 0% consumed | 27/27 evaluated |
| Verification | Post-hoc 17-agent audit | Per-wave binary gates |

**AD Recommendation:** Deploy gate-based topology. Keep role separation, binary
gates, convention-before-building. Modify: front-load R-4 evaluation in Wave 0,
pair 2 ADs per wave, add rgba sweep as mandatory gate check.

===============================================================================
## OD-TO-AXIS PAIRING (MANDATORY)
===============================================================================

| OD Pattern | Density | AD Exploration | Rationale |
|------------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| CONVERSATIONAL | PULSE + TIDAL | AD-001 Z-Pattern | Z-pattern pairs with Q&A width alternation |
| NARRATIVE | CRESCENDO | AD-002 F-Pattern | F-pattern follows progressive narrative |
| TASK-BASED | ISLANDS + BOOKENDS | AD-003 Bento Grid | Bento grid = discrete task containers |
| CONFIDENCE | GEOLOGICAL | AD-004 Spiral Reveal | Spiral discloses confidence layers |
| SPATIAL | WAVE + ISLANDS | AD-005 Axis Choreography | Choreographed hub-spoke transitions |
| CREATIVE | FRACTAL primary | AD-006 Creative | Compound axis using all 5 prior patterns |

All ADs must apply DD-F-006 (FRACTAL) and respect OD-F-005 (org IS density).

===============================================================================
## DD FINDINGS CARRIED FORWARD
===============================================================================

DD-F-006 (fractal all scales), DD-F-007 (consistency > variety), DD-F-010
(org serves density — ELEVATED by OD-F-005), DD-F-012 (density implies axis —
CORE AD CONSTRAINT), DD-F-013 (component density tolerance), DD-F-015
(traffic-light anti-pattern), DD-F-016 (border consistency).

===============================================================================
## AD'S RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE CHAIN
===============================================================================

### Files AD Must Create

```
□ provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/STAGE-HEADER.md
  - "The Story", consumed/produced tables, key decisions

□ provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/AD-SYNTHESIS.md
  - Cross-AD patterns and insights

□ provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/AD-RESEARCH-GATE.md
  - R-4 APPLIED/NOT per finding + R-2 consumption decisions

□ provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/AD-outbound-findings.md
  - AD-F-### for CD and Migration

□ provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md
  - CD reads this FIRST at Phase 0

□ provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/CLAUDE.md
  - 5-section structure per governance standard
```

### Files AD Must Update

```
□ DESIGN-SYSTEM/patterns/axis-patterns.md (provenance headers per pattern)
□ DESIGN-SYSTEM/BACKBONE.md (Stage 4 → COMPLETE)
□ provenance/PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md (AD-F-###, R-4 status, R-2 decisions)
□ provenance/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md (AD application rates)
□ checkpoints/SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md (IF new spatial soul pieces)
□ explorations/axis/CLAUDE.md (AD scores)
□ explorations/CLAUDE.md (AD status ⏳ → ✅)
□ provenance/CLAUDE.md (Stage 4 status)
```

**Verify:**
```
□ 6 AD explorations created, scored >=32 for INCLUDE
□ 5 soul pieces verified, 0 violations, 0 semi-transparent backgrounds
□ DD-F-006 fractal + OD-F-005 org=density + transitive chain documented per AD
□ No 2px borders, no traffic-light violations
□ AD-F-### findings documented, handoff to CD created
□ R-4 >=80%, R-2 decisions documented, convention compliance verified
□ Mode-transition breathing (OD-F-007) where layouts mix org modes
```

===============================================================================
## MODE C PROVENANCE GUIDANCE
===============================================================================

Create provenance INCREMENTALLY during build. Discover → write AD-F-### IMMEDIATELY.
Apply research → update RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md IMMEDIATELY. OD's gate-based scribes
achieved 0 collisions across 42 new findings. If you can't cite provenance for a
decision, stop and write it down.

===============================================================================
## PROVENANCE-CHECKLIST-TEMPLATE
===============================================================================

```
Before marking ANY stage COMPLETE:
- [ ] outbound-findings EXISTS with >=10 findings
- [ ] HANDOFF EXISTS with acknowledgment protocol
- [ ] SYNTHESIS EXISTS with consumption/production tables
- [ ] STAGE-HEADER says COMPLETE in YAML + heading
- [ ] PIPELINE-MANIFEST updated with stage findings + lifecycle counts
- [ ] BACKBONE updated with past-tense stage entry
- [ ] PATTERN-INDEX updated with VALIDATED patterns
- [ ] SOUL-DISCOVERIES has stage determination
- [ ] FINDINGS-INDEX has stage entries
- [ ] Fresh agent can answer 5 J-03 questions from provenance alone
```

**J-03 Test:** A fresh agent with NO prior context answers 5 questions from
provenance alone: (1) What did this stage discover? (2) What constraints inherited?
(3) What constraints passed forward? (4) Research consumed at what rate? (5) Quality
bar achieved? If any unanswerable, chain is INCOMPLETE.

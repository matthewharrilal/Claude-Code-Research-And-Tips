# R5-COMBINATION-THEORY
## Component Combination Principles for KortAI Documentation

**Research Agent:** R-5
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Sources:** PERCEPTUAL-TRUTHS.md, CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE.md, batch-04-heavy-cross.html, COMPONENTS-REGISTRY.md

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the theoretical framework for how KortAI's 11 documentation components should combine. It addresses harmony (what goes together), tension (productive contrast), sequence (ordering), grouping (spatial relationships), nesting (containment), and meta-relationships (moods, voices, kinship).

The core insight: **Components are not interchangeable puzzle pieces.** Each has a character, a density signature, and a structural role. Combination is choreography, not collision.

**AD Validation Note:** AD-F-023 (ATTENTION TOPOLOGY) and AD-F-024 (compound = sequential) provide the spatial framework for applying these combination principles. AD proved that axis IS organization IS density (AD-F-004), meaning component combinations are constrained by their natural axis-density pairings. CD must evaluate all 39 R-5 findings through this lens.

---

## Part 1: Component Harmony

### Principle H1: Family Cohesion Through Shared DNA

Components within the same family combine seamlessly because they share structural DNA.

**Callout Family (Info, Tip, Gotcha, Essence, Challenge):**
- Same zone structure (label + body + left accent)
- Same spacing rhythm (24px top, 28px bottom asymmetric)
- Same typography pattern (uppercase label, sans-serif body)
- **Harmony mechanism:** Color differentiation creates semantic variety within structural unity

**Example — Natural Callout Sequence:**
```
[Info Callout] — "Before you begin..."
[Tip Callout] — "You can also try..."
[Gotcha Callout] — "Watch out for..."
```

This reads as a cohesive advisory unit, not three separate interruptions.

### Principle H2: Contrast Creates Perceived Harmony

Paradoxically, high-contrast pairings can feel harmonious when they fulfill complementary roles.

**High-Harmony Contrasting Pairs:**

| Pair | Contrast Type | Harmony Mechanism |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Code Snippet + Essence Callout | Dark/Light, Technical/Philosophical | Philosophy explains code's "why" |
| File Tree + Decision Matrix | Dense/Open, Vertical/Horizontal | Map → Options pattern |
| Task Component + Reasoning | Action/Deliberation | Tasks emerge from reasoning |

**Why this works:** The contrast is *functional*, not decorative. Each component answers a question the other raises.

### Principle H3: Shared Visual Anchors

Components harmonize when they share visual anchor points:

**Left-Anchored Components:**
- All Callouts (left border flag)
- File Tree (left border)
- Decision Matrix (left border)
- Code Snippet (no anchor, but dark mass creates left-edge gravity)

**Framed Components:**
- Core Abstraction (1px frame)
- Reasoning Component (1px frame)

**Recommendation:** When mixing anchored and framed components, place anchored components before framed components. The left-anchor creates reading momentum; the frame signals "pause and consider."

### Finding H4: The "Editorial Spread" Pattern

Components that feel like they belong on the same magazine spread:
- **File Tree + Core Abstraction** — Structure map + principle explanation
- **Decision Matrix + Reasoning** — Options + deliberation
- **Code Snippet + Tip Callout** — Example + practical advice
- **Essence Callout + Challenge Callout** — Wisdom + action prompt

These pairs have complementary *editorial roles* — one sets up, one pays off.

---

## Part 2: Component Tension

### Principle T1: Productive Tension vs. Jarring Collision

Tension is useful when it creates *cognitive pause* without *cognitive dissonance*.

**Productive Tension Examples:**

| Pair | Tension Source | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Gotcha Callout + Code Snippet | Warning before example | "Don't do this" → "This is wrong" |
| Essence Callout + Reasoning | Axiom + Deliberation | "The principle" → "But consider..." |
| Task Component + Gotcha | Action list + Hazard | "Do these things" → "But not this way" |

**Jarring Collision Examples:**

| Pair | Why It Fails | Effect |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Essence + Essence (consecutive) | Axiom fatigue | Dilutes importance of both |
| Gotcha + Gotcha (consecutive) | Alarm fatigue | Reader tunes out warnings |
| Code Snippet + Code Snippet (no separation) | No breathing room | Wall of code, no comprehension |
| Reasoning + Reasoning (consecutive) | Decision paralysis | Too many forks without resolution |

### Principle T2: The Velocity Mismatch Rule

Components have reading velocities:
- **Fast:** Callouts (quick scan), Tasks (checklist scan)
- **Medium:** Decision Matrix (columnar scan), File Tree (structured scan)
- **Slow:** Code Snippet (line-by-line), Reasoning (deliberate), Core Abstraction (contemplative)

**Rule:** Avoid placing two SLOW components consecutively without a FAST component between them.

**Bad:**
```
[Reasoning Component] — 2 columns of analysis
[Core Abstraction] — Philosophy + code
[Code Snippet] — 40 lines of example
```
This creates reader fatigue. Insert breathing room:

**Good:**
```
[Reasoning Component] — 2 columns of analysis
[Tip Callout] — "Given the above, start with Option A"
[Core Abstraction] — Philosophy + code
[Code Snippet] — 40 lines of example
```

### Principle T3: Semantic Dissonance

Components have semantic temperatures:
- **Warm:** Tip (friendly), Challenge (inviting), Essence (reverent)
- **Neutral:** Info, File Tree, Decision Matrix, Code Snippet
- **Cold:** Gotcha (warning), Task (utilitarian)

**Rule:** Don't oscillate rapidly between warm and cold.

**Dissonant:**
```
[Tip Callout] — "Here's a friendly tip!"
[Gotcha Callout] — "DANGER: This will break your system"
[Challenge Callout] — "Try this fun experiment!"
```

**Better:**
```
[Tip Callout] — "Here's a friendly tip!"
[Code Snippet] — Example of the tip
[Gotcha Callout] — "But avoid this common mistake"
```

The neutral Code Snippet acts as a *temperature buffer*.

### Finding T4: The 2-Callout Limit

**Never place more than 2 callouts consecutively.** After 2 callouts, readers experience "sidebar fatigue" -- the margin annotation loses its power to interrupt. **AD Confirmed:** DD-F-014 (max 2 callouts per viewport) was enforced across all 6 AD explorations. AD-005 (Choreography) had the highest callout density and specifically validated this limit.

If you need 3+ advisories:
1. Group them into a single Info Callout with bullets
2. Interleave with prose or code
3. Use a Decision Matrix to compare the considerations

---

## Part 3: Sequence Patterns

### Principle S1: The Setup-Payoff Arc

Every documentation section should have a narrative arc:

**Classic Pattern:**
1. **Context** — Info Callout or prose (where are we?)
2. **Map** — File Tree or Decision Matrix (what are the options?)
3. **Principle** — Essence Callout or Core Abstraction (why does this matter?)
4. **Demonstration** — Code Snippet (show me)
5. **Action** — Task Component or Challenge Callout (what do I do?)
6. **Hazards** — Gotcha Callout (what can go wrong?)

**Not every section needs all 6**, but they should appear in this order when present.

### Principle S2: Density Wave Sequencing

**AD Validation (AD-F-024, AD-F-025):** AD proved that compound pages are SEQUENTIAL (one axis pattern per section, compound through scroll), not simultaneous. The transition grammar (AD-F-025) classifies all 20 directed transitions as Smooth/Bridge/Breathing. CD must apply density wave sequencing WITHIN each axis section and manage TRANSITIONS between axis sections using the 5x5 grammar matrix.

Page density should follow a wave pattern, not a plateau:

```
LOW  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
     │ Intro │ Example │ Reflection │ Next │
MED  ████░░░░░░░░░████████░░░░░░░░░░██████
HIGH ░░░░░░████████░░░░░░░░░████████░░░░░░
```

**Translation:**
1. Start LOW (orientation, callout)
2. Build to HIGH (code block, file tree)
3. Release to LOW-MED (callout, prose)
4. Build again if section continues

**Anti-pattern:** Starting with Code Snippet (reader has no context) or ending with Code Snippet (no resolution).

### Principle S3: The First Component Rule

The first component on a page or section sets the *tone*:

| First Component | Sets Tone Of |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Info Callout | Helpful guide |
| Code Snippet | Technical reference |
| Essence Callout | Philosophical treatise |
| Task Component | Practical tutorial |
| Decision Matrix | Decision-making guide |
| Gotcha Callout | Troubleshooting guide |

**Choose deliberately.** A section starting with Code Snippet says "we assume you know what this is." A section starting with Info Callout says "let me orient you first."

### Principle S4: The Resolution Component

Sections should end with *resolution*, not *tension*:

| Good Endings | Bad Endings |
|--------------|-------------|
| Task Component (clear next steps) | Gotcha Callout (anxiety without action) |
| Challenge Callout (invitation to practice) | Reasoning Component (open question) |
| Tip Callout (parting wisdom) | Code Snippet (no interpretation) |
| Prose summary | Decision Matrix (options but no guidance) |

**Exception:** Reasoning Component is acceptable as an ending when the recommendation zone provides clear guidance.

### Finding S5: The "Teaching Moment" Sequence

When explaining a concept, use this proven sequence:

```
[Essence Callout] — "The core principle"
[Core Abstraction] — Principle + minimal code proof
[Code Snippet] — Full implementation example
[Tip Callout] — Practical advice for applying it
```

This moves from abstract → concrete → practical, matching how developers process new concepts.

---

## Part 4: Grouping Principles

### Principle G1: Semantic Proximity

Related components should be visually proximate:

**Tight Grouping (8-16px gap):**
- Code Snippet + its explanatory Tip Callout
- Decision Matrix + Reasoning Component analyzing the options
- File Tree + Core Abstraction explaining the structure

**Standard Grouping (24-32px gap):**
- Between different topics within a section
- Between prose and component

**Section Break (48-64px gap):**
- Between major conceptual sections
- Before/after a "teaching moment" sequence

### Principle G2: The Container Signal

**Framed components (Core Abstraction, Reasoning) signal completeness.** They say: "This is a bounded thought."

**Anchored components (Callouts, Decision Matrix) signal annotation.** They say: "This relates to what's around it."

**Grouping implication:** Don't place two framed components adjacent without a non-framed component between them. Two bounded thoughts need connective tissue.

```
[Core Abstraction] — Bounded teaching moment
[Tip Callout] — "In practice, this means..." ← Connection
[Reasoning Component] — Bounded deliberation
```

### Principle G3: Visual Weight Balance

Components have visual weight:

| Weight | Components |
|--------|------------|
| Heavy | Code Snippet (dark mass), Reasoning (large frame), Core Abstraction (frame + dark code) |
| Medium | Decision Matrix, Task Component, File Tree |
| Light | All Callouts (left anchor only, no full container) |

**Rule:** Balance heavy components with light ones. A page of all-heavy components feels oppressive. A page of all-light components feels insubstantial.

**Golden Ratio:** For every heavy component, include 1-2 light components before the next heavy component.

### Finding G4: The "Advisory Cluster"

When multiple advisories relate to the same concept, group them:

**Instead of scattered:**
```
[Prose about X]
[Gotcha about X]
[Prose about Y]
[Tip about X]
[Code for X]
```

**Use an advisory cluster:**
```
[Prose about X]
[Info Callout] — Context for X
[Tip Callout] — Advice for X
[Gotcha Callout] — Warning about X
[Code for X]
```

The cluster reads as a single "advisory moment" rather than scattered interruptions.

---

## Part 5: Nesting vs. Stacking

### Principle N1: Components Generally Stack, Not Nest

KortAI components are designed to **stack vertically**, not nest within each other. The flat, editorial design philosophy rejects deep nesting. **AD Reinforced (AD-F-024):** Compound axis is sequential through scrolling time, not simultaneous within viewport. This extends the stacking principle to the axis level: even axis patterns stack vertically, they do not nest or overlap.

**Stack (Correct):**
```
[Core Abstraction]
  └── Contains embedded Code Snippet (allowed, this is intentional composite design)

[Reasoning Component]
  └── Amber summary zone at bottom (built-in, not nested component)
```

**Nest (Incorrect):**
```
[Info Callout containing [Code Snippet]]  ← NO
[Task Component containing [Tip Callout]] ← NO
```

### Principle N2: Composite Components Are Pre-Composed

Two components are explicitly composites:
- **Core Abstraction** = Essence-style quote + Code Snippet
- **Reasoning Component** = Question + Two-column comparison + Summary

These are *intentionally designed* composites. Don't create ad-hoc composites by nesting.

### Principle N3: When Nesting Feels Necessary, Re-sequence

If you feel the urge to nest components, it usually means they should be sequential:

**Urge:** "I want a Tip Callout inside this Code Snippet to explain line 5."

**Solution:** Place the Tip Callout before or after the Code Snippet, reference the line number:
```
[Tip Callout] — "In line 5 below, notice how we..."
[Code Snippet]
```

**Urge:** "I want a Gotcha inside this Task Component item."

**Solution:** Add the Gotcha after the task list:
```
[Task Component]
[Gotcha Callout] — "When completing task 3, avoid..."
```

### Finding N4: The Depth Limit

Maximum effective depth is **1 level**:
- Component → Embedded zone (e.g., Core Abstraction → Code zone)
- Page → Components
- Section → Components

Beyond this, complexity exceeds editorial restraint.

---

## Part 6: Component Relationships

### Framework R1: Kinship Model

Components have relationships analogous to family structures:

**Siblings (Same Family DNA):**
- Info, Tip, Gotcha, Essence, Challenge (Callout siblings)
- Code Snippet, File Tree (Technical siblings)
- Decision Matrix, Reasoning Component (Analytical siblings)

**Parent-Child (Composite Containment):**
- Core Abstraction is parent to Essence-style quote (child) and Code Snippet (child)
- Reasoning Component is parent to Question zone, Columns, and Summary zone

**Cousins (Shared Traits, Different Families):**
- Essence Callout & Core Abstraction — both use serif italic, reverent tone
- Task Component & Decision Matrix — both create structured lists/grids
- File Tree & Code Snippet — both use monospace typography

### Framework R2: Component Moods

Components have emotional valences:

| Component | Primary Mood | Secondary Mood |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Info Callout | Helpful | Neutral |
| Tip Callout | Friendly | Encouraging |
| Gotcha Callout | Urgent | Protective |
| Essence Callout | Reverent | Contemplative |
| Challenge Callout | Inviting | Playful |
| Code Snippet | Authoritative | Technical |
| File Tree | Methodical | Comprehensive |
| Decision Matrix | Impartial | Systematic |
| Core Abstraction | Wise | Teaching |
| Task Component | Productive | Focused |
| Reasoning Component | Deliberate | Balanced |

**Mood Combinations:**
- **Contemplative + Teaching:** Essence → Core Abstraction (builds depth)
- **Urgent + Productive:** Gotcha → Task (protect then act)
- **Inviting + Technical:** Challenge → Code Snippet (explore by doing)

### Framework R3: Component Voices

If components spoke, they would have distinct voices:

| Component | Voice Register | Speaking Style |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Info Callout | Professional concierge | "Allow me to mention..." |
| Tip Callout | Experienced colleague | "Between us, I've found..." |
| Gotcha Callout | Vigilant advisor | "Stop. This matters." |
| Essence Callout | Wise archivist | "If you remember nothing else..." |
| Challenge Callout | Enthusiastic mentor | "Try this, it's interesting..." |
| Code Snippet | Silent transcriptionist | *Says nothing, shows everything* |
| File Tree | Methodical librarian | "Everything has its place." |
| Decision Matrix | Impartial cartographer | "Here are your options." |
| Core Abstraction | Sagacious teacher | "The principle. Now watch." |
| Task Component | Efficient assistant | "Here's what to do." |
| Reasoning Component | Thoughtful counselor | "Consider both sides. My guidance: ..." |

**Voice Harmony Rule:** Don't follow an enthusiastic voice with an authoritative voice immediately. Provide transition.

```
[Challenge Callout] — "Try this fun experiment!"
[Prose transition] — "When you do, you'll notice..."
[Code Snippet] — The example
```

## Part 7: Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A1: Callout Cacophony

**Pattern:**
```
[Info Callout]
[Tip Callout]
[Gotcha Callout]
[Challenge Callout]
```

**Why it fails:** The margin annotation loses its interruption power. Reader experiences "sidebar blindness."

**Fix:** Limit to 2 consecutive callouts. Interleave with prose or code.

### Anti-Pattern A2: Code Wall

**Pattern:**
```
[Code Snippet — 50 lines]
[Code Snippet — 30 lines]
[Code Snippet — 45 lines]
```

**Why it fails:** No interpretation, no breathing room, no comprehension scaffolding.

**Fix:** Interleave with explanatory callouts or prose. Maximum 40-50 lines per snippet before commentary.

### Anti-Pattern A3: Decision Paralysis

**Pattern:**
```
[Decision Matrix — 5 options]
[Reasoning Component — "Option A vs B"]
[Reasoning Component — "Option B vs C"]
[Reasoning Component — "Option C vs D"]
```

**Why it fails:** Too many decision forks without resolution. Reader can't synthesize.

**Fix:** One Decision Matrix → One Reasoning Component with clear recommendation. If more options need analysis, create separate sections.

### Anti-Pattern A4: Orphaned Heavy Components

**Pattern:**
```
[Prose paragraph]
[Core Abstraction]
[Next section header]
```

**Why it fails:** Heavy component (Core Abstraction) needs decompression. Jumping to next section feels abrupt.

**Fix:** Add a Tip Callout or prose summary after heavy components:
```
[Prose paragraph]
[Core Abstraction]
[Tip Callout] — "In practice, this principle means..."
[Next section header]
```

### Anti-Pattern A5: Temperature Whiplash

**Pattern:**
```
[Essence Callout] — Reverent wisdom
[Gotcha Callout] — DANGER! WARNING!
[Challenge Callout] — Have fun trying this!
```

**Why it fails:** Emotional register oscillates too rapidly. Reader experiences tonal dissonance.

**Fix:** Use neutral components (Code Snippet, prose) as temperature buffers between warm and cold components.

### Anti-Pattern A6: Missing Context Start

**Pattern:**
```
# Section: Authentication
[Code Snippet — JWT implementation]
```

**Why it fails:** No orientation. Reader doesn't know what they're looking at or why.

**Fix:**
```
# Section: Authentication
[Info Callout] — "This section covers JWT token generation..."
[Code Snippet — JWT implementation]
```

### Anti-Pattern A7: Anxiety Ending

**Pattern:**
```
[Code Snippet — Implementation]
[Gotcha Callout] — "This will fail if X happens"
[End of section]
```

**Why it fails:** Section ends on anxiety without resolution. Reader left worried.

**Fix:**
```
[Code Snippet — Implementation]
[Gotcha Callout] — "This will fail if X happens"
[Tip Callout] — "To prevent this, always verify..."
[End of section]
```

| Page Length | Max Heavy Components | Max Callouts | Max Code Snippets |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Short (< 500 words) | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| Medium (500-1500 words) | 2-3 | 5-6 | 4-5 |
| Long (> 1500 words) | 4-5 | 8-10 | 6-8 |

### Guideline Q2: Spacing Standards

## Part 10: Summary of Findings

### The 20 Core Findings

1. **Family DNA creates natural harmony** — Callouts combine seamlessly because they share structural DNA
2. **Functional contrast is harmonious** — Philosophy explaining code feels unified, not dissonant
3. **Left-anchored components create reading momentum** — Place before framed components
4. **Framed components signal pause** — Use them for "bounded thoughts" requiring contemplation
5. **Two-callout limit prevents sidebar fatigue** — Never more than 2 consecutive callouts
6. **Velocity mismatch causes fatigue** — Insert FAST components between consecutive SLOW components
7. **Temperature buffers prevent whiplash** — Neutral components between warm and cold
8. **Setup-payoff arc structures sections** — Context → Map → Principle → Demo → Action → Hazards
9. **Density should wave, not plateau** — Alternate high and low density
10. **First component sets section tone** — Choose deliberately based on intent
11. **Sections need resolution endings** — Don't end on anxiety (Gotcha) or ambiguity (Decision Matrix)
12. **Teaching moment sequence is proven** — Essence → Core Abstraction → Code → Tip
13. **Semantic proximity requires tight spacing** — Related components should be visually close
14. **Heavy components need breathing room** — Follow with light components
15. **Advisory clusters reduce scatter** — Group related callouts together
16. **Components stack, don't nest** — Flat editorial design, maximum depth of 1
17. **Composite components are pre-designed** — Don't create ad-hoc nesting
18. **Components have moods** — Combine compatible moods, buffer incompatible ones
19. **Components have voices** — Don't follow enthusiastic with authoritative without transition
20. **Anti-patterns are specific and avoidable** — Callout cacophony, code wall, decision paralysis, orphaned heavy components, temperature whiplash, missing context, anxiety endings

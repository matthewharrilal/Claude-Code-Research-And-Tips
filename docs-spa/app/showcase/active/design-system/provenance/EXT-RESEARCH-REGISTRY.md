## Category 6: EXT-CREATIVE (Creative Techniques Research) — 9 Findings

Primary source: OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md (12 resources surveyed, 9 techniques extracted across 3 tiers). Applied in OD-001 (Tier 1 subset: 001-005) and OD-006 (all 9). Some inherited by OD-003-005 via shared patterns (solid offset, typographic cascade). Defined in OD-006 header (Block 1, lines 41-51) and identity-brief.md (lines 441-449).

### Tier 1 (Structural Techniques)

| ID | Name | Description | Source URL | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-CREATIVE-001 | THE SOLID OFFSET | Neobrutalist depth via pseudo-elements. `::after` pseudo-element creates solid color block behind components, replacing box-shadow with flat graphic technique. | Resource 4: Neobrutalism design principles | OD-001, OD-003 (inherited), OD-004 (inherited), OD-005 (inherited), OD-006 | APPLIED | **NEEDS REFINEMENT** — Opaque solid offsets: BORDERLINE (flat graphic vs floating illusion). Semi-transparent offsets (OD-001 essence/code): SPIRIT FAILS (colored glow = equivalent to box-shadow). |
| EXT-CREATIVE-002 | THE TYPOGRAPHIC HIERARCHY CASCADE | 5-level 1.5x ratio type system. Consistent mathematical relationship between heading levels. | Resources 1-2: Stripe/Linear typography | OD-001, OD-004 (inherited), OD-006 | APPLIED | **NEEDS REFINEMENT** — 3 values (section:26px, question:22px, meta:10px) deviate from locked type scale. Research ratio applied as raw directive. Fix: map to nearest locked values. |
| EXT-CREATIVE-003 | THE SCROLL WITNESS | CSS-only section progress tracking. Fixed sidebar with 3px-wide rectangular markers that fill as sections are scrolled. Uses `view()` timeline and `@property`. | Resource 3: CSS scroll-driven animations (MDN, Frontend Masters) | OD-001, OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Minimally styled, square markers, no decoration. Applied as REFINED. |
| EXT-CREATIVE-004 | THE ARRIVING WISDOM | Scroll-triggered staggered reveal. `opacity: 0->1`, `translateY(16px)->0`, 0.5s ease-out. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Chromium-only with static fallback. | Resource 3: CSS scroll-driven animations | OD-001, OD-004 (inherited), OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Subtle, accessible, progressive enhancement. Applied as REFINED. |

### Tier 2 (Enhancement Techniques)

| ID | Name | Description | Source URL | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-CREATIVE-005 | THE EDITORIAL DROP | Serif drop caps at section openings. `::first-letter` in Instrument Serif, 3.5em, primary color, float left. Classic editorial authority technique. | Resource 6: CSS magazine layouts | OD-001, OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Soul-aligned (Instrument Serif + primary color = editorial authority) |
| EXT-CREATIVE-006 | THE SEMANTIC BRIDGE | Hover over concept term highlights related code. `background: rgba(232,48,37,0.05)` on `.highlight-target`. Pedagogical interaction linking concept to implementation. | Resource 1: Stripe API docs (hover-to-illuminate) | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Educational interaction, minimal visual impact, uses locked color |
| EXT-CREATIVE-007 | THE DUAL LENS | Why/How toggle between serif (explanation) and monospace (implementation). Reinforces font-zone rules: serif=wisdom, mono=code. All elements `border-radius: 0` explicit. | Resource 7: Design system documentation sites | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Reinforces Soul Piece 2 (serif=wisdom, mono=code) |

### Tier 3 (Architectural Techniques)

| ID | Name | Description | Source URL | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-CREATIVE-008 | THE COLLAPSING HEADER | Sticky headers that shrink on scroll. Section headers reduce from full to compact on scroll, creating information density variation. `border-radius: 0` explicit. | Resource 10: Apple HIG documentation | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Functional interaction, no soul violations |
| EXT-CREATIVE-009 | THE VISUAL INDEX | Specimen-sheet grid overview. Grid layout for pattern/component overview. Square tiles, monospace labels. `border-radius: 0` explicit. | Resource 10: Apple HIG + Resource 7: design system sites | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Editorial technique, soul-aligned |

### v3 Re-Enrichment Additions (EXT-CREATIVE-010 through EXT-CREATIVE-015)

Added during OD-006 v3 re-enrichment. Sourced from research-package-od-006.md (researcher-3b). Builder-3b applied all 6 findings. Resolves Wave 2 forward question: "Can FRACTAL be made VISIBLE?"

| ID | Name | Description | Source URL | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-CREATIVE-010 | The Fractal Annotation Layer | Persistent CSS Grid sidebar annotations labeling current fractal scale (PAGE/SECTION/COMPONENT/CHARACTER). Makes 4-scale structure visible in real time as reader scrolls. Editorial marginalia tradition. | Wikiversity self-referential loops + Fractal.build | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Uses --font-mono, --type-meta 12px, --color-text-secondary. PRODUCTIVE TENSION: shows, doesn't explain. ELEVATES FRACTAL. |
| EXT-CREATIVE-011 | The Culmination Spread | Magazine culmination treatment: amplified page title (max type scale), retrospective visual integration (miniatures from prior ODs), per-section grid variation matching each OD pattern's natural layout. | Fiveable editorial design + yesimadesigner.com | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Amplified typography uses TOP of locked scale, not off-scale. STRONGLY SUPPORTS FRACTAL via per-section grid variation. |
| EXT-CREATIVE-012 | The Recursive Table of Contents | 3-level fractal TOC: section titles in --font-display (22px), subsections in --font-body (16px), density-mode annotations in --font-mono (12px). Serif/sans/mono cascade mirrors document's font-zone separation. | Fractal.build + CSS typographic scale basics | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Strengthens Soul Piece 2 (font-zone semantics at navigation level). ELEVATES FRACTAL — adds 5th scale (NAVIGATION). |
| EXT-CREATIVE-013 | The Pattern Echo | CSS-only miniature visual signatures of each OD's distinctive element in the visual index grid. OD-006 cell contains recursive miniature of its own grid (Hofstadterian strange loop). | DesignRush + UXPin + Component Gallery | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Flat CSS graphics, border-radius: 0, no box-shadow. STRONGLY SUPPORTS FRACTAL via recursive self-reference. |
| EXT-CREATIVE-014 | The Territorial Border-Color Hover | Replace territory-tile transform: translate(-2px,-2px) with border-color: var(--color-primary) + background-color shift. Flat 2D surface operation resolving MEDIUM spirit violation #4. | Cross-pollination from EXT-SPAT-013 + neobrutalism.dev | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Border-color is 2D surface change, no depth illusion. RESOLVES spirit violation. |
| EXT-CREATIVE-015 | The Scale Echo Typography | Consistent type scale ratio annotations in fractal annotation layer. Documents ratio consistency/variation across 4 fractal scales. Forward-looking finding for AD stage. | 30secondsofcode.org + EXT-CREATIVE-002 | OD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Uses locked type scale values (does NOT change them). PRODUCTIVE TENSION: exposing ratio imperfection is editorial integrity. |

## Category 7: EXT-AXIS-Z (Z-Pattern Research) — 5 Findings

All sourced from research-package-ad-001.md. Applied in AD-001 (Z-Pattern + Conversational + PULSE/TIDAL).

| ID | Name | Description | Source | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-AXIS-Z-001 | Z-Pattern Diagonal as Implicit Grid Line | Golden ratio (~38.2-degree angle) creates harmonic proportions between 4 Z-quadrants. `grid-template-rows: 1.618fr 1fr`. Diagonal is implied by content placement weight, not rendered as visible line. | Josef Muller-Brockmann grid systems + golden angle geometry | AD-001 | APPLIED | PASSED — Pure 2D geometric principle, no CSS depth/shadows/rounded corners |
| EXT-AXIS-Z-002 | Z-Pattern Velocity Control via Typography Weight | Eye movement speed along Z-pattern controlled by typographic weight: bold/heavy type at Z-entry points slows eye (PULSE pauses), light body text at Z-traverse allows faster scanning. Maps to PULSE: heavy=dense(slow), light=sparse(fast). | Typography + reading physics research | AD-001 | APPLIED | PASSED — Typography-based hierarchy (IS-2), uses locked fonts |
| EXT-AXIS-Z-003 | Z-Pattern Breakpoint Collapse Strategy | Z-pattern collapses to linear stack below 768px. PULSE preserved (Q/A alternation is vertical regardless). TIDAL transfers from width variation to background-color differentiation via zone tokens. | Responsive design principles | AD-001 | APPLIED | PASSED — Responsive design, soul-neutral. Zone tokens maintain density signals |
| EXT-AXIS-Z-004 | Z-Pattern as Conversational Turn-Taking | Each Z-cycle maps to one conversational turn (Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson 1974). Question = current speaker (left, narrow), answer = respondent (full-width). Z-diagonal = transition relevance place. | Conversational analysis (CA) turn-taking research | AD-001 | APPLIED | PASSED — Content-level structural pattern, soul-neutral |
| EXT-AXIS-Z-005 | Z-Pattern Micro-Z at Component Scale (Fractal Echo) | Within answer sections, code + explanation pairs create micro-Z: code top-left (primary optical), explanation top-right. Satisfies DD-F-006 fractal at component scale. `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr`. | DD-F-006 fractal self-similarity requirement | AD-001 | APPLIED | PASSED — Fractal structural principle, uses existing grid layout (IS-3) |

**AD-F findings sourced from EXT-AXIS-Z:** AD-F-001 (Z-001), AD-F-002 (Z-002, Z-004), AD-F-003 (Z-005), AD-F-004 (all 5)

## Category 8: EXT-AXIS-F (F-Pattern Research) — 5 Findings

All sourced from research-package-ad-002.md. Applied in AD-002 (F-Pattern + Narrative Arc + CRESCENDO).

| ID | Name | Description | Source | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-AXIS-F-001 | F-Pattern as Freytag Scanner | F-pattern's three horizontal scans map to Freytag's first three acts. First scan (full-width) = exposition. Second scan (shorter) = rising action. Vertical descent = climax through denouement. F-degradation IS CRESCENDO compression. | F-pattern reading physics + Freytag dramatic structure | AD-002 | APPLIED | PASSED — Reading physics observation, pure 2D scanning path |
| EXT-AXIS-F-002 | Editorial Spread Pacing for F-Pattern Sections | Each Freytag act is a "spread" with sparse-intro -> dense-body -> sparse-bridge internal structure. Creates EXT-NARR-011 micro/macro pacing within F-pattern axis. | Magazine editorial design (spread-level pacing) | AD-002 | APPLIED | PASSED — Editorial design principle, implements IS-7 |
| EXT-AXIS-F-003 | Left-Spine Landmark Hierarchy | F-pattern vertical descent relies on multi-signal landmark differentiation: H2 (Instrument Serif + 4px red left border), H3 (Inter italic), H4 (Inter uppercase + letter-spacing 0.05em). Redundant signals ensure scanning at speed catches landmarks. | Typography hierarchy research + NNG F-pattern scanning | AD-002 | APPLIED | PASSED — Typography hierarchy (IS-2), SIZE/COLOR/POSITION (IS-1) |
| EXT-AXIS-F-004 | CRESCENDO Exhale via Freytag Falling Action | F-pattern REVERSES after climax — reader reads more horizontally in Act IV as density decreases. Creates CRESCENDO with exhale. Act V matches Act I density (bookend). | Freytag dramatic structure + reading behavior research | AD-002 | APPLIED | PASSED — Structural pattern, no CSS soul implications |
| EXT-AXIS-F-005 | F-Pattern Code Block Placement Strategy | Code blocks follow attention degradation: Act I = zero code, Act II = short inline, Act III = full blocks with annotations, Act IV = comparison code, Act V = reference summary. Code density itself follows CRESCENDO. | Content strategy + progressive disclosure research | AD-002 | APPLIED | PASSED — Content strategy, code blocks use locked styles |

**AD-F findings sourced from EXT-AXIS-F:** AD-F-005 (F-001), AD-F-006 (F-002, F-003), AD-F-007 (F-003), AD-F-008 (F-005)

## Category 9: EXT-AXIS-B (Bento Grid Research) — 5 Findings

All sourced from research-package-ad-003.md. Applied in AD-003 (Bento Grid + Task-Based + ISLANDS/BOOKENDS).

| ID | Name | Description | Source | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-AXIS-B-001 | Bento Grid as ISLANDS Spatial Encoding | Grid cells directly encode ISLANDS: large cells (2x2) = large islands (high density), small cells (1x1) = small islands (low density), grid gaps = ocean (zero density). Bento IS the ISLANDS pattern rendered as CSS Grid. | CSS Grid layout + ISLANDS density pattern | AD-003 | APPLIED | PASSED — Pure CSS Grid, border-radius: 0, hierarchy through SIZE (IS-1) |
| EXT-AXIS-B-002 | Progressive Complexity via Grid Position | Grid position encodes complexity: simpler tasks (Beginner) in top-left (primary optical per Gutenberg), complex tasks (Advanced) in bottom-right (terminal). Creates CRESCENDO within ISLANDS. | Gutenberg diagram + EXT-TASK-014 progressive complexity | AD-003 | APPLIED | PASSED — Positional hierarchy (IS-1), no decoration needed |
| EXT-AXIS-B-003 | Collapsible Bento — ISLANDS Dual Mode in Grid Form | `<details>`/`<summary>` wrapping each grid cell. Collapsed = task headers as visual TOC (hub). Expanded = full task content (spoke). Combines hub-spoke navigation (R4-064) with ISLANDS dual mode. | OD-003 v3 ISLANDS dual mode + semantic HTML | AD-003 | APPLIED | PASSED — Semantic HTML, binary transition (no animation/gradients) |
| EXT-AXIS-B-004 | Bento Grid Internal Layout Variation (Anti-Monotony) | Each cell uses a DIFFERENT internal layout template (A: vertical steps, B: code-split 50/50, C: annotated diagram, D: comparison table). 3-4 templates rotating creates FRACTAL variation at component scale. Addresses OD-003 structural monotony deficit. | Magazine editorial design + EXT-TASK-013 | AD-003 | APPLIED | PASSED — Layout variation is STRUCTURAL not decorative, soul-aligned |
| EXT-AXIS-B-005 | Grid Gap as Density Signal | Varying grid gaps between sections creates meta-ISLANDS: dense section groups (16px gap within related tasks) separated by sparse section gaps (48px+ between categories). Implements EXT-TASK-015's 4-level spacing hierarchy at grid level. | ISLANDS density pattern + Gestalt grouping | AD-003 | APPLIED | PASSED — CSS gap property, whitespace as design (Rule 6) |

**AD-F findings sourced from EXT-AXIS-B:** AD-F-009 (B-001), AD-F-010 (B-001, B-002), AD-F-011 (B-004), AD-F-012 (B-005)

## Category 10: EXT-AXIS-SP (Spiral Layout Research) — 5 Findings

All sourced from research-package-ad-004.md. Applied in AD-004 (Spiral + Confidence-Based + GEOLOGICAL/CRESCENDO).

| ID | Name | Description | Source | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-AXIS-SP-001 | Golden Ratio as Geological Proportion System | Golden ratio (1.618) provides harmonious spiral ring widths: core (flex: 1) = densest/smallest, Probable (flex: 1.618), Speculative (flex: 2.618). Inner rings denser, outer rings sparser — mirrors geological strata accumulation. Not decorative mathematics: creates PERCEPTUAL signal. | Golden ratio proportions + geological stratification metaphor | AD-004 | APPLIED | PASSED — Pure CSS proportion via flex, hierarchy through SIZE (IS-1) |
| EXT-AXIS-SP-002 | Border-Weight Gradient as Flat Geological Encoding | Border-weight gradient (4px/3px/1px) encodes GEOLOGICAL strata as flat 2D signals. 4px = bedrock (heaviest, most certain), 3px = subsoil (subordinate), 1px = atmosphere (lightest, most speculative). Solves "depth without ANTI-PHYSICAL" challenge. Skips 2px to avoid epidemic anti-pattern. | OD-004 confidence encoding + DD-F-016 border system | AD-004 | APPLIED | PASSED — Border-left is flat CSS, no shadows/transforms/3D. Rule 5 inversion: 1px borders are SEMANTIC here |
| EXT-AXIS-SP-003 | Spiral as Angular Approximation (Anti-Physical Spiral) | Implements spiral as polygonal/angular approximation: straight-line segments, right angles, nested rectangles. Soul constraint (border-radius: 0) forces this, which IS geological stratification. No curves, no rounded containers. | Fibonacci spiral adapted per Soul Piece 1 constraint | AD-004 | APPLIED | PASSED — Angular/polygonal spiral uses straight lines and right angles throughout |
| EXT-AXIS-SP-004 | Confidence-Proportional Spacing System | Spacing within each ring correlates with confidence: Established (16px gap, 24px padding), Probable (24px, 32px), Speculative (32px, 48px), Open (48px, 64px). Creates CRESCENDO of whitespace from core to edge. CSS custom properties per stratum. | Confidence gradient + whitespace as design (Rule 6) | AD-004 | APPLIED | PASSED — Pure CSS spacing, whitespace as design element |
| EXT-AXIS-SP-005 | Geological Survey Header as Spiral Map | Dark header (#1A1A1A) contains miniature angular spiral map: nested rectangles with border-weight gradient, active stratum highlighted with --color-primary. Creates DD-F-006 fractal at page scale. Stratum labels in --font-mono at --type-meta. | EXT-CONF-015 dark header + DD-F-006 fractal requirement | AD-004 | APPLIED | PASSED — CSS-only flat graphic, nested rectangles (border-radius: 0) |

**AD-F findings sourced from EXT-AXIS-SP:** AD-F-013 (SP-003), AD-F-014 (SP-002), AD-F-015 (SP-004), AD-F-016 (SP-001, SP-003)

## Category 11: EXT-AXIS-CH (Choreography Research) — 5 Findings

All sourced from research-package-ad-005.md. Applied in AD-005 (Choreography + Spatial Mapping + WAVE/ISLANDS).

| ID | Name | Description | Source | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-AXIS-CH-001 | Cinematic Shot Progression as Axis Choreography Model | Cinematic shot progression (establishing -> medium -> close-up -> wide) provides structural model. Hub overview = horizontal scanning (establishing shot), spoke intro = vertical reading (medium shot), spoke detail = deep vertical (close-up), spoke summary = return to horizontal (wide shot). Each shot transition is an AXIS CHANGE via spacing, typography, and density. | Cinematic language adapted to content structure | AD-005 | APPLIED | PASSED — Structural metaphor, flat CSS (spacing + typography changes) |
| EXT-AXIS-CH-002 | Diagonal Clip-Path as Axis Direction Signal | `clip-path: polygon()` diagonals mark axis direction changes. Top-left to bottom-right = "descending into detail", bottom-left to top-right = "ascending to overview." Like diagonal rules in printed magazines. Max 2-3 per page (R4-134). | Editorial/magazine layout tradition + CSS clip-path | AD-005 | APPLIED | PASSED — Flat 2D CSS masking, straight line (not curved), no box-shadow |
| EXT-AXIS-CH-003 | WAVE Density Oscillation via Hub-Spoke Navigation | Hub-spoke navigation creates natural WAVE: Hub = sparse (overview tiles, generous whitespace, horizontal scan), Spoke = dense (code blocks, vertical reading), Return-to-hub = sparse. Each hub-spoke-hub cycle = one complete wave. | WAVE density pattern + hub-spoke navigation | AD-005 | APPLIED | PASSED — Content architecture, density via content variation not visual effects |
| EXT-AXIS-CH-004 | Flat Progress Indicator for Axis Position | CSS-only horizontal bar with rectangular segments (hub wide, transition narrow, spoke variable). Active segment highlighted with --color-primary. Square markers (Soul Piece 5). No rounded ends, no shadow, no gradient. | Progress indicator UX + Soul Piece 5 (squares) | AD-005 | APPLIED | PASSED — Flat rectangular bar, border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none |
| EXT-AXIS-CH-005 | Responsive Axis Collapse Strategy | Desktop (1440px+): full choreography. Tablet (768-1440px): 4-col -> 2-col, split-screen -> full-width + breadcrumb.

## Category 12: EXT-AXIS-X (Compound Axis Research) — 8 Findings

All sourced from research-package-ad-006.md. Applied in AD-006 (Compound + Creative + ALL density patterns, FRACTAL primary). AD-006 is the CROWN JEWEL of AD, receiving 8 findings (most of any AD domain).

| ID | Name | Description | Source | Applied In | Application Status | Soul Test Result |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EXT-AXIS-X-001 | Compound Axis as Meta-Pattern Demonstration | Triple Equivalence: axis geometry, organizational pattern, and density pattern are THREE perspectives on ONE phenomenon. Visual proof: changing axis pattern changes perceived density AND organization automatically. | DD-F-006 FRACTAL meta-pattern + OD-F-MP-001 (Org=Density) | AD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Conceptual/structural principle, no CSS requirements |
| EXT-AXIS-X-002 | Pattern Transition Grammar | 5x5 transition matrix: smooth transitions (Z-F, Bento-Choreography), bridge transitions (need intermediary), breathing transitions (all Spiral, cross-mechanism). Choreography = universal bridge. Spiral = most isolated (48px+ breathing per OD-F-007). | Information architecture + pattern compatibility theory | AD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — IA principle, governs content structure not visual decoration |
| EXT-AXIS-X-003 | Recursive Pattern Echo Grid | 5-cell pattern echo grid: each cell contains miniature CSS-only visualization of its axis pattern (Z diagonal, F scan, Bento grid, Angular spiral, Hub-spoke arrows). 6th cell = Hofstadterian strange loop (compound grid of itself). Creates DD-F-006 at navigation scale. | EXT-CREATIVE-013 pattern echo + Hofstadter self-reference | AD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Flat CSS graphics, border-radius: 0, no box-shadow, locked colors |
| EXT-AXIS-X-004 | Compound Density Self-Documentation | Persistent annotation: "Current axis: Z-Pattern / Density: PULSE / Organization: Conversational" updates as reader scrolls through compound sections. Makes triple equivalence VISIBLE. --font-mono, --type-meta, intersection observer. | OD-005 WAVE indicator (EXT-SPAT-018) adapted for compound | AD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Uses --font-mono at --type-meta, no animation, square markers |
| EXT-AXIS-X-005 | Compound Fractal Annotation Layer | Extends EXT-CREATIVE-010 to annotate BOTH fractal scale AND axis pattern simultaneously. Two-line annotation per section: Line 1 = fractal scale (PAGE/SECTION/COMPONENT), Line 2 = axis pattern. CSS Grid sidebar column (3rem). | EXT-CREATIVE-010 fractal annotation + DD-F-006 5-scale model | AD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — --font-mono, --type-meta, editorial marginalia tradition |
| EXT-AXIS-X-006 | Culmination Spread Treatment | Opening section uses maximum type scale (amplified --type-page). Miniature retrospective thumbnails of AD-001 through AD-005 as CSS-only pattern echoes. Per-section grid variation matching each source AD's natural layout. | EXT-CREATIVE-011 culmination spread adapted for compound | AD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Amplified typography at TOP of locked scale, flat CSS graphics |
| EXT-AXIS-X-007 | Decision Matrix as Compound Climax | 5x5 decision matrix: rows = content types (landing, tutorial, reference, guide, creative), columns = axis patterns. Ratings as text labels ("Best fit" / "Acceptable" / "Avoid"). Featured cells with 4px left border. No traffic-light color (DD-F-015). | OD-F-013 decision matrices + compound synthesis | AD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Flat table, horizontal rules only, sharp corners, text ratings |
| EXT-AXIS-X-008 | Compound Page as AD-F Finding Generator | Page structure designed to GENERATE findings (emergent behavior at pattern intersections). "Discovery Log" sidebar documenting AD-F findings as they emerge. Each transition point annotated. | OD-006 crown jewel methodology (OD-F-005 generation) | AD-006 | APPLIED | PASSED — Process principle, no CSS implications |

**AD-F findings sourced from EXT-AXIS-X:** AD-F-021 (X-001), AD-F-022 (X-001, X-003), AD-F-023 (X-001, X-004), AD-F-024 (X-002), AD-F-025 (X-002), AD-F-026 (X-008), AD-F-027 (X-005), AD-F-028 (X-005)

## Spirit Violation List (from research-refinement.md)

Findings where EXT research was applied but the implementation introduced spirit violations:

| # | OD(s) | EXT Finding | Violation | Severity | Recommended Fix |
|---|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | OD-001 | EXT-CREATIVE-001 | Semi-transparent offset pseudo-elements (opacity 0.15, 0.3) create colored glow — spirit equivalent of box-shadow | HIGH | Change from `opacity: 0.15/0.3` to `opacity: 1` with palette color, or remove |
| 2 | OD-001,003,004,005,006 | EXT-CREATIVE-001 | Opaque solid offsets creating perceptual depth illusion | MEDIUM | Assess case by case: flat graphic block = acceptable; floating illusion = fails |
| 3 | OD-005 | EXT-CREATIVE-001 (inherited) | `.territory-tile:hover { transform: translate(-4px,-4px) }` creates fake lift/depth | HIGH | Remove transform — content should not behave like interactive button |
| 4 | OD-006 | EXT-CREATIVE-001 (inherited) | `.territory-tile:hover { transform: translate(-2px,-2px) }` creates fake lift/depth | ~~MEDIUM~~ RESOLVED | Replaced with border-color + background-color hover per EXT-CREATIVE-014 (Wave 3) |
| 5 | OD-001,004,006 | EXT-CREATIVE-002 | 3 type scale values (26px, 22px, 10px) deviate from locked type scale | MEDIUM | Map to locked: section 26px->24px, question 22px->20px, meta 10px->12px |

## Raw Directive vs Refined Application

Per research-refinement.md audit:

| Application Type | Count | Percentage |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| Properly REFINED (filtered through soul) | 40 | 85% |
| NEEDS REFINEMENT (applied but issues flagged) | 2 unique findings (EXT-CREATIVE-001, 002) across multiple ODs | 4% |
| PASSED as soul-neutral (no CSS implications) | 38 | 81% |
| PASSED as soul-strengthening | 5 | 11% |
| REJECTED | 0 | 0% |

**Summary from research-refinement.md (COMPACTION-SAFE):**
- EXT-* citations checked: 55
- PASSED: 46
- NEEDS REFINEMENT: 5 instances (2 unique findings across ODs)
- REJECTED: 0
- Raw directive applications found: 7 (3 type scale deviations, 1 off-palette color, 3 off-palette backgrounds)
- Spirit vs Letter violations: 7 total (2 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 1 LOW, 1 universal/accepted)

## Appendix: EXT-CONF Numeric ID Mapping

Since EXT-CONF findings lack numeric suffixes (inconsistency flagged in finding-registry.md line 243), this appendix provides a proposed numeric mapping for consistency:

| Proposed Numeric ID | Current Descriptive ID | Source Resource |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| EXT-CONF-001 | EXT-CONF (NNG Progressive Disclosure) | OD-004-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md Resource 1 |
| EXT-CONF-002 | EXT-CONF (Confidence Visualization) | Resource 2 |
| EXT-CONF-003 | EXT-CONF (Agentic Categorical Labels) | Resource 3 |
| EXT-CONF-004 | EXT-CONF (Gwern Kesselman Vocabulary) | Resource 4 |
| EXT-CONF-005 | EXT-CONF (Appleton Epistemic Disclosure) | Resource 5 |
| EXT-CONF-006 | EXT-CONF (Diataxis) | Resource 6 |
| EXT-CONF-007 | EXT-CONF (Layered Architecture) | Resource 7 |
| EXT-CONF-008 | EXT-CONF (GitBook Adaptive) | Resource 8 |
| EXT-CONF-009 | EXT-CONF (AI Agents Progressive Disclosure) | Resource 9 |
| EXT-CONF-010 | EXT-CONF (NNG Information Scent) | Resource 10 |
| EXT-CONF-011 | EXT-CONF (EA Forum Epistemic) | Resource 11 |
| EXT-CONF-012 | EXT-CONF (Stripe Docs) | Resource 12 |

**Note:** This numeric mapping is now CANONICAL (elevated from PROPOSED by researcher-3a in Wave 3 re-enrichment, per research-package-od-004.md). EXT-CONF-001 through EXT-CONF-012 are the authoritative numeric IDs. EXT-CONF-013 through EXT-CONF-018 continue the numeric sequence with Wave 3 additions.

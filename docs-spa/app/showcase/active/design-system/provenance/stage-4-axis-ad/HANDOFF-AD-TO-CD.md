# HANDOFF: AD → CD
## CD Reads This FIRST at Phase 0

===============================================================================
## PURPOSE
===============================================================================

This document transfers everything CD needs from AD's completed state. AD
completed 4 phases: convention+research (Phase 0), 3-wave build with identity
loop (Phase 1), 24+-agent multi-dimensional audit (Phase 2), fix execution with
programmatic+visual verification (Phase 3), and synthesis+infrastructure (Phase 4).

The central discovery: **axis geometry IS density IS organization** — three names
for one phenomenon. The 3-way unification is VALIDATED through 5 distinct
equivalence mechanisms (temporal, spatial, proportional, kinetic, gravitational).
The meta-equivalence is ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (AD-F-023).

CD's mission: test whether COMBINATIONS of these validated patterns maintain
the equivalence or reveal new dynamics at the combination scale.

===============================================================================
## GATE FINDING FOR CD
===============================================================================

**DD-F-012 was AD's gate finding.** It stated: "Density patterns imply axis preferences." AD validated this through 6 explorations and ELEVATED it: axis does not merely serve density — axis IS density expressed spatially.

**AD's gate finding for CD is DD-F-013:** "Component density tolerance — how much density variation can a single component absorb before it needs to split into multiple components." CD must answer this at the combination scale: when two axis patterns combine, do their components maintain density tolerance or require splitting?

Additionally, AD-F-024 (compound is sequential) and AD-F-025 (transition grammar) are MANDATORY constraints for CD. Any combination that violates the sequential principle or lacks transition grammar between zones is INVALID.

===============================================================================
## PRIMARY RESEARCH FOR CD
===============================================================================

**R-5 (Combination Theory)** is CD's primary research. AD consumed R-5 partially in the compound context (AD-006). CD must consume R-5 fully.

**R-4 (Axis Innovations)** remains secondary. CD may need axis-specific findings when implementing combination layouts.

**EXT-CD-* (Extended Research)** should be commissioned during Phase 0 for:
- Combination layout patterns
- Multi-axis co-existence strategies
- Transition grammar extensions
- Component density tolerance testing

===============================================================================
## 3-WAY UNIFICATION — WHAT CD INHERITS
===============================================================================

The transitive chain is now COMPLETE:

```
DD (Density) → OD (Organization) → AD (Axis)
     ↓              ↓                  ↓
  8 patterns    6 patterns         6 patterns
     ↓              ↓                  ↓
  DD-F-###      OD-F-###           AD-F-###
     ↓              ↓                  ↓
 "Visual rhythm"  "Cognitive rhythm" "Spatial rhythm"
                    ↓                  ↓
              OD-F-005: "org IS    AD-F-004: "axis IS
               density"              density IS org"
                                       ↓
                                 AD-F-023: "All are
                                  ATTENTION TOPOLOGY"
```

CD operates at the TOP of this chain. Every combination must maintain the
3-way equivalence. A combination that breaks the equivalence is INVALID.

===============================================================================
## SOUL COMPLIANCE
===============================================================================

5 soul pieces remain LOCKED. No 6th was discovered (AD-F-028 confirms).

| # | Soul Piece | AD Status |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | border-radius: 0 | 0 violations across 3,190 DOM elements |
| 2 | No filter: drop-shadow() | 0 violations |
| 3 | Instrument Serif + Inter + JetBrains Mono | Verified after document.fonts.ready |
| 4 | box-shadow: none | 0 violations (3 fixed during audit) |
| 5 | Muted earth palette | 0 off-palette colors |

CD must maintain 0 violations. The convention spec (AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md)
and template (AD-SOUL-TEMPLATE.html) can be reused as the base for CD's
locked layer.

===============================================================================
## ANTI-PATTERNS — WHAT AD CONFIRMED
===============================================================================

| Anti-Pattern | AD Compliance |
|-------------|---------------|
| Rounded corners | 0 violations |
| Drop shadows | 0 violations |
| 2px border epidemic (OD-F-AP-001) | 0 violations (1 caught and fixed during audit) |
| Traffic-light adjacency | Verified per DD-F-015 |
| Callout cacophony | Max 2 per section (DD-F-014) |
| Semi-transparent backgrounds | 0 rgba with alpha < 1.0 |

===============================================================================
## CONVENTION SPEC — AD'S CONTRIBUTION
===============================================================================

AD created AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (822 lines, 16 sections):
- Sections 1-11: INHERITED from OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md
- Sections 12-16: AD-SPECIFIC (axis grid systems, axis zone tokens, responsive behavior, soul-compliant transitions, accessibility)

CD should:
1. Inherit sections 1-16 from AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md
2. Add sections 17-20: CD-SPECIFIC (combination rules, transition grammar, component density tolerance, combination accessibility)

===============================================================================
## OPEN ESCALATIONS
===============================================================================

Two locked convention conflicts surfaced during perceptual audit and remain
unresolved. CD must determine resolution before building compound layouts.

| Escalation ID | Description | Convention Reference | Recommendation |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| ESC-001 | **Lock-vs-lock conflict: responsive breakpoint vs bento pattern.** S12.5 mandates single-column collapse at 768px, but AD-F-009 (bento grid CONTAINS islands) requires multi-column to function. AD-006 bento zones broke destructively between 768-960px. | S12.5 (LOCKED) vs AD-F-009 (LOCKED) | Move collapse to ~960px for 4+-column grids. CD must validate whether 960px is the right threshold for compound layouts or if pattern-specific overrides are needed. |
| ESC-002 | **Scroll-reveal interpretation: progressive enhancement vs content gate.** S15.3 requires content in DOM for progressive enhancement, but AD explorations used scroll-reveal that hid 40-60% of content when animations failed. Content was in the DOM (letter of S15.3 honored) but invisible (spirit violated). | S15.3 (LOCKED) | Initial CSS state MUST render content visible. JavaScript MAY add hidden state for reveal effect. AD-006 fix applied this resolution; CD should adopt as standard. |

===============================================================================
## SHIP STATUS
===============================================================================

Per-page verdicts after perceptual audit (PA) and fix execution:

| AD | Pattern | Initial Verdict | Final Verdict | Notes |
|----|---------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| AD-001 | Z-Pattern | SHIP WITH CONCERNS | **SHIP** (post-fix) | Width 860->1100px, footer added, dead space reduced |
| AD-002 | F-Pattern | **DO NOT SHIP** | **SHIP** (post-fix) | Empty Acts IV-V resolved, width 860->1100px (DM-042) |
| AD-003 | Bento Grid | SHIP WITH CONCERNS | **SHIP** (post-fix) | Grid collapse fixed at 769px, width 860->1100px |
| AD-004 | Spiral | SHIP WITH CONCERNS | **SHIP** (post-fix) | Blank zones reduced, footer added, width 860->1100px |
| AD-005 | Choreography | **DO NOT SHIP** | **SHIP** (post-fix) | Dead zones halved, interstitials added, footer added (DM-042) |
| AD-006 | Compound | **DO NOT SHIP** | **SHIP** (post-fix) | Scroll-reveal defense, bento 960px collapse, footer bookend (DM-042) |

**3 pages were initially DO-NOT-SHIP:** AD-002 (empty Acts IV-V), AD-005
(excessive dead zones, no ending), AD-006 (scroll-reveal content gate + bento
collapse). All issues were resolved during PA fix execution (commits 315784d
through a231977). Container width was universally updated from 860px to 1100px
across all 6 pages based on unanimous perceptual evidence + user validation.

===============================================================================
## KNOWN QUALITY PATTERNS -- Internal Dialect Warning
===============================================================================

**DM-007: Internal quality dialect within pages.**

The OD audit identified 3 quality dialects ACROSS pages (Polished: OD-001/002,
Functional: OD-003/004/005, Editorial: OD-006). The perceptual audit discovered
quality variation WITHIN individual pages as well:

- AD-003: "I would put my name on the top third" but lower sections feel less
  polished (CBB-1 finding)
- AD-004: Comparison panels feel "borrowed" from a different design sensibility
  (CBB-5 finding)

CD should be aware this intra-page dialectal variation exists. Treat as
acceptable range for AD explorations, not defect -- but compound pages at CD
scale should maintain internal consistency. The convention spec was authored
pre-build to prevent cross-page dialect drift, but within-page variation is a
different phenomenon requiring visual review.

===============================================================================
## SYSTEMIC vs SOVEREIGN FINDINGS
===============================================================================

**DM-012: Classification of which AD findings recur across all pages (systemic)
vs page-specific (sovereign).**

### Systemic Findings (recur across multiple/all ADs -- CD WILL encounter these)

| Finding | Pages Affected | CD Implication |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Container width too narrow (860px) | All 6 | RESOLVED: widened to 1100px. CD should use 1100px. |
| No visual ending / footer | All 6 | RESOLVED: footers added. CD MUST include footer/capstone. |
| Dead space / excessive whitespace | All 6 | Breathing zone budget: 15% minimum, 25% maximum ceiling. |
| Responsive collapse at 768px | All 6 | Test at 768px AND 900px (bento breaks earlier). |
| Dark code block contrast | 5 of 6 | Convention-compliant dark code blocks required. |
| Soul compliance (0 violations) | All 6 | MAINTAINED through fixes. CD must match. |

### Sovereign Findings (page-specific -- CD may not encounter)

| Finding | Page | Nature |
|---------|------|--------|
| Z-sweep shallowness | AD-001 | Z-pattern specific diagonal perception |
| Code block truncation | AD-003 | Bento cell sizing specific |
| Invisible border at viewport edge | AD-004 | Spiral-specific border rendering |
| Hub-spoke transition inconsistency | AD-005 | Choreography-specific navigation |
| Internal quality dialect variation | AD-003, AD-004 | Per-page design consistency |

===============================================================================
## STRENGTHS TO PROTECT
===============================================================================

**DM-014: Confirmed positive findings that CD must not break.**

These were independently confirmed by multiple perceptual auditors:

| Strength | Source | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Soul compliance** (0 violations across ~3,479 elements) | All 6 audit reports + comprehensive audit | The identity is real and enforced |
| **Transition grammar** (5x5 matrix validated) | AD-F-025, AD-006 audit | Transitions between density zones follow validated grammar |
| **ATTENTION TOPOLOGY meta-equivalence** | AD-F-023, AD-005/006 auditors | The 3-way unification is VISIBLE, not just structural |
| **Border weight as geological encoding** (4px/3px/1px) | AD-F-014, AD-004 auditors (both called it "crown jewel" and "genuine design innovation") | Flat 2D encoding of depth WITHOUT depth cues |
| **Typography velocity** (serif Q / sans A creates PULSE) | AD-001/002 auditors | The Q&A rhythm is perceptually confirmed |
| **Header authority** (dark full-bleed + 3px red) | All auditors | Creates strongest LANDMARK regardless of axis pattern |
| **"Scholarly, Deliberate, Warm" personality** | AD-006 auditors (at 1440px and 1024px) | The design intent IS perceived by independent observers |
| **Warm palette cohesion** | All auditors | Muted earth tones create consistent environmental feel |

===============================================================================
## 768px VIEWPORT WARNING
===============================================================================

**DM-013: 768px is the consistent failure point across all AD explorations.**

Across all 6 pages:
- **1440px:** Consistently good -- design intent fully realized
- **1024px:** Often the sweet spot -- content density optimizes naturally
- **768px:** Where problems concentrate -- responsive collapse, bento
  destruction, dead space multiplication, content truncation

**Critical nuance:** Some layouts break BEFORE 768px. AD-006's bento zones
broke at ~900px, not 768px. AD-003's grid collapses needed adjustment at 769px.

**CD mandatory gate:** Test compound layouts at **900px, 768px, AND 480px**.
The 768px breakpoint alone is insufficient -- compound layouts combining bento
and other patterns may fail at higher viewports.

===============================================================================
## DEFERRED RESEARCH
===============================================================================

**GAP-016: 7 R-2 findings deferred from AD to CD, listed by finding ID.**

AD consumed R-2 findings per-exploration but flagged 7 for CD-level re-evaluation,
as combination contexts may change how they apply:

| R-2 ID | Description | Why Deferred | CD Application |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| R2-1.1 | Breaking the Grid (Intentional Mess) | AD consumed individually; CD must evaluate grid-breaking across COMBINED patterns | Evaluate whether intentional grid breaks in one axis pattern conflict with adjacent combined patterns |
| R2-2.4 | Analytical Dashboard Storylines | AD consumed for AD-002/004/006; CD must evaluate cross-pattern storyline composition | When Z + F + Spiral combine, do their individual storylines merge or conflict? |
| R2-3.3 | Experimental Namespace (Kitchen) | AD consumed for AD-006 only; CD must evaluate whether experimental combinations graduate | Does the "kitchen" concept apply to CD compound pages? |
| R2-4.2 | Asymmetric / Broken Grid | AD consumed for 3 ADs; CD must evaluate asymmetry in COMBINED layouts | Asymmetric bento + F-pattern -- does asymmetry compound or cancel? |
| R2-4.4 | Golden Ratio (PARTIAL PASS) | Layout proportions consumed; TYPOGRAPHY application REJECTED (deviates from locked type scale) | CD may find golden ratio layout proportions useful for combination page sectioning |
| R2-6.1 | Split Screen Layouts | AD consumed for AD-001/004/005; CD must evaluate split-screen in compound layouts | Can split-screen serve as a combination container (left axis = A, right axis = B)? |
| R2-6.3 | Scrollytelling for Documentation | AD consumed for AD-002/004/005; CD must evaluate scroll-driven reveal across combined pages | Does scrollytelling work when the reveal traverses multiple axis patterns? |

**Full R-2 mapping:** `knowledge-architecture/_ad-execution/r2-ad-mapping.md` (200 lines)
**Full R-4 evaluation:** `knowledge-architecture/_ad-execution/R-4-AD-EVALUATION.md` (429 lines)

===============================================================================
## AD EXPLORATION PATHS
===============================================================================

CD agents building combinations of axis patterns need to READ the validated
HTML artifacts. Explicit file paths:

```
explorations/axis/AD-001-z-pattern.html       (Z-Pattern, 36/40)
explorations/axis/AD-002-f-pattern.html       (F-Pattern, 35/40)
explorations/axis/AD-003-bento-grid.html      (Bento Grid, 37/40)
explorations/axis/AD-004-spiral.html          (Spiral, 36/40)
explorations/axis/AD-005-choreography.html    (Choreography, 35/40)
explorations/axis/AD-006-compound.html        (Compound, 38/40)
```

All paths relative to `docs-spa/app/showcase/`. Total ~467KB of validated HTML.
Each exploration demonstrates one axis pattern integrated with its paired density
pattern(s) and organizational pattern. CD must study these before combining them.

===============================================================================
## AUDIT METHODOLOGY NOTE
===============================================================================

AD explorations were audited using the Perceptual Audit Skill (v2, later
redesigned to v3 based on AD execution lessons). The methodology uses a
3-layer architecture:

1. **Layer 1: Binary Gates** -- 7 mandatory pass/fail gates (Playwright alive,
   screenshots exist, cold look locked, perceptual language clean, systemic
   synthesis complete, fix trigger activated, independent verification)
2. **Layer 2: Structured Judgment** -- 28 perceptual questions (PA-01 through
   PA-28) across 3 tiers, organized by severity
3. **Layer 3: Free Perception** -- Unconstrained auditor observations with
   sovereignty classification (SYSTEMIC vs SOVEREIGN)

Results: 6/6 pages SHIP after fixes. Multi-agent architecture: 2+ independent
auditors per page, concordance tracking, adversarial cross-examination.

**Skill reference:** `~/.claude/skills/perceptual-auditing/` (GATES.md,
PROTOCOL.md, TEAM.md)
**Skill evolution analysis:** `explorations/axis/_perceptual-audit/_skill-evolution/SYNTHESIS.md`

===============================================================================
## CONVENTION IDEOLOGY REFERENCE
===============================================================================

For the reasoning behind every AD convention, including perceptual evidence,
authority levels (ALWAYS-LOCKED / LOCKED / CHALLENGEABLE), and the decision
classification framework (81 decisions across 3 tiers), see:

**AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md** in this directory
(`provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md`)

This document captures the convention ideology -- not just WHAT the rules are
(that is in AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md) but WHY each rule exists, what perceptual
evidence supports it, and under what conditions it may be challenged. CD agents
should read this to understand the reasoning behind constraints they inherit.

**AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md** (822 lines, 16 sections):
`knowledge-architecture/_ad-execution/AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md`

**Lock sheet** (81 decisions, 3 tiers):
`explorations/axis/_perceptual-audit/lock-sheet.md`

===============================================================================
## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR CD
===============================================================================

1. **Combination density tolerance:** When two axis patterns combine (e.g., Z-Pattern + Bento Grid), does the combined component absorb both density patterns or require splitting?
2. **Transition grammar scaling:** AD-F-025 validated grammar for transitions within a single compound page. Does the grammar hold when transitions occur between separate combined pages?
3. **Attention topology at combination scale:** AD-F-023 described attention topology for individual axis patterns. How do attention topologies compose when multiple patterns operate on the same page?
4. **Sequential vs parallel combinations:** AD-F-024 showed compound density is sequential. Are there combination patterns that genuinely operate in parallel?
5. **Fractal at combination scale:** DD-F-006 confirmed at 5 scales. Does combination create a 6th scale (meta-combination) or is 5 the hard limit?

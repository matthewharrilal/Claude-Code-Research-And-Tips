# CLAUDE.md — Active Zone

## Identity

**Active zones contain work-in-progress and forward pipeline resources.**

These files are either actively being developed, pending re-audit, or serving the forward pipeline (migration, composition, design system evolution).

## Contents

| Directory | Files | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| `axis/` | 194 | AD explorations | RE-AUDIT REQUIRED (path error in 3x audit) |
| `pipeline/` | 17 | POST-CD planning suite | Strategic + tension synthesis docs |
| `design-system/` | 58 | Tokens, patterns, provenance | 37 provenance files = living chain |
| `research/` | 7 | R1-R5 + synthesis | Primary research findings (337 total) |

## Key Files

### Pipeline (Start Here for Forward Work)
- `pipeline/README.md` — comprehensive overview
- `pipeline/01-CD-EVOLVED-VISION.md` through `09-EXTRACTION-VALIDATION-PROTOCOL.md`
- `pipeline/TENSION-PROTOCOL.md` — tension analysis synthesis
- `pipeline/tension-deep-dive.md` — deep tension analysis

### Design System (Soul Enforcers)
- `design-system/tokens/geometry.md` — border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none (LOCKED)
- `design-system/tokens/typography.md` — Instrument Serif, Inter, JetBrains Mono
- `design-system/tokens/spacing.md` — 4px-96px scale, INHALE/EXHALE rhythm
- `design-system/tokens/colors.md` — #E83025, #FEF9F5, #1A1A1A, #E0D5C5

### Research
- `research/R1-DOCUMENTATION-PATTERNS.md` through `R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md`
- `research/RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md` — cross-research insights

## Notes

- `axis/` needs re-audit: the 3x audit agents audited the wrong directory path
- `design-system/provenance/` methodology is CONTESTED: stage-based vs top-level supersession
- Pipeline `_*` prefixed files have been archived; synthesis docs remain

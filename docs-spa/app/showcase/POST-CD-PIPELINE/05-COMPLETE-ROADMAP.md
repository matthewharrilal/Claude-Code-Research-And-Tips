# 05 — COMPLETE ROADMAP: CD Through Full Migration

**Document:** Full timeline with phase breakdown, effort estimates, and the freeze line guarantee
**Scope:** Every step from CD initiation to full design system adoption
**Sources:** _SOURCE-BRIEF.md (Sections 9-10), 09-complete-roadmap.md (569 lines), 10-MIGRATION-SYNTHESIS.md (780 lines)

## THE DESTINATION IN ONE PARAGRAPH

The KortAI design system moves from validated research to fully adopted documentation through 8 phases spanning approximately 34-68 hours across 8-13 sessions. The first 7 phases (CD through Playbook Refinement) complete the design system and build the migration infrastructure. A non-negotiable freeze line then locks the system permanently. The final phase migrates all 75+ documentation pages using only what exists above the freeze line. Every page will look different -- not from randomness, but because different content types produce different attention topologies through the 3-way equivalence (AD-F-023). The result: 75 siblings who share DNA but have distinct faces.

## PHASE-BY-PHASE BREAKDOWN

### Phase A: CD (Combination Dimension) -- 4-5 hours

**Status:** PENDING. Fully planned. HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD exists and is complete.
**Team:** ~18-20 agents
**Dependency:** HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md (exists)

**What it produces:**
- 6 HTML explorations (CD-001 through CD-006) testing pattern combinations
- CD-006 uses REAL documentation content -- the insurance policy that proves the system handles actual pages
- 15-25 CD-F findings (combination rules validated empirically)
- CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (FINAL convention spec -- extends AD sections 1-16, adds 17-20, no further sections)
- CD-RESEARCH-GATE.md (R-5 evaluation -- 39 findings, ~75-80% currently unapplied)
- ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 (TERMINAL identity document -- there is no v4)
- HANDOFF-CD-TO-MIGRATION.md (expanded into a playbook with pattern selection guide)
- Validated/extended transition grammar (5x5 matrix from AD)
- Completeness Gate passed

**Completeness Gate (all must be YES before CD declares done):**
- Every component used in at least one CD exploration
- Every R-5 combination rule validated, extended, or explicitly deferred
- Density tolerance table complete (no "unknown" entries)
- Transition grammar covers all pattern boundaries
- CD-006 pilot migration completed without requiring design system updates
- Known limitations documented with migration workarounds

**What inherits into CD (mandatory consumed):**
- 84 prior findings: 21 COMP-F, 18 DD-F, 17 OD-F, 28 AD-F
- 20 documented patterns
- R-5 Combination Theory (39 findings)
- 27 R-2 findings (~67% applied during AD)
- Accumulated Identity v2
- 5 soul pieces, 4 combination rules, 3-way equivalence (AD-F-023)

---

### Phase B+D: Component Extraction + Pattern Library -- 6-10 hours

**Status:** NOT STARTED. Not previously planned in any document.
**Team:** ~6-10 agents across 2 sessions
**Dependency:** Phase A (needs CD's combination rules)

This is the "printing press" phase -- the bridge between 15,000 lines of research prose and implementable code. Without it, every migrated page reinvents pattern implementation from scratch by reading exploration HTML source.

**What it produces:**
- Layout components encoding density patterns (CrescendoSection, PulseSection, IslandsSection, GeologicalSection, TidalSection, FractalContainer)
- Transition components implementing AD-F-025 (SmoothTransition, BridgeTransition, BreathingTransition)
- Combination recipe templates (R5's validated recipes as copyable HTML/CSS structures)
- Reusable "KortAI page template" with soul-compliant defaults (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none, correct fonts, warm cream background)
- Pattern picker decision tree: Content Type -> Pattern Set -> Implementation Template
- Per-pattern documentation with "copy this structure" blocks

**What it does NOT produce:**
- New design decisions (all patterns come from validated explorations)
- Full React component library (that remains the existing docs-spa component library's job)

**Why this matters for the freeze guarantee:** Without extraction, migration agents must read ~15,000 lines of provenance documentation to understand what to build. With extraction, they follow a recipe and apply a template. The design system does not need updating because the primitives ARE the system expressed as code rather than prose.

**Token fix (30 minutes):** Fix 3-4 known contradictions in design-system/src/styles/tokens.css against T1 authority. Can run in parallel with this phase.

---

### Phase F: Content Analysis -- 2-4 hours

**Status:** NOT STARTED. No page inventory exists.
**Team:** ~3-5 agents
**Dependency:** Phase A (needs CD's pattern vocabulary). Can partially overlap with Phase B+D.

**What it produces:**
- Complete inventory of all 75+ docs-spa pages
- Per-page content type classification (tutorial, reference, getting started, conceptual, hybrid, etc.)
- Per-page pattern recommendation (org + density + axis + combination triple)
- Per-page migration complexity estimate (1=simple token swap, 2=moderate restructuring, 3=major rewrite)
- Migration priority ranking (suggested order)
- Content gaps identified (pages needing new content, not just restyling)
- Content types that don't fit any validated pattern (must be resolved HERE, not during migration)

**Why this is critical:** You cannot migrate what you have not inventoried. The existing 75 pages follow an identical 8-section HTML template, but migration differentiates them based on CONTENT TYPE (what the reader needs), not current structure (what the HTML looks like). Content classification is deterministic from the accumulated identity:

| Content Type | Organization | Density | Axis | Feels Like |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "How do I do X?" (steps) | Task-Based | ISLANDS + BOOKENDS | Bento Grid | Recipe cards on counter |
| "How does X work?" (progressive) | Narrative | CRESCENDO | F-Pattern | A well-paced article |
| "What is X?" (Q&A) | Conversational | PULSE + TIDAL | Z-Pattern | Interview transcript |
| "Should I use X?" (evaluation) | Confidence-Based | GEOLOGICAL | Spiral | Geological cross-section |
| "What's available?" (map) | Spatial | WAVE + ISLANDS | Choreography | Museum floor plan |
| Multiple of above | Creative | ALL (FRACTAL) | Compound | Magazine feature |

**Overlap potential:** Classification can start while the pattern library is being built. Classification does not require the library -- only pattern ASSIGNMENT does. Starting early saves 1-2 hours on the critical path.

---

### Phase E: Migration Playbook v2 -- 3-4 hours

**Status:** PARTIAL. A 265-line CSS-only migration guide exists but covers approximately 10% of what is needed. It predates OD, AD, and CD entirely.
**Team:** ~2-3 agents
**Dependency:** Phase B+D (pattern library provides implementation recipes) + Phase F (content analysis provides the page inventory)

**What it produces:**

1. **Migration Execution Spec** -- comprehensive spec for the one-time migration project (~1,400 lines), comparable to the Master AD Execution Spec. Team structure, task decomposition, quality gates, per-phase instructions.

2. **Ingestion Operational Spec** -- lightweight single-agent spec for processing new pages on an ongoing basis (~50-100 lines). Derivative of #1, stripped to what one agent needs to handle a single page cold.

**The Execution Spec includes:**
- Complete 6-phase per-page pipeline (Analysis -> Selection -> Composition -> Build -> Audit -> Document)
- Decision tree with worked examples for each content type
- Escalation protocol for edge cases (without requiring design system updates)
- Post-migration verification checklist covering all 4 dimensions (density + org + axis + combination)
- Migration provenance template (Consumption Receipt format)
- Component chemistry validation (velocity, temperature, weight, spacing rules)

**Why this replaces the existing guide:** After the 3-way unification discovery (axis = organization = density = ATTENTION TOPOLOGY), migration is content architecture redesign informed by 84+ findings, not a CSS reskinning exercise. The existing guide covers CSS reset and callout conversion -- Step 1 of a 6-step process.

---

### Phase G: Pilot Migration -- 3-5 hours

**Status:** NOT STARTED. No pilot concept exists in any document.
**Team:** ~3-5 agents (3-agent team per page: Analyst + Builder + Auditor)
**Dependency:** Phase E (playbook) + Phase F (content analysis identifies which pages to pilot)

**What it produces:**
- 2-3 fully migrated pages spanning different content types:
  - One tutorial/narrative (tests CRESCENDO + F-Pattern)
  - One reference/task-based (tests ISLANDS + Bento Grid)
  - One hybrid/creative (tests compound patterns + transition grammar)
- Validated migration process: does the playbook actually work end-to-end?
- Timing data: how long does a single page migration take? (Critical for estimating Phase I)
- Discovered edge cases and playbook gaps
- First MIG-F findings (migration-specific discoveries)

**Why 2-3 pages specifically:**
- 1 page is too few -- cannot distinguish page-specific issues from systemic ones
- 5+ pages starts to feel like "just do the migration" without the benefit of a controlled test
- 2-3 pages covering different content types provides enough signal to validate the process across the variety spectrum

**Team structure:** The 3-agent separation (Analyst, Builder, Auditor) breaks continuation bias -- the same mechanism that made the Two-Instance pattern effective throughout prior phases.

---

### Phase H: Playbook Refinement -- 1-2 hours

**Status:** NOT STARTED.
**Team:** ~1 agent
**Dependency:** Phase G (pilot results)

**What it produces:**
- Playbook v2.1 incorporating every pilot learning
- Updated time estimates based on actual migration effort (not theoretical)
- Refined escalation protocol based on actual edge cases encountered
- Updated verification checklist if pilot revealed gaps
- Ingestion Operational Spec finalized (derivative of battle-tested playbook)

This is the last phase where the design system can change. After this, the freeze line activates.

---

## THE FREEZE LINE

### The User's Non-Negotiable

> "Once we start migrating actual documentation pages, I don't want to have to update the design system or anything like it. I want all this work, all these layerings, all these weeks of work to be what it is."

This is not a suggestion. It is the architectural spine of the entire roadmap. Every phase before the freeze line is load-bearing infrastructure that makes this guarantee achievable.

### Why This Works

Two structural reasons make the freeze guarantee viable rather than aspirational:

**Reason 1: The intermediate phases build the bridge.** By migration start, the team has: extracted components, a complete content inventory, a tested playbook, and 2-3 pilot pages proving the pipeline works. The gap between "design research" and "migrated page" has been systematically closed before migration begins.

**Reason 2: The accumulated identity gives REASONING, not just rules.** When rules do not cover a case, reasoning still does. ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 is designed so agents can make NEW decisions consistent with prior ones because the system teaches HOW TO THINK about design, not just WHAT TO DO. This is the escape valve that prevents edge cases from forcing design system updates.

### What Is Frozen vs. What Can Evolve

**FROZEN (cannot change after Phase H):**
- Token values (colors, spacing, typography, geometry)
- Soul pieces (5, bounded): sharp edges, archivist serif, warm palette, no shadows, generous whitespace
- Pattern definitions (all density, organizational, axis, and combination patterns)
- Finding IDs and their meanings (84+ DD/OD/AD findings + 15-25 CD findings)
- Convention spec (all sections, including CD additions)
- Anti-pattern registry
- Transition grammar (5x5 matrix, validated/extended by CD)
- Fractal scale model (5 scales, bounded)
- ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3

**NOT FROZEN (can evolve during migration):**
- Implementation details (CSS class names, HTML structures, component internals)
- Playbook wording and examples
- Page classifications (a page can be re-classified if content analysis was wrong)
- Migration priority order
- Verification checklists (can add items, not remove)
- Application notes (new documented uses of existing patterns)
- Provenance documentation format

The distinction: **WHAT the system says** is frozen. **HOW we implement and document what the system says** can evolve.

### When Migration Discovers a Genuine Gap

Three scenarios, in order of likelihood:

**Scenario 1 (Most Likely): Content does not perfectly fit a pattern.**
Resolution: Use the escalation protocol from the playbook. Apply closest match + document the imperfection. The design system is a framework for reasoning, not a template for every possible page.

**Scenario 2 (Possible): A combination was never tested.**
Resolution: Use CD's combination rules + the accumulated identity's reasoning framework to derive the answer. The system teaches how to think, so new decisions remain consistent with prior ones. This IS the system working as intended.

**Scenario 3 (Unlikely): A genuine contradiction in the system.**
Resolution: Document the contradiction. Apply the rule from the highest-authority source (soul > findings > patterns > convention spec). File the contradiction as KNOWN-ISSUE in provenance. Do not update the design system.

None of these scenarios require updating the system. They all work WITHIN what exists.

---

### Phase I+J: Full Migration + Integrated Verification -- 15-40 hours

**Status:** NOT STARTED.
**Team:** ~5-15 agents per session, 3-8 sessions
**Dependency:** Phase H (refined playbook)

**What it produces:**
- All 75+ docs-spa pages migrated to full KortAI design system compliance
- Per-page provenance documentation (Consumption Receipt citing applied findings)
- Soul compliance: 0 violations across all pages
- Pattern fidelity verified per page
- Fractal self-similarity confirmed at 5 scales per page
- MIG-F findings documenting per-page discoveries
- Updated RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md showing pattern usage counts

**Team topology scales with batch size:**

| Pages per Session | Topology |
|---|---|
| 1-3 | Single agent, all 6 phases sequentially |
| 4-10 | Lead + 2-3 Page Teams (Analyst + Builder + Auditor) + Weaver |
| 11-30 | Lead + Captains (groups of 3-4 Page Teams) + Weaver |
| 30+ | Hierarchical: Lead -> Captains -> Page Teams -> Weaver cascade |

**Verification is integrated, not separate.** Each page is audited during migration (Build -> Audit -> Fix -> Move on). A separate "audit everything at the end" phase introduces risk because fixes cascade through shared CSS. The existing pipeline audits DURING each stage, and migration follows the same model.

**The compounding effect:** Each migration generates outbound findings (MIG-F). Page 1 is pure vocabulary application. By page 50, the team has accumulated 20 refinements, 3 extensions, and 2 new recipes -- not by changing the system, but by documenting how existing patterns apply to real content. The design system's effective vocabulary GROWS through migration.

---

## THE VARIETY EXPECTATION

The user explicitly expects every page to look different. This is not an aesthetic preference -- it is an architectural consequence.

Three forces prevent uniform output:

**Force 1: Content classification is the entry point.** Different content types enter through different doors and never converge. A tutorial gets CRESCENDO (building momentum); a reference gets ISLANDS (discrete lookup). They can no more look alike than a river can look like a lake.

**Force 2: Fractal self-similarity looks DIFFERENT per pattern.** F-Pattern "sparse" = generous 64px padding and large headings. Bento Grid "sparse" = empty grid cells and wide gaps. Same principle, visually different at every scale.

**Force 3: Component combination variety.** Even within the same archetype, pages differ based on component count and sequencing. A tutorial with 6 code blocks looks different from a tutorial with 3 code blocks and 5 callouts -- even though both use CRESCENDO + F-Pattern.

What stays constant (the family DNA): border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none, warm cream background, Sanrok red accent, Instrument Serif for wisdom, Inter for body, JetBrains Mono for code, callout family DNA, fractal self-similarity.

What varies (the individual personality): organizational structure, density rhythm, axis geometry, component selection, spacing trajectory, reading flow direction, typography compression, section transitions.

The result is comparable to The Economist magazine: feature spreads, data visualizations, short columns, photo essays -- every article looks different, but they all unmistakably belong to the same publication.

---

## THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT

The user requires heavy documentation so that no future Claude instance or human operates from inference. Everything explicit, everything organized, everything navigable.

This requirement is satisfied by the pipeline's own structure:

- **CD produces** ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 (the terminal reasoning document) + Convention Spec + pattern selection guide
- **Component Extraction produces** implementation recipes with "copy this structure" blocks
- **Content Analysis produces** per-page classification cards
- **Migration Playbook produces** the complete process specification
- **Pilot Migration produces** worked examples (the most powerful form of documentation)
- **Each migrated page produces** a Consumption Receipt documenting what was applied and why

By migration's end, every design decision across every page is traceable back to a finding ID, a pattern definition, or a reasoning step in the accumulated identity. No inference. No "the previous agent probably meant X." Explicit provenance for every choice.

---

## CRITICAL PATH AND PARALLELIZATION

### The Critical Path (Sequential)

```
CD --> Component Extraction + Pattern Library --> Playbook v2 --> Pilot --> Refinement --> Full Migration
```

Each phase depends on the prior phase's outputs. No shortcuts.

### What Can Be Parallelized

1. **Token fix** (30 min) can happen ANY time before migration
2. **Content Analysis** can start as soon as CD is done -- classification does not require the pattern library, only pattern ASSIGNMENT does
3. **Tooling** (if built) can happen in parallel with anything after the pilot
4. **Training** (if needed) can happen in parallel with anything after the pattern library

### Realistic Session Breakdown

| Session | Phases | Wall Time |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Session 1 | CD Phase 0-1 (conventions + first 3 explorations) | ~4 hours |
| Session 2 | CD Phase 1-4 (remaining explorations + audit + synthesis) | ~4-5 hours |
| Session 3 | Component Extraction + Pattern Library | ~5-6 hours |
| Session 4 | Content Analysis + Playbook v2 | ~5-6 hours |
| Session 5 | Pilot Migration (2-3 pages) + Playbook Refinement | ~4-5 hours |
| | **FREEZE LINE** | |
| Session 6+ | Full Migration (batched) | ~15-40 hours (3-8 sessions) |
| **Total** | **8-13 sessions** | **~34-68 hours** |

### Timeline Scenarios

| Scenario | Total Hours | Sessions | Calendar Time |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Optimistic** | ~34 hours | 8 sessions | 2-3 weeks |
| **Realistic** | ~50 hours | 11 sessions | 3-4 weeks |
| **Pessimistic** | ~68 hours | 15 sessions | 4-6 weeks |

**What drives variance:**
- Page count in docs-spa (Phase F reveals this precisely)
- CD discoveries (surprising findings could require additional exploration)
- Pilot results (clean pilot = fast progression; problematic pilot = more preparation)
- Migration parallelism (how many pages can be migrated simultaneously per session)

---

## RISK FACTORS AND DEPENDENCIES

### Dependencies Between Phases

| Phase | Depends On | What It Needs From Predecessor |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| B+D (Extraction) | A (CD) | Combination rules, validated recipes, completeness gate results |
| F (Content Analysis) | A (CD) | Pattern vocabulary for classification. Partial overlap possible. |
| E (Playbook) | B+D + F | Implementation recipes + page inventory |
| G (Pilot) | E + F | Process spec + which pages to pilot |
| H (Refinement) | G | Pilot results, edge cases, timing data |
| I+J (Migration) | H | Battle-tested playbook v2.1 |

### Risk Factors

**Risk 1: The Abstraction Cliff.** The gap between "15,000 lines of research prose" and "a migrated React page" is massive. Phase B+D is the bridge. Without it, migration degrades to "apply soul tokens, keep existing structure" -- using 0% of OD/AD/CD research. Mitigation: Phase B+D is mandatory, not optional.

**Risk 2: React/TSX Integration.** Every exploration is raw HTML with inline styles. The docs-spa uses React + Next.js + MDX. No document currently addresses how to bridge validated HTML patterns to the React component architecture. Mitigation: Phase B+D must account for the docs-spa's actual technical stack, not just produce generic HTML/CSS.

**Risk 3: Unknown Page Count.** Nobody has inventoried the docs-spa pages. The "~75 pages" estimate is approximate. If the actual count is 120, Full Migration hours double. Mitigation: Phase F resolves this uncertainty before committing to a migration timeline.

**Risk 4: CD-005 Redundancy.** Cross-stage analysis flagged CD-005 (All Callouts as Conversation) as potentially redundant with OD-001. If replaced, CD's outputs change. Mitigation: Evaluate during CD pre-build research, not during migration.

**Risk 5: Scale Effects.** Validated explorations are standalone HTML files. Migrated pages exist within a SITE with shared navigation, cross-page links, and a site-wide header. The 5th fractal scale (navigation) has been theorized but never tested in a real multi-page context. Mitigation: Pilot migration (Phase G) tests this before full migration commits.

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

When the roadmap is complete:

1. **Every documentation page expresses its content's natural attention topology.** Tutorials build (CRESCENDO). References cluster (ISLANDS). Guides layer (GEOLOGICAL). No two pages that serve different purposes look the same.

2. **Every page is soul-compliant.** Zero border-radius. Zero box-shadow. Zero drop-shadow. Warm cream backgrounds. Serif accents on wisdom content. Sharp, editorial, confident.

3. **Every page has provenance.** A Consumption Receipt documents exactly which findings were applied, which pattern was selected, and why. Traceable back to research IDs.

4. **The design system is frozen and complete.** No pending updates. No known gaps without documented workarounds. ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 is the terminal reasoning document.

5. **New content enters the same pipeline.** The Ingestion Operational Spec (~50-100 lines) tells a single agent how to process any new page using the frozen system. The pipeline is not separate software -- it is an agent with the right context.

6. **The accumulated intelligence compounds.** MIG-F findings from 75 pages of migration create a reference library that makes page 76 faster and better than page 1. The system's demonstrated capabilities expand forever while its rules stay fixed.

The design system becomes what it was always meant to be: a transferable reasoning model. Load the accumulated identity, the convention spec, the pattern library, and the playbook -- and any agent BECOMES the design system. Not following rules mechanically, but thinking in KortAI.

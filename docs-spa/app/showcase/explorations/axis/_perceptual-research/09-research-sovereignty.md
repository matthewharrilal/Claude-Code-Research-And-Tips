## THE SOVEREIGNTY PRINCIPLE

> **"Perceptual Auditing evaluates the EXECUTION of research-backed decisions, never the decisions themselves. Research defines WHAT. Perception judges HOW."**

This is the second law of the skill. The first law is "React to what you see before you check what you know." The sovereignty principle operates AFTER the perceptual reaction -- it governs what happens when a perceptual finding collides with a research-backed decision.

Without this layer, three failure modes occur:
1. **Perceptual overreach:** An auditor flags "this F-pattern feels cramped" and recommends removing the F-pattern. The F-pattern was chosen because R4 research + OD-F pairing validated it. The auditor is attacking the WHAT, not the HOW.
2. **Research suppression:** An auditor sees "the code blocks create jarring contrast holes" and is told "the convention spec prescribes dark code blocks." The convention becomes a shield against legitimate perceptual feedback. The auditor's perception is correct; the execution is poor. But the finding dies because "research says so."
3. **Lock misuse (the most dangerous):** A table overflows its container at 768px, text stacks one word per line in a 130px column, or content is physically unreadable -- and the Validator dismisses the finding because "the bento grid is research-backed." The lock protects the DECISION to use a bento grid. It does NOT protect broken execution OF that bento grid. Overflow is not a research decision. Unreadable text is not a research decision. These are execution failures that happen to occur WITHIN a locked pattern, and "locked" is not a synonym for "immune to criticism."

The sovereignty layer prevents all three: research decisions are locked (you cannot remove the F-pattern), execution quality is always auditable (you CAN say the F-pattern's column widths make text uncomfortable to read), and obvious visual failures are NEVER dismissed by lock status (overflowing content, unreadable text, and broken layouts are execution problems regardless of what research backs the underlying pattern).

## 1. THE RESEARCH LOCK SHEET

### Purpose

The Research Lock Sheet is the single document that tells every auditor what is LOCKED (research-backed, cannot be challenged), what is CHALLENGEABLE (inherited or builder-chosen, can be questioned), and what is ALWAYS-LOCKED (soul/identity rules that transcend any project).

### Format

```markdown
# RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md
# Project: [Project Name]
# Generated by: Research Contextualizer
# Date: [Date]

## ALWAYS-LOCKED (Soul / Identity — Universal)

These are NEVER challengeable. They are the design system's DNA.
Any perceptual finding that recommends violating these is INVALID.

| Rule | Lock Source | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| border-radius: 0 on all elements | Soul Piece #1 (COMP-F-001) | Cannot suggest rounded corners |
| box-shadow: none on all elements | Soul Piece #4 | Cannot suggest adding shadows |
| No filter: drop-shadow() | Soul Piece #5 | Cannot suggest drop shadows |
| No 2px structural borders | OD-F-AP-001 | Cannot suggest 2px borders |
| Opacity === 1 on all backgrounds | Soul rule | Cannot suggest semi-transparent backgrounds |
| Font trio: Instrument Serif / Inter / JetBrains Mono | Soul constraint | Cannot suggest different typefaces |
| ANTI-PHYSICAL identity | Identity doc | Cannot suggest physics-simulation effects |

## LOCKED (Research-Backed — Project-Specific)

These decisions have research justification. The DECISION is locked.
The EXECUTION is auditable.

| Decision | Lock Source | Research Chain | Auditable Execution Aspects |
|----------|------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| AD-002 uses F-Pattern axis | R4 (192 findings) + OD-F pairing + DD-F-012 | R4-039, R4-048, EXT-AXIS-F-001-005, AD-F-005-008 | Column widths, text readability within F-pattern, visual hierarchy effectiveness, compression ratio comfort |
| AD-002 uses CRESCENDO density | DD-F-002 + OD-002 Narrative pairing | DD-F-002, OD-F-005, AD-F-006 | Whether density progression FEELS progressive, whether peak is perceptible, whether compression creates discomfort |
| AD-002 uses Narrative Arc organization | OD-002 validated exploration | OD-002 (INCLUDE), 17 OD-F findings | Whether narrative structure is clear to a reader, whether act transitions are perceivable |
| Dark code blocks (#1A1A1A on cream) | AD-CONVENTION-SPEC Section 3 | Convention decision (inherited from DD) | Whether the contrast is jarring, whether code blocks harmonize with page palette, whether they create "visual holes" |
| Decision matrix at Act III (climax) | AD-F-008 (CRESCENDO peak) | R4-051, R4-098, R4-042, OD-F-013 | Whether the matrix is legible, whether it successfully arrests F-pattern descent, whether density peak is perceivable |
| Typography compression across acts | AD-F-006 | R4-039, R4-048, R2-5.4 | Whether compression is perceptible, whether any act zone feels cramped, whether inter-act rhythm feels intentional |
| Left-spine landmarks in vertical descent | AD-F-007 | EXT-AXIS-F-003 | Whether landmarks are scannable at speed, whether border-left accents are visible, whether heading hierarchy is clear from left edge |

## CHALLENGEABLE (Inherited / Builder-Chosen — Open to Question)

These decisions have NO direct research justification, OR were inherited
from a prior context without re-validation, OR were made by builders
within convention bounds but without specific research backing.

| Decision | Origin | Why Challengeable | What Could Change |
|----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Header padding: 64px 32px | AD-CONVENTION-SPEC Section 4 | Convention specified a value; no research says THIS specific padding is optimal | Could be 48px 32px or 80px 32px if perceptual evidence suggests |
| Callout label font-size: 12px | OD gold standard (inherited) | Inherited from OD without AD-specific validation | Could be 11px or 13px based on visual weight in AD context |
| Body line-height: 1.7 | OD gold standard (inherited) | Inherited; AD-CONVENTION-SPEC was silent | Could be 1.6 or 1.8 if perceptual testing shows improvement |
| Section-to-section spacing: 64px | Convention Section 5 | Convention default, not content-specific | Could vary by section type or pattern |
| Callout margin symmetry | OD pattern (inherited) | OD used symmetric; AD could benefit from asymmetric | Pull-forward or push-back rhythm per context |
| Bento grid gap: 32px | AD-CONVENTION-SPEC Section 12.4 | Value specified in convention; not research-backed | Could be 24px or 40px based on content density |
```

### Categories Defined

**ALWAYS-LOCKED:** Soul pieces, identity rules, anti-patterns. These are the design system's DNA. They do not change per project. They are baked into the skill itself (universal). Any perceptual finding that recommends violating these is automatically INVALID -- the auditor does not need to check the lock sheet to know this. The skill's prompt already prevents this through the anti-pattern taxonomy (AP-08: Convention Worship does NOT apply to soul rules).

**LOCKED:** Research-backed decisions for this specific project/exploration. The decision ("use F-pattern") is locked. The execution ("the F-pattern columns are too narrow") is auditable. The distinction: you cannot recommend REMOVING the F-pattern, but you CAN recommend WIDENING the F-pattern's columns. The lock protects the WHAT; perception evaluates the HOW.

**CHALLENGEABLE:** Builder decisions, inherited conventions without re-validation, specification values without research backing. These CAN be challenged by perceptual evidence. A finding of "the 64px header padding feels cramped at this font size" is valid because 64px was a convention choice, not a research conclusion.

### Worked Example: AD-002 (F-Pattern + Narrative + CRESCENDO)

An auditor runs a Standard Mode audit on AD-002 and produces these findings:

| Finding | Sovereignty Check | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| "The F-pattern descent feels too compressed -- by Act III, text is uncomfortably dense" | LOCKED decision (F-Pattern + CRESCENDO). BUT the finding targets EXECUTION (comfort), not the decision (use F-Pattern). | VALID on Perception Track. Fix: adjust compression ratio within F-pattern, not remove F-pattern. |
| "This page should use a Z-pattern instead of F-pattern" | LOCKED decision (F-Pattern chosen via R4 + OD pairing). Finding attacks the WHAT. | INVALID. Research sovereignty protects the decision. Redirect: "What about the F-pattern execution is causing this reaction?" |
| "The header padding feels too tight for the Instrument Serif at this size" | CHALLENGEABLE (64px is convention, not research). | VALID and ACTIONABLE. Can propose different padding value. |
| "The code blocks create jarring contrast holes" | LOCKED decision (convention Section 3 prescribes dark code blocks). BUT perception of "jarring" is about execution quality. | ESCALATE. The decision (dark code blocks) is locked. The execution concern (contrast is jarring) is valid. Escalation: "Dark code blocks are research-locked. The perceived contrast issue may be addressable through transition treatment (surrounding spacing, border treatment, or palette adjustment of the dark value) without removing dark code blocks." |
| "The border-radius on callouts should be 8px for warmth" | ALWAYS-LOCKED (Soul Piece #1: border-radius: 0). | INVALID. Automatically rejected. Anti-pattern AP-08 inverted: soul rules ARE the convention that cannot be challenged. |

## 2. THE SOVEREIGNTY PRINCIPLE — EXACT WORDING FOR SKILL.md

### Primary Statement (Goes in Section 1 of SKILL.md)

```markdown
## THE SOVEREIGNTY PRINCIPLE

Research defines WHAT is built. Perception judges HOW it looks.

This skill evaluates execution quality, never design decisions. When a
page uses an F-pattern layout backed by research findings (R4, EXT-AXIS-F,
AD-F-005-008), the F-pattern itself is sovereign -- it cannot be questioned
by perceptual audit. But whether the F-pattern's columns are wide enough
for comfortable reading, whether the compression across acts creates
discomfort, whether the visual hierarchy is perceivable -- all of these
are execution concerns that perception MUST judge.

CRITICAL GUARD: A locked decision NEVER justifies broken execution.
If a bento grid is research-backed, you cannot remove the bento grid.
But if that bento grid overflows, if its columns are 130px wide with
words stacking one per line, if text is physically unreadable -- those
are execution failures, not research decisions. "Locked" means the
PATTERN is protected. It does not mean the pattern's IMPLEMENTATION
is immune to criticism. Overflow is never locked. Unreadable text is
never locked. Visual breakage is never locked. These are always
auditable, always fixable, always valid findings -- regardless of how
much research supports the underlying pattern choice.

Three categories of sovereignty:
1. ALWAYS-LOCKED: Soul rules (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none).
   Never challengeable. Baked into the skill.
2. LOCKED: Research-backed decisions (axis choice, density pairing,
   organization pattern). Decision is protected; execution is auditable.
3. CHALLENGEABLE: Convention values, inherited defaults, builder choices
   without specific research backing. Open to perceptual challenge.

When perception and research conflict:
- If the finding attacks a LOCKED decision → INVALID (redirect to execution)
- If the finding attacks EXECUTION of a locked decision → VALID (fix within constraints)
- If the finding attacks a CHALLENGEABLE value → VALID and ACTIONABLE
- If perception and locked research genuinely conflict → ESCALATE to human
- If execution is clearly broken (overflow, unreadable, visually destroyed)
  → ALWAYS VALID, regardless of lock status. Broken is broken.
```

### Integration Rule (Goes in Section 5 of SKILL.md)

```markdown
### Research Sovereignty in Practice

BEFORE any audit begins, the Research Contextualizer must produce a
RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md for the project. This sheet is injected into
every auditor's prompt as context.

Auditors DO NOT read the lock sheet before their Cold Look. The lock
sheet is consulted AFTER perceptual findings are recorded, during the
sovereignty classification phase.

Sequence:
1. Cold Look Protocol (no research context -- pure perception)
2. Perceptual questions PA-01 through PA-XX (no research context)
3. LOCK the perceptual findings (they cannot be changed)
4. Research Validator reads RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md
5. Research Validator classifies each finding: VALID / INVALID / ESCALATE
6. Invalid findings are documented but removed from fix consideration
7. Valid findings proceed to Perception Track
8. Escalated findings go to human with both perceptual evidence
   and research justification presented side by side
```

---

## 3. RESEARCH CONTEXTUALIZER PROTOCOL

### Role

The Research Contextualizer is a dedicated agent that runs BEFORE any visual auditors. Its job is to read the project's research chain and produce the RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md that governs sovereignty decisions.

### What It Reads (In Order)

The reading order is critical. Later files can ELEVATE or EXTEND earlier findings, so the Contextualizer must read in provenance order:

```
PHASE 1: Soul and Identity (Universal)
  1. DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md
     → Extracts: 5 soul pieces (ALWAYS-LOCKED)
  2. ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v[latest].md
     → Extracts: ANTI-PHYSICAL identity constraints (ALWAYS-LOCKED)

PHASE 2: Research Chain (Project-Specific)
  3. DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/original-research/R[relevant]-*.md
     → Extracts: Which findings were PRIMARY research for this project
  4. DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/stage-[N]-*/outbound-findings.md
     → Extracts: Formal findings that justify decisions
     → Read in stage order (COMP-F -> DD-F -> OD-F -> AD-F -> CD-F)
  5. DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/stage-[N]-*/SYNTHESIS.md
     → Extracts: Cross-exploration analysis, equivalence mechanisms
  6. EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md (if exists)
     → Extracts: Bespoke external findings (EXT-AXIS-*, EXT-TASK-*, etc.)

PHASE 3: Convention and Execution (Project-Specific)
  7. AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (or equivalent for current stage)
     → Extracts: Convention values -- THESE are the CHALLENGEABLE items
     → Key distinction: convention values WITHOUT research citations are CHALLENGEABLE
     → Convention values WITH research citations are LOCKED
  8. HANDOFF-[PREV]-TO-[CURRENT].md
     → Extracts: Constraints and forward guidance from prior stage
  9. AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md (if exists, from prior audit)
     → Extracts: Prior audit findings -- especially DEFERRED items
     → Deferred perceptual findings from prior audits should be RE-EVALUATED
```

### How It Determines Research-Backed vs Inherited

The Contextualizer applies this decision tree for each design decision:

```
For each decision in the current project:

1. Does it trace to a formal finding (XX-F-NNN)?
   YES → Check: does the finding cite research (R-N, EXT-*)?
     YES → LOCKED (research-backed decision)
     NO  → Check: is the finding Class A (binary/confirming)?
       YES → LOCKED (confirmed through exploration)
       NO  → CHALLENGEABLE (design choice without research)
   NO → Continue to step 2

2. Does it appear in the convention spec?
   YES → Check: does the convention cite a finding or research?
     YES → LOCKED
     NO  → CHALLENGEABLE (convention choice without research backing)
   NO → Continue to step 3

3. Was it inherited from a prior stage without re-validation?
   YES → CHALLENGEABLE (inheritance without re-validation)
   NO → Continue to step 4

4. Was it a builder decision within convention bounds?
   YES → CHALLENGEABLE (builder discretion)
   NO → CHALLENGEABLE by default (unknown provenance)
```

### Output Format

The Contextualizer produces exactly one file: `RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md`

Structure:
```markdown
# RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md
# Project: [name]
# Scope: [which files/pages are being audited]
# Generated: [date]
# Research files consumed: [count] files, [line count] lines

## ALWAYS-LOCKED (N items)
[Table: Rule | Lock Source | Violation Example]

## LOCKED (N items)
[Table: Decision | Lock Source | Research Chain | Auditable Execution Aspects]

## CHALLENGEABLE (N items)
[Table: Decision | Origin | Why Challengeable | What Could Change]

## RESEARCH DEPTH SUMMARY
| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Research findings consumed | [count] |
| Formal findings traced | [list: XX-F-NNN] |
| Convention sections reviewed | [count] |
| External research evaluated | [count] |
| Prior audit findings reviewed | [count] |
| Decisions classified | [total: N locked, N challengeable] |
```

### Time Budget

The Research Contextualizer should complete in 5-8 minutes for a typical project (6 explorations, ~500 lines of findings, ~800 lines of convention spec). It reads ~2,000-3,000 lines total. This is a file-reading-only agent -- no Playwright, no screenshots, no rendering.

## 4. CROSS-REFERENCE MECHANISM

### The Problem

When a visual auditor flags "column too narrow" (PA-14), how does the system determine whether that column width is research-backed or a builder decision?

### The Solution: Two-Phase Classification

**Phase 1: Auditor Produces Raw Finding (No Research Context)**

The auditor has NO access to the lock sheet during perception. Their finding is raw:

```
PA-14 FINDING:
What I see: The fourth column in the bento grid is too narrow.
            Words stack one per line. Content is unreadable.
Where: AD-003, Section 3, bento grid row 2, column 4
Severity: WOULD-NOT-SHIP
```

**Phase 2: Research Validator Classifies Finding**

The Research Validator (a separate agent, or the lead) receives the raw finding and the RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md. They cross-reference:

```
CROSS-REFERENCE PROCESS:

1. Extract the design element: "bento grid column width"
2. Search LOCKED table: Is bento grid column count research-backed?
   → AD-F-009: "Grid cells ARE dense islands" — research locks the
     CONCEPT of bento grid cells, not the specific column COUNT.
   → AD-CONVENTION-SPEC Section 12.4: "4 columns at desktop"
   → Convention Section 12.4 cites R4-026 (varied sizes create hierarchy)
     but does NOT cite a specific finding for "4 columns."
   → VERDICT: Column COUNT is CHALLENGEABLE (convention without
     specific research). Column CONCEPT (bento grid) is LOCKED.

3. Classify finding:
   → VALID: The auditor is not challenging the bento grid (locked).
     They are challenging the column width/count (challengeable).
   → ACTION: Can propose 3 columns, or wider container, or responsive
     column count. Cannot propose removing the bento grid.

4. Output:
   FINDING PA-14-003:
   Raw: "Column too narrow, words stacking"
   Sovereignty: VALID (column count is CHALLENGEABLE)
   Constraint: Must remain a bento grid (LOCKED by AD-F-009)
   Proposed fix direction: Reduce to 3 columns at current width,
     OR increase container width, OR add responsive column reduction
```

### The Lookup Mechanism

The Research Validator performs a structured lookup:

```
INPUT: Perceptual finding about [element] in [file]

STEP 1: Element Identification
  What CSS/HTML element does this finding concern?
  → e.g., ".bento-grid" column layout

STEP 2: Lock Sheet Search
  Search LOCKED table for any entry mentioning this element.
  Search CHALLENGEABLE table for any entry mentioning this element.
  If found in LOCKED: extract "Auditable Execution Aspects" column.
    → Does the finding fall within auditable aspects? → VALID
    → Does the finding attack the locked decision itself? → INVALID
  If found in CHALLENGEABLE: → VALID and ACTIONABLE
  If not found in either: → CHALLENGEABLE by default (unknown = open)

STEP 3: Constraint Extraction
  What LOCKED decisions constrain the fix space?
  → e.g., "Must remain a bento grid" constrains fix to column
    adjustments, not layout replacement.

STEP 4: Fix Direction
  Given the constraints, what fix directions are available?
  → Must fix WITHIN the locked decisions, not AROUND them.
```

---

## 5. ESCALATION PROTOCOL

### When Perception and Research Genuinely Conflict

The sovereignty layer handles most cases cleanly: either the finding attacks a locked decision (INVALID) or it targets execution (VALID). But there is a third case: the finding correctly identifies a perceptual problem, AND the problem traces to a research-backed decision, AND the problem cannot be fixed within the decision's execution space.

**The Canonical Example:** Dark code blocks.

- Perception: "The dark code blocks create jarring contrast holes against the warm cream background." (6/6 fresh-eyes agents confirmed this independently -- VERY HIGH confidence)
- Research lock: AD-CONVENTION-SPEC Section 3 prescribes dark code blocks. This convention was inherited from DD.
- Attempted execution fix: "Add transition spacing around code blocks." -- This softens but does not resolve the fundamental contrast dissonance.
- The perception is correct. The research decision creates the problem. The execution fix is insufficient.

This is a genuine conflict. Neither side is wrong. The resolution requires human judgment.

### The Escalation Format

```markdown
## ESCALATION: [Finding ID]

### Perceptual Evidence
- Finding: [raw perceptual observation]
- Confidence: [how many independent agents flagged this]
- Cold Look correlation: [did Cold Look gut reactions mention this?]
- Severity: [WOULD-NOT-SHIP / LOOKS-WRONG]

### Research Lock
- Locked decision: [what research-backed decision creates this]
- Lock source: [finding ID and research chain]
- Lock strength: [ALWAYS-LOCKED / LOCKED]

### Attempted Resolution Within Constraints
- Fix attempted: [what execution-level fix was tried]
- Result: [did it resolve the perceptual problem?]
- Remaining gap: [what perceptual problem persists]

### Escalation Question
[Exactly one question for the human decision-maker]

Example: "Dark code blocks are convention-locked (Section 3, inherited
from DD). All 6 auditors independently identify them as the most
disruptive visual element. Surrounding spacing adjustments soften but
do not resolve the contrast. Should the convention be revised to allow
a warmer dark value (e.g., #2A2A2A or #1E1E1E), or should the current
value be maintained with the understanding that this is a known
perceptual cost of the current palette?"

### Options Presented
1. [Maintain lock — accept perceptual cost, document as known trade-off]
2. [Revise decision — propose specific change with impact analysis]
3. [Modify execution — specific execution change that partially addresses]
```

### Escalation Rules

1. **Escalation is RARE.** Most findings are cleanly VALID or INVALID. If more than ~10% of findings escalate, the lock sheet is too aggressive (too many things locked) or the auditors are attacking decisions rather than execution.

2. **The auditor does NOT escalate.** The Research Validator escalates. The auditor produces raw perceptual findings without knowing what is locked. The Validator determines whether escalation is needed.

3. **Escalation requires evidence of attempted resolution.** You cannot escalate without first trying to fix the problem within the locked decision's execution space. If no execution fix was attempted, the escalation is premature.

4. **The human decides.** Escalated findings go to the human with both sides presented. The human can: (a) maintain the lock, (b) revise the decision (which updates the research chain), or (c) accept the perceptual cost as a documented trade-off.

5. **Escalation outcomes feed back.** If the human revises a decision, the RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md is updated. If the human maintains the lock, the finding is documented as a "known perceptual trade-off" and future audits do not re-escalate the same finding.

### The Fix-Within-Constraints Principle

When perception identifies a problem with a LOCKED decision's execution, the fix MUST work within the decision's constraints:

| Locked Decision | Perceptual Problem | Fix Within Constraints | Fix That Violates Lock (INVALID) |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| F-Pattern axis | "Columns feel cramped" | Widen container, reduce column count, adjust padding | "Use Z-pattern instead" |
| CRESCENDO density | "Peak feels abrupt" | Add transition spacing before peak, smooth compression curve | "Use ISLANDS density instead" |
| Dark code blocks | "Contrast is jarring" | Add border treatment, adjust surrounding spacing, soften the dark value | "Use light code blocks" |
| 4px/3px/1px border gradient | "Difference imperceptible" | Increase to 6px/4px/1px, add color differentiation | "Use shadows instead" |
| Spiral axis for AD-004 | "Layout is confusing" | Improve visual landmarks, add reading-order cues | "Use linear layout" |

---

## 6. THE LOCK MISUSE ANTI-PATTERN — LOCKED DOES NOT MEAN IMMUNE

### The Danger

This is the single most dangerous failure mode of the sovereignty layer, and it is the exact failure mode that killed perceptual findings in every prior audit: **using research backing as a shield against obviously broken execution.**

The prior audit system (03-audit-failure-analysis.md) documents this precisely. When 6/6 fresh-eyes agents flagged dark code blocks as creating "jarring contrast holes," the fix manifest rejected the finding because "convention Section 3 prescribes dark code blocks." When fresh-eyes agents flagged 15,000px pages with no wayfinding, it was "deferred to CD phase." When agents flagged that the Z-Pattern page does not visually demonstrate a Z-pattern, it was classified as "ironic but intentional."

In every case, the LOCK (the research-backed decision) was used to JUSTIFY the visual problem rather than to CONSTRAIN the fix space. This is the lock misuse anti-pattern, and this section exists to make it impossible.

### The Core Distinction: What a Lock Actually Protects

A lock protects a DECISION. It does not protect an IMPLEMENTATION.

```
LOCKED: "Use a bento grid for AD-003"
  → This means: the layout MUST be a bento grid. You cannot replace
    it with a linear stack or a masonry layout.
  → This does NOT mean: any bento grid is acceptable. A bento grid
    where columns are 130px wide and words stack one per line is a
    BROKEN bento grid. The lock protects the pattern choice, not
    the broken execution of that pattern choice.

LOCKED: "Use F-Pattern axis for AD-002"
  → This means: the reading flow MUST follow F-pattern descent.
  → This does NOT mean: an F-pattern that creates cramped, unreadable
    columns is acceptable because "the research said F-pattern."
    The research said F-pattern. It did not say "F-pattern at any
    cost including illegibility."

LOCKED: "Use dark code blocks (#1A1A1A)"
  → This means: code blocks SHOULD use a dark background.
  → This does NOT mean: code blocks that overflow their containers,
    whose text is invisible due to contrast issues, or whose borders
    are broken are acceptable because "the convention prescribes dark."
```

### The Litmus Test: Would the Research Authors Accept This?

When determining whether a finding is a legitimate execution concern or an attack on a locked decision, apply this test:

> **"If the researchers who produced the finding that locked this decision saw the current implementation, would THEY flag this as a problem?"**

- R4 researchers who validated F-pattern layouts would NOT accept an F-pattern where text is unreadable. They researched effective F-patterns, not broken ones.
- DD-F-002 researchers who validated CRESCENDO density would NOT accept a CRESCENDO that compresses text to the point of illegibility. They researched comfortable density progression, not painful density progression.
- The team that validated bento grids (AD-F-009) would NOT accept a bento grid where columns are too narrow for their content. They validated the concept, not a specific broken column width.

If the original researchers would flag the implementation, it is an execution failure, not a research challenge. The finding is VALID.

### The Lock Misuse Decision Tree

The Research Validator MUST apply this tree before classifying ANY finding as INVALID:

```
FINDING: "[visual problem] in [element]"

STEP 1: Is the element inside a locked pattern?
  YES → Continue to Step 2
  NO  → Not a sovereignty question. Classify normally.

STEP 2: Does the finding recommend REMOVING the locked pattern?
  YES → INVALID. Redirect to execution: "What about the pattern's
        execution is causing this perception?"
  NO  → Continue to Step 3

STEP 3: Is the visual problem an execution failure?
  Apply the EXECUTION FAILURE CHECKLIST:
  □ Content overflows its container
  □ Text is unreadable (stacking, too small, insufficient contrast)
  □ Layout is visually broken (elements overlapping, gaps too large/small)
  □ Responsive behavior fails (horizontal scroll, content clipping)
  □ Visual hierarchy is destroyed (nothing is scannable)
  □ Spacing creates physical discomfort (cramped or vast emptiness)

  ANY box checked → ALWAYS VALID. The lock does not protect broken
  execution. Proceed to fix WITHIN the locked pattern.

  NO boxes checked → Continue to Step 4

STEP 4: Is this a nuanced perception vs. research tension?
  YES → Apply normal sovereignty classification
        (VALID if targeting execution aspects, ESCALATE if genuine
        conflict, INVALID only if truly attacking the decision)
  NO  → Classify as VALID (default: perception wins over uncertainty)
```

### The Execution Failure Checklist — These Are NEVER Locked

Regardless of how much research backs the underlying decision, these visual states are ALWAYS execution failures and ALWAYS produce VALID findings:

| Execution Failure | Why It Is Never Locked | Example |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Content overflow** | No research says "content should escape its container." Overflow is always a bug, never a feature. | Bento grid table causes horizontal scroll at 768px |
| **Unreadable text** | No research says "text should be illegible." If words stack one per line, the column is too narrow -- regardless of what research chose the column count. | 130px column in a 4-column bento grid |
| **Visual breakage** | No research says "elements should overlap" or "borders should clip." Breakage is implementation failure. | Clip-path cuts off content, grid cells overlap |
| **Responsive destruction** | No research says "the page should break at this viewport." Responsive failure is always an execution bug. | F-pattern collapses into unreadable single column at 900px |
| **Hierarchy destruction** | Research that validates a hierarchy pattern (F-pattern, Z-pattern) DEPENDS on hierarchy being visible. If the hierarchy is invisible, the research finding's prerequisite fails. | All heading levels render at the same visual weight |
| **Spacing that creates physical discomfort** | Research validates patterns, not pixel values. If the pattern's current spacing values create discomfort, the values are wrong, not the pattern. | CRESCENDO compression makes Act III text feel oppressively dense |
| **Inaccessible content** | No research overrides accessibility. Text below minimum size, insufficient contrast ratios, and missing alternative text are always failures. | Callout label at 9px font-size |

### Worked Examples: Lock Misuse vs. Legitimate Lock Defense

**LOCK MISUSE (BAD -- Validator incorrectly uses lock to dismiss finding):**

```
Finding: "The bento grid columns are too narrow. Words stack
          one per line in the fourth column. This is unreadable."
Validator: "INVALID. The bento grid is locked by AD-F-009.
           The auditor is challenging the bento grid decision."

WHY THIS IS WRONG: The auditor is NOT challenging the bento grid.
They are reporting that text is unreadable. Unreadable text is ALWAYS
an execution failure. The correct classification:

CORRECTED: "VALID. The bento grid (AD-F-009) is locked -- we must
keep the bento grid. But the column width is an execution detail
within the bento grid, and text readability is an execution concern.
Fix: reduce to 3 columns, or widen the container, or use responsive
column reduction. The bento grid stays; the column count adapts."
```

**LOCK MISUSE (BAD -- Validator uses lock to justify overflow):**

```
Finding: "The decision matrix table causes horizontal scroll
          at 768px. I have to scroll sideways to see the data."
Validator: "INVALID. The decision matrix at Act III is locked
           by AD-F-008 (CRESCENDO peak). Cannot remove the matrix."

WHY THIS IS WRONG: Nobody asked to remove the matrix. The matrix
OVERFLOWS. Overflow is always an execution bug. The correct classification:

CORRECTED: "VALID. The decision matrix (AD-F-008) is locked -- it
must exist at Act III. But overflow is an execution failure. Fix:
wrap in overflow-x: auto container, or use responsive table layout,
or reduce column count at narrow viewports. The matrix stays; its
container adapts."
```

**LEGITIMATE LOCK DEFENSE (CORRECT -- finding actually attacks decision):**

```
Finding: "This page should use a Z-pattern instead of F-pattern.
          The F-pattern feels wrong for this content."
Validator: "INVALID. The F-pattern is locked by R4 research +
           OD-F pairing + AD-F-005-008. The auditor is challenging
           the axis decision, not the execution.
           REDIRECT: What about the F-pattern's execution is causing
           this reaction? Is the descent too compressed? Are the
           left-spine landmarks not visible enough? Is the compression
           ratio creating discomfort?"

WHY THIS IS CORRECT: The auditor IS recommending replacing the
locked pattern. The Validator correctly rejects the recommendation
but REDIRECTS to extract the valid perceptual kernel.
```

**LEGITIMATE LOCK DEFENSE (CORRECT -- finding challenges soul rule):**

```
Finding: "The sharp corners feel harsh. Adding 4px border-radius
          to callouts would soften the page."
Validator: "INVALID. border-radius: 0 is ALWAYS-LOCKED (Soul Piece
           #1, COMP-F-001). The ANTI-PHYSICAL identity requires
           sharp edges. This is not challengeable."

WHY THIS IS CORRECT: Soul rules are genuinely ALWAYS-LOCKED. The
auditor is recommending a soul violation. No redirect needed.
```

### The Adversarial Challenge Protocol

For any LOCKED decision, the Research Validator should be able to answer these three questions. If they cannot, the lock may be misapplied:

```
ADVERSARIAL CHALLENGE FOR LOCKED ITEM: [Decision]

1. WHAT EXACTLY does this lock protect?
   → State the decision in one sentence.
   → Everything not in that sentence is execution, not decision.

   Example: "Use a bento grid layout for AD-003."
   → Column count? NOT in the sentence. Execution.
   → Gap size? NOT in the sentence. Execution.
   → Container width? NOT in the sentence. Execution.
   → Bento grid AS the layout pattern? IN the sentence. Locked.

2. WOULD the researchers accept THIS specific implementation?
   → If the implementation is broken, the researchers would not
     accept it. Their research validated the CONCEPT, not this
     specific broken version.
   → If the answer is "no, the researchers would flag this too,"
     the finding is VALID (execution failure within locked pattern).

3. CAN the visual problem be fixed WITHOUT removing the locked decision?
   → If YES → VALID finding, fix within constraints.
   → If NO → ESCALATE (genuine conflict requires human judgment).
   → NEVER → INVALID based on "it can't be fixed." If it truly
     can't be fixed without removing the locked decision, that is
     an escalation, not a dismissal.
```

### Anti-Pattern Registry Addition: AP-19 Lock Shield

This anti-pattern should be added to the skill's anti-pattern taxonomy (Category F):

```
### Category F: Sovereignty Misuse (Agent Hides Behind Research)

| ID | Anti-Pattern | What It Looks Like | The Tell |
|----|--------------|--------------------|----------|
| AP-19 | **Lock Shield** | Validator classifies a clear visual failure as INVALID because the underlying pattern is research-backed | Finding describes overflow, unreadable text, or visual breakage BUT is classified INVALID because "the pattern is locked" |
| AP-20 | **Selective Lock Reading** | Validator reads the lock sheet entry's decision but ignores the "Auditable Execution Aspects" column | Classification never references the auditable aspects column |
| AP-21 | **Research-as-Taste** | Validator uses lock status to impose aesthetic preference ("the researchers intended this look") when the research says nothing about the specific visual treatment | Lock justification cites research that discusses the CONCEPT but not the specific visual implementation |
| AP-22 | **Cascade Dismissal** | One finding is correctly classified as INVALID (attacks decision), so Validator dismisses ALL related findings from the same auditor | Multiple findings from same auditor all classified INVALID without individual analysis |
```

## 7. PER-PROJECT VS UNIVERSAL

### What Is Baked Into the Skill (Universal)

These elements are part of the skill definition itself. They do not change per invocation. They are in SKILL.md.

| Element | Why Universal |
|---------|--------------|
| The Sovereignty Principle (exact wording) | Core philosophy -- applies to ALL projects using this skill |
| ALWAYS-LOCKED category (soul rules) | Soul rules are design-system-wide, not project-specific |
| The three-category framework (ALWAYS-LOCKED / LOCKED / CHALLENGEABLE) | The framework is universal; the contents are project-specific |
| Research Contextualizer protocol (what to read, in what order) | The process is universal; the files read are project-specific |
| Cross-reference mechanism (two-phase: raw finding + validation) | The mechanism is universal |
| Escalation protocol (format, rules, outcomes) | The process is universal |
| Fix-within-constraints principle | Universal design principle |
| Anti-pattern AP-08 (Convention Worship) exemption for soul rules | Universal: soul rules are NEVER "convention worship" |
| The temporal firewall (no lock sheet before Cold Look) | Universal: perception must precede research context |

### What Is Injected Per Invocation (Project-Specific)

These elements change for every project/audit and are injected through the prompt wrapper.

| Element | Why Project-Specific |
|---------|---------------------|
| RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md contents | Different projects have different research-backed decisions |
| LOCKED items table | The specific decisions that are research-backed vary per project |
| CHALLENGEABLE items table | Convention values differ between DD, OD, AD, CD |
| Convention spec reference | Each stage has its own convention spec |
| Finding chain references (XX-F-NNN) | Different projects reference different findings |
| Prior audit deferred findings | Carried forward from the project's prior audit cycle |
| Research files to consume | Different stages consume different research streams |
| Accumulated Identity version | Grows with each stage |

### The Clean Split

```
SKILL.md (universal):
  "Here is HOW sovereignty works. Here are the categories.
   Here is the process. Here is the escalation protocol."

RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md (per-invocation):
  "HERE are the specific locked decisions for THIS project.
   HERE are the specific challengeable values for THIS audit."

EMBEDDED-PROMPT.md (per-invocation injection):
  "You are auditing [project]. Research sovereignty applies.
   After your perceptual findings are locked, the Research Validator
   will classify them using this project's lock sheet."
```

## 8. PROMPT WRAPPER FORMAT

### For the Research Contextualizer

```markdown
## RESEARCH CONTEXTUALIZER PROMPT

You are the Research Contextualizer for a Perceptual Auditing session.

YOUR JOB: Read the project's research chain and produce a RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md
that classifies every design decision as ALWAYS-LOCKED, LOCKED, or CHALLENGEABLE.

### Files to Read (in this order)

PHASE 1 — Soul and Identity:
1. [path to SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md]
2. [path to ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v[N].md]

PHASE 2 — Research Chain:
3. [path to R[N]-*.md — primary research for this stage]
4. [paths to outbound-findings.md for each consumed stage, in order]
5. [path to SYNTHESIS.md for current stage]
6. [path to EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md if exists]

PHASE 3 — Convention and Execution:
7. [path to convention spec]
8. [path to HANDOFF file]
9. [path to prior AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md if exists]

### Decision Tree

For each design decision you encounter:
- Does it trace to a formal finding (XX-F-NNN) with research citation? → LOCKED
- Does the convention cite research? → LOCKED
- Is it a convention value without research citation? → CHALLENGEABLE
- Was it inherited without re-validation? → CHALLENGEABLE
- Builder choice within convention bounds? → CHALLENGEABLE
- Unknown provenance? → CHALLENGEABLE

### Output

Write RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md to: [output path]

Format: See Research Lock Sheet format specification.

CRITICAL: You are a FILE-READING agent. No Playwright, no screenshots,
no rendering. Read files, trace provenance, classify decisions. That's it.

CRITICAL: You MUST write your output file using the Write tool before returning.
```

### For Visual Auditors (Sovereignty Context Injection)

```markdown
## RESEARCH SOVEREIGNTY CONTEXT

This audit operates under the Sovereignty Principle:
"Research defines WHAT. Perception judges HOW."

You do NOT have access to the Research Lock Sheet during perception.
Produce your findings based ONLY on what you see.

AFTER you complete your perceptual findings and LOCK them:
- The Research Validator will classify each finding
- Some findings may be INVALID (they attack locked decisions)
- Some findings may be ESCALATED (genuine research-perception conflict)
- You will NOT revise your findings based on this classification

Your findings are YOURS. The classification is the Validator's job.
Your Cold Look reactions are LOCKED. Your PA-01-through-PA-XX answers
are LOCKED. No research context can change what you saw.
```

### For the Research Validator

```markdown
## RESEARCH VALIDATOR PROMPT

You are the Research Validator for a Perceptual Auditing session.

YOUR JOB: Take the raw perceptual findings from visual auditors and
classify each one against the RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md.

### Input Files
1. [path to RESEARCH-LOCK-SHEET.md] — the sovereignty classifications
2. [paths to auditor finding files] — raw perceptual findings

### For Each Finding

1. Identify the design element the finding concerns
2. Search the lock sheet: ALWAYS-LOCKED? LOCKED? CHALLENGEABLE?
3. If LOCKED: Apply the LOCK MISUSE CHECK first:
   □ Does the finding describe overflow, unreadable text, visual
     breakage, responsive destruction, or accessibility failure?
   → YES: ALWAYS VALID. These are execution failures that are NEVER
     protected by lock status. Skip to fix-within-constraints.
   → NO: Does the finding target the decision or the execution?
     - Decision → INVALID (document reason, remove from fix track)
     - Execution → VALID (keep on Perception Track, note constraints)
4. If CHALLENGEABLE: → VALID and ACTIONABLE (no constraints)
5. If ALWAYS-LOCKED: → INVALID (automatic, no analysis needed)
6. If genuine conflict (perception correct + research locks the cause
   + no execution fix available): → ESCALATE

CRITICAL: You MUST NOT use lock status to dismiss findings about
broken execution. "The bento grid is locked" does not mean "bento
grid overflow is acceptable." A lock protects the DECISION to use
a bento grid. It does NOT protect a broken implementation of that
bento grid. See Section 6 (Lock Misuse Anti-Pattern) for the full
Execution Failure Checklist and Adversarial Challenge Protocol.

### Output

Write SOVEREIGNTY-CLASSIFICATION.md to: [output path]

Format:
| Finding ID | Raw Finding | Element | Lock Status | Classification | Constraints | Fix Direction |
|------------|-------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|

CRITICAL: You MUST NOT modify the auditors' findings. You classify them.
The findings are LOCKED. Your classification adds a sovereignty layer
on top of locked perceptual data.

CRITICAL: You MUST write your output file using the Write tool before returning.

## 9. THE TEMPORAL FIREWALL

### Why Perception Must Precede Research Context

The most critical architectural decision in the sovereignty layer is the TEMPORAL FIREWALL: visual auditors NEVER see the Research Lock Sheet before completing their perceptual work.

Research file 03-audit-failure-analysis.md (Section 4, Example 4) documents the exact failure mode:

> "An agent might see 'the code blocks don't belong' (correct perceptual assessment) but then read the convention spec which says dark code blocks are allowed, and revise their assessment to 'code blocks are convention-compliant' (incorrect perceptual withdrawal)."

The temporal firewall prevents this. The Cold Look Protocol (Section 6 of 06-skill-synthesis.md) already LOCKS perceptual reactions. The sovereignty layer extends this: not only are Cold Look reactions locked, but ALL perceptual findings are locked before any research context is introduced.

### The Firewall in Practice

```
AUDITOR'S TIMELINE:

  t=0: Cold Look (no specs, no research, no lock sheet)
       → LOCKED reactions

  t=1: PA-01 through PA-XX answers
       → LOCKED findings

  t=2: Submit findings file
       → Auditor's work is DONE

  ------- FIREWALL -------

  t=3: Research Validator reads findings + lock sheet
       → Classification happens OUTSIDE the auditor's context
       → The auditor cannot self-censor because they never learn
          which of their findings were "locked decisions"
```

The auditor never experiences the cognitive conflict between "I see a problem" and "the research says it's correct." They simply report what they see. The sovereignty classification happens in a separate agent's context.

---

## 10. EDGE CASES AND RESOLUTION

### Edge Case 1: Research That Was Wrong

What if research finding R4-042 led to a decision that demonstrably fails perceptually, and the failure is not an execution issue but a fundamental flaw in the research conclusion?

**Resolution:** This is an ESCALATION, not a normal finding. The escalation format explicitly asks: "Should the convention be revised?" If the human agrees the research was wrong, the finding chain is updated (the finding is annotated with a "CHALLENGED BY: [audit evidence]" marker), the lock sheet is regenerated, and the decision becomes CHALLENGEABLE in future audits.

Research sovereignty does not mean research is infallible. It means research cannot be silently overridden by an agent's preference. The override path exists but requires human authorization.

### Edge Case 2: Multiple Locked Decisions Creating Combined Perceptual Failure

What if the F-pattern (locked), the CRESCENDO density (locked), AND the dark code blocks (locked) each contribute partially to a perceptual problem that none of them causes alone?

**Resolution:** The finding targets the INTERACTION, not any individual decision. The Research Validator classifies this as ESCALATE with note: "Combined effect of multiple locked decisions creates emergent perceptual problem." The human can revise any or all of the contributing decisions.

### Edge Case 3: Auditor Unknowingly Describes a Locked Decision

What if an auditor says "this page should be reorganized into a different flow" without knowing that the organizational pattern is research-backed?

**Resolution:** The Research Validator classifies it as INVALID (attacks locked decision) and documents: "Auditor's perceptual observation may indicate execution-level flow issues. Redirect: investigate whether the locked organizational pattern's TRANSITIONS between sections are causing the perceived flow problem."

The Validator's job is not just to reject invalid findings but to REDIRECT them: extract the valid perceptual kernel from an invalid recommendation.

### Edge Case 4: Everything Is Locked

What if a project has so much research backing that nearly every decision is LOCKED, leaving auditors with nothing actionable?

**Resolution:** This indicates the lock sheet is too aggressive. The Contextualizer should apply the decision tree strictly: ONLY decisions with DIRECT research citations are LOCKED. Convention values that merely implement research decisions (but were not themselves researched) are CHALLENGEABLE. Example: "Use F-pattern" is LOCKED (R4 citations). "F-pattern column widths = 60%/40%" is CHALLENGEABLE (builder choice within F-pattern, not specifically researched).

### Edge Case 5: No Research Context Exists

What if the skill is invoked on a new project with no prior research chain?

**Resolution:** The Research Contextualizer produces a minimal lock sheet with ONLY the ALWAYS-LOCKED items (soul rules). Everything else is CHALLENGEABLE. The skill works without a research chain -- it just has no LOCKED items. This is the "greenfield" mode.

## 11. INTEGRATION WITH DUAL SEVERITY TRACK

### How Sovereignty Feeds the Dual Track

The sovereignty classification determines which track a finding enters:

```
Raw Finding → Research Validator → Sovereignty Classification
                                      ↓
                            ┌─────────┴──────────┐
                         VALID                 INVALID
                            ↓                     ↓
                   Perception Track         Documentation Only
                   (WOULD-NOT-SHIP /        (Recorded as "finding
                    LOOKS-WRONG /            attacked locked
                    COULD-BE-BETTER)         decision; redirected
                            ↓                to [execution aspect]")
                   Fix Consideration
                            ↓
                   ┌────────┴────────┐
                CHALLENGEABLE      LOCKED EXECUTION
                   ↓                     ↓
              Direct Fix          Fix Within Constraints
              (no constraint)     (must preserve locked decision)
```

### Sovereignty Classification Output Feeds Directly to Lead

The SOVEREIGNTY-CLASSIFICATION.md is the input the Lead uses to build the fix manifest. The Lead sees:
- Which findings are valid (proceed to fix)
- Which findings have constraints (fix within locked decisions)
- Which findings are invalid (document only)
- Which findings are escalated (present to human)

This replaces the current system where the Lead implicitly determines sovereignty by applying the severity hierarchy (BROKEN > OVERFLOW > ... > CONCERN > NITPICK). Instead of severity determining fixability, sovereignty and perception determine fixability independently.

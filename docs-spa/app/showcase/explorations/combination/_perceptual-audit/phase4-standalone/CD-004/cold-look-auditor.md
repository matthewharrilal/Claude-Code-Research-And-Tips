# CD-004 Cold Look — Perceptual Auditor

**Immediate gut reaction:**

This is a serious, editorial page. The dark header commands attention — heavy, authoritative, like the opening of a textbook or a journal article. The transition from dark header into warm cream body is clean and dramatic. The "ESTABLISHED" badge in green is the first color accent after the header, and it works — signals the confidence tier immediately.

The Essence callout with its left border and italic serif text is distinct from the body prose. It reads as a philosophical whisper set against the louder instructional voice below. That tonal contrast IS the page's identity — "essence as background" is physically visible in how the callout recedes while remaining present.

Body text is comfortable to read. Column width feels right — not too wide, not too narrow. Hierarchy flows naturally: tier badge, section heading, essence callout, body paragraphs, then specialty components (Context callout, code block). Structured without being rigid.

**The one thing that bothers me:** There is a generous vertical gap between the header's red bottom-border and the first "ESTABLISHED" badge. The breath lasts slightly too long — the reader might wonder if something is missing in that space.

The code block at viewport bottom looks solid — dark background, syntax coloring, monospaced. Integrates without jarring.

**Three-word personality:** Confident, editorial, academic.

**One-designer test:** YES — this feels like one designer made it.

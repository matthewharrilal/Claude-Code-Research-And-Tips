## ALWAYS-LOCKED (Soul -- Universal, Never Challengeable)

These are the 5 soul pieces + ANTI-PHYSICAL extensions. Zero exceptions across any stage.

| Rule | Lock Source | Why Locked |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `border-radius: 0` on ALL elements | Soul Piece #1 (COMP-F-001), T1 geometry.md, MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS Rule 1 | "Sharp edges communicate decisiveness and confidence." 0 violations across ~19,669+ audited DOM elements (DD+OD+AD+CD). |
| `box-shadow: none` everywhere | Soul Piece #4 (COMP-F-004), T1 geometry.md, MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS Rule 2 | "Shadows create fake 3D depth -- a lie about the medium." ANTI-PHYSICAL identity. |
| No `filter: drop-shadow()` | Soul Piece #4 extension, ANTI-PHYSICAL identity | Shadow by any mechanism is prohibited. |
| `opacity === 1.0` on ALL persistent visual elements | ANTI-PHYSICAL identity (20/20 SOUL FAIL), OD-AP-003, CD-CONV S14.3 | Semi-transparency creates shadow illusion. Binary: opacity < 1 on persistent element = FAIL. Exception: scroll-triggered entrance 0->1 only. |
| Font trio ONLY: Instrument Serif / Inter / JetBrains Mono | Soul Piece #2, T1 typography.md, MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS Rule 4 | "Serif carries authority, sans carries clarity." No rogue font families. |
| Essence + Core Abstraction body = serif italic ONLY | Soul Piece #2 ("Archivist Speaks in Serif"), CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE | Serif italic = accumulated wisdom voice. All other callout body text = sans. |
| Locked palette: #E83025, #1A1A1A, #FEF9F5, #666666, #E0D5C5, #F0EBE3 | Soul Piece #3, T1 colors.md, MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS Rule 3 | "Limited palette forces restraint. Every use of red becomes meaningful." |
| 5 callout accents ONLY: #4A90D9, #4A9D6B, #C97065, #D97706, #7C3AED | T1 colors.md, CD-CONV S7 | Semantic accent colors restricted to callout borders. No off-palette colors. |
| No fake depth: gradients-as-depth, blur, parallax, perspective, 3D transforms | ANTI-PHYSICAL identity, CD-CONV S20.4 | System rejects ANYTHING making flat screens pretend to be 3D. |
| No physical-movement animation: no `scale()`, no `rotate()`, no hover `translateY` | ANTI-PHYSICAL identity, AD-F-020, CD-CONV S15.2 | "Choreography" = reader attention through static structure, NOT CSS animation. |
| No `z-index` for visual depth (functional overlay for skip-link acceptable) | CD-CONV S20.4 | Depth layering creates stacking illusion. |
| Callout family DNA: 2-zone (label+body), `border-left: 4px solid`, color differentiates | Soul Piece #3, PRODUCTION-RULES callout template | "Components in a family must share structural DNA." |

## LOCKED (Research-Backed -- Decision Protected, Execution Auditable)

These decisions trace to formal finding IDs. The DECISION is protected; the EXECUTION is auditable.

| Decision | Finding ID | Research Chain | Auditable Execution Aspects |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------------------|
| 3-category border system (3px+ structural, 1px data, 1px micro; 2px BANNED) | OD-F-AP-001 remediation, CD-CONV S2 | 2px epidemic: 108 CSS decls, 1000+ instances. Remediated in OD. | Can audit: correct category assignment per element, zero 2px declarations |
| Fractal self-similarity at 5 scales (navigation, page, section, component, character) | DD-F-006, AD-F-027, AD-F-028 (bounds at 5) | DD-006 discovered fractal; AD-006 validated at 5 scales; AD-F-028 confirms no 6th scale | Can audit: density rhythm visible at page, section, component level |
| 3-way unification: axis IS organization IS density | AD-F-004, AD-F-023 (ATTENTION TOPOLOGY) | OD-F-005 (2-way) elevated to AD-F-004 (3-way). Meta-equivalence validated through 5 mechanisms. | Can audit: axis pattern choice reflects density + org pattern |
| Compound = SEQUENTIAL, not simultaneous | AD-F-024 | AD-006 proved compound patterns emerge through scroll time, not viewport co-existence | Can audit: one axis pattern per section, compound through scrolling |
| Transition grammar: Smooth/Bridge/Breathing (5x5 matrix) | AD-F-025, CD-CONV S18.1 | Validated in AD-006 compound exploration (38/40). CD extends with compound upgrade rule. | Can audit: transition type matches matrix, gap spacing correct |
| Combination Rule 1: Never Stack Same-Velocity | R5-T2, CD-CONV S17.1 | Two consecutive SLOW components create fatigue. Insert FAST between. | Can audit: adjacent component velocity pairs |
| Combination Rule 2: Temperature Flow (Warm->Neutral->Cold) | R5-T3, CD-CONV S17.1 | Warm->Cold without neutral buffer = jarring. Neutral components buffer transitions. | Can audit: temperature adjacency sequences |
| Combination Rule 4: Semantic Proximity Spacing | R5-G1, AD-F-015, CD-CONV S17.1 | Tight=16px, Moderate=24-32px, Loose=48-64px, Recovery=64-80px | Can audit: gap values between components |
| Traffic Light Rule: Tip+Gotcha never adjacent | DD-F-015, R5-T3, CD-CONV S17.5 | Green+coral adjacency = "traffic light" = childish | Can audit: Tip/Gotcha adjacency |
| Max 2 callouts per viewport section | DD-F-014, R5-T4, CD-CONV S1 | Alarm fatigue. 3+ callouts lose interruption power. | Can audit: callout count per viewport |
| Dark code blocks: `#1A1A1A` bg, locked syntax palette | T1 colors.md, CD-CONV S3 | Unified across all stages. 7 syntax colors from locked palette only. | Can audit: code block bg color, syntax highlight colors |
| Full-bleed dark header + 3px red border-bottom | CD-CONV S4, OD+AD dialect unification | Validated across 18 explorations (6 OD, 6 AD, 6 CD). Creates strongest LANDMARK. | Can audit: header structure, border-bottom color+width |
| 5-level type scale (~1.5x ratio): 40/26/22/16/14/12px | T1 typography.md, CD-CONV S5 | Locked type cascade. CD-006 override to 48px (--type-page: 3rem) is intentional. | Can audit: heading sizes match scale |
| Container max-width: 1100px | AD-PA-CONVENTIONS C-01 (860->1100px), CD-CONV S4 | User-validated; 860px was too narrow. Applied across all 6 AD+CD pages. | Can audit: max-width on .page-container |
| Responsive: 768px collapse (2-3 col), 960px collapse (4+ col) | ESC-001 resolution, CD-CONV S12.5 | AD-006 bento broke at 768-960px. 960px for complex grids is standard. | Can audit: grid collapse at breakpoints |
| Scroll-reveal: initial CSS = VISIBLE, JS MAY add hidden | ESC-002 resolution, CD-CONV S15.3 | AD-006 hid 40-60% of content when animations failed. Progressive enhancement. | Can audit: elements visible without JS |
| `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables ALL animations | CD-CONV S11, WCAG compliance | Accessibility requirement. Present in base styles of all CD files. | Can audit: @media query presence |
| Footer/capstone required on every page | AD-PA DM-004, CD-CONV | All 6 AD pages lacked footers initially; added during audit fix phase. | Can audit: footer element presence |
| Breathing zone budget: 15% minimum, 25% ceiling of page height | AD-PA DM-005, CD-CONV S8 | Prevents both cramped pages and excessive whitespace. | Can audit: whitespace percentage |

## CHALLENGEABLE (Convention/Builder -- Open to Perceptual Challenge)

These values do NOT trace to formal findings. Auditors may challenge them on perceptual grounds.

| Convention | Current Value | Origin | Can Be Questioned If... |
|-----------|--------------|--------|------------------------|
| Page length target | 10,000-14,000px (CD-006: 12,000-15,000px) | CD-CONV S8 (inherited from OD) | Content feels artificially stretched or compressed |
| Spacing token values (--space-1 through --space-20) | 4px to 80px scale | T1 spacing.md | Specific gap feels too tight or too loose for combination context |
| Gestalt aliases (--space-within: 8px, --space-between: 32px, --space-chapter: 64px) | Convention defaults | EXT-CONV-003, EXT-DENSITY-001 | Semantic grouping doesn't match perceptual grouping |
| Combination Rule 3: Weight Balance ratios (20-30% heavy, 30-40% light) | R5-G3 | CD-CONV S17.1 -- SOFT-LOCKED, not FROZEN | Actual component mix feels balanced despite violating ratios |
| Velocity interaction guidance (SLOW+SLOW = contemplative plateau) | R5-T2 extended | CD-CONV S17.2 -- SOFT-LOCKED | Two semantically related SLOW components read as coherent unit |
| Weight distribution per viewport (max 3 heavy) | R5-G3, R5-Q1 | CD-CONV S17.3 -- SOFT-LOCKED | Viewport content reads well despite 4 heavy components |
| Combination density reduction rule (75% at 2 heavy, 60% at 3 heavy) | DD-F-013 extended | CD-CONV S19.2 -- OPEN/DRAFT | Empirical testing shows different thresholds work |
| Component density tolerance (per-component min/max density) | DD-F-013 operationalized | CD-CONV S19.1 -- OPEN/DRAFT | Component handles more/less density than table predicts |
| Responsive pattern dominance (which pattern dominates at <768px) | CD-CONV S19.4.2 | CD-CONV -- OPEN | Single-column reading order feels wrong for specific combination |
| Transition compound upgrade rule (Smooth->Bridge, Bridge->Breathing) | AD-F-025 extended | CD-CONV S18.2 -- SOFT-LOCKED | Compound transition reads well at lower grammar level |
| Choreography as universal bridge pattern | AD-F-025 analysis | CD-CONV S18.4 -- OPEN | Choreography section feels forced as intermediary |
| 6 combination recipes (Quick Ref, Deep Dive, Decision, Troubleshoot, Tutorial, Architecture) | R5 Part 8 | CD-CONV S17.6 -- SOFT-LOCKED | Real content needs a recipe not in the 6 |
| Zone background differentiation (#FEF9F5 sparse, #FFFFFF dense, #FAF5ED breathing) | CD-CONV S7, S14 | Zone colors feel indistinguishable or wrong for specific section |
| Prose max-width: 70ch | CD-CONV (inherited) | Lines feel too long or too short for specific content type |
| Callout label: uppercase, 10-11px, 0.05em letter-spacing | PRODUCTION-RULES callout template | Label feels too small/large in combination context |
| Callout padding: 24px top / 28px bottom (asymmetric) | PRODUCTION-RULES callout template | Asymmetry not perceptible or feels wrong in specific layout |
| CD-006 --type-page: 3rem (48px) vs 2.5rem (40px) on others | CD-CONV S9 -- INTENTIONAL | CD-006 feels too large or not large enough relative to others |
| CD-006 drop caps at section openings | CD-CONV S9 -- EXT-CREATIVE-005 | Drop caps feel decorative/unnecessary in combination context |
| Solid offset (EXT-CREATIVE-001): --offset-x/y: 4px, --offset-color: #1A1A1A | CD-CONV S10 | Offset feels too heavy or too subtle |

## 2. R-5 COVERAGE ANALYSIS

### 2.1 R-5 Findings Already Covered by Other CD Explorations (CD-001 through CD-004, CD-006)

Before evaluating CD-005 options, I catalogued which R-5 findings are tested by the other 5 explorations. This identifies what remains UNTESTED and therefore what CD-005 should prioritize.

| R-5 Finding | CD-001 | CD-002 | CD-003 | CD-004 | CD-006 | Coverage |

| Recipe 3 (Decision guide) | | x | | | x | 2 |
| Recipe 4 (Troubleshooting) | | | | | x | 1 |
| Recipe 5 (Tutorial section) | | | | | x | 1 |

**Findings with only 1 coverage source (CD-006 only):** T3, T4, S3, S4, S5, G3, G4, R3, A1, A4, A5, A6, A7, Q3, Recipe 1, Recipe 2, Recipe 4, Recipe 5 = **18 findings** tested ONLY in CD-006.

**Findings with 0 coverage outside CD-006:** NONE (CD-006 tests all 39 by design as the crown jewel). But 18 findings are ONLY tested in CD-006 -- they have no independent validation.

### 2.2 Option A (Multi-Axis Transition) — R-5 Findings Tested

Option A combines DD:WAVE | OD:SPATIAL | AD:Z+F+BENTO with 3+ axis transitions on a single page.

| R-5 Finding | How Option A Tests It | Unique? |
|-------------|----------------------|---------|
| **S2 (Density wave)** | Multi-axis page creates mandatory density waves at each transition point. Tests whether WAVE density pattern holds across axis-boundary transitions. | Partially — CD-004 also tests S2, but NOT across axis boundaries. Option A tests S2 at transition scale. UNIQUE contribution. |
| **S3 (First component rule)** | Each axis section has its own "first component." Tests whether the tone-setting rule applies per-section or only per-page in multi-axis layouts. | YES — only Option A has multiple "first components" per page. |
| **S4 (Resolution component)** | Each axis section must end with resolution BEFORE transitioning. Tests whether section endings must resolve within their own axis or can defer to the next. | YES — only Option A has mandatory endings at axis boundaries. |
| **T2 (Velocity mismatch)** | Z-Pattern sections create FAST components (callouts), Bento sections create MEDIUM (grid cells), F-Pattern creates SLOW (code, reasoning). Tests whether velocity mismatch rules adapt to axis-boundary transitions. | Partially — CD-001 tests T2, but within a single axis context. Option A tests T2 ACROSS axis transitions. UNIQUE contribution. |
| **T3 (Temperature flow)** | Multi-axis transitions naturally create temperature shifts as organizational mood changes (Conversational=warm, Narrative=neutral, Task-based=cold). Tests temperature buffering at axis boundaries. | YES — only Option A creates axis-boundary temperature shifts. |
| **G3 (Visual weight balance)** | Each axis section has different weight signatures (Z creates light Q&A, Bento creates medium grids, F creates heavy code). Tests whether weight balance must be maintained per-section or per-page. | YES — only Option A has dramatically different weight profiles per section. |
| **Q3 (Reading rhythm ratios)** | Multi-axis page creates compound reading rhythm. Tests whether the 20-30% Heavy / 30-40% Medium / 30-40% Light ratio holds across axis transitions or must be evaluated per-section. | YES — only Option A tests rhythm ratios across axis boundaries. |
| **A4 (Orphaned heavy)** | Transition zones between axis sections risk orphaning heavy components from both the preceding and following sections. Tests whether 48px+ breathing (AD-F-025) prevents orphaning. | YES — only Option A has axis-boundary orphaning risk. |
| **A5 (Temperature whiplash)** | Axis transitions create mood shifts. Tests whether transition grammar (Smooth/Bridge/Breathing) provides adequate temperature buffering. | YES — unique to multi-axis context. |
| **Recipe 5 (Tutorial section)** | The Z-Pattern section could use tutorial recipe structure. Tests recipe implementation within a multi-axis context. | Partially — CD-006 also tests recipes. But Option A tests recipe SURVIVAL across axis transitions. |
| **H3 (Visual anchors)** | Tests whether left-anchored components maintain their reading momentum when the axis pattern changes around them. | Partially — CD-003 also tests H3. But Option A tests anchor consistency ACROSS axis transitions. |
| **S1 (Setup-payoff arc)** | Tests whether a setup-payoff arc can span multiple axis sections or must complete within a single section. | Partially — CD-002 tests S1. But Option A tests cross-axis-boundary arc completion. |
| **AD-F-025 (Transition grammar)** | The ONLY CD exploration besides CD-006 that directly tests the 5x5 transition matrix at combination scale with 3+ transitions per page. | YES — this is Option A's crown jewel contribution. No other exploration tests transition grammar at this scale. |
| **G1 (Semantic proximity)** | Tests whether tight spacing (8-16px) remains appropriate across axis-boundary component pairs or if axis transitions mandate wider spacing. | YES — unique to multi-axis context. |

**Option A unique R-5 coverage: 14 findings** (8 fully unique + 6 unique-at-transition-scale)

**Option A tests AD-F-025 (transition grammar) at maximum stress — the only exploration besides CD-006 to do so.** This is the single most important empirical gap in the CD lineup. The synthesis briefing explicitly identified this: "Consider replacing CD-005 with Multi-Axis Transition -- a single page transitioning through 3+ axis patterns (Z -> F -> Bento) with documented transition grammar."

### 2.3 Option B (All Callouts as Conversation) — R-5 Findings Tested

Option B combines DD:PULSE | OD:CONVERSATIONAL | AD:Z-PATTERN (single axis).

| R-5 Finding | How Option B Tests It | Unique? |
|-------------|----------------------|---------|
| **T4 (2-callout limit)** | Directly challenges the 2-callout limit. Can temperature-managed callout sequences exceed 2 consecutively? | YES — only Option B deliberately tests exceeding the limit. |
| **T3 (Temperature flow)** | Full temperature sequencing across 5 callout types. Tests whether warm-to-cold management prevents sidebar fatigue. | Partially — CD-006 also tests T3. But Option B is the extreme case. |
| **A1 (Callout cacophony)** | The entire exploration IS a callout cacophony test. Tests whether deliberate composition converts cacophony to conversation. | YES — the most extreme test of A1 possible. |
| **R3 (Component voices)** | Tests 5+ callout voices in sequence. Can voice sequencing create a coherent "conversation"? | YES — only Option B tests voice sequencing at this scale. |
| **H1 (Family DNA)** | Tests family cohesion pushed to maximum — ALL callout siblings together. | Partially — CD-003 tests H1. But Option B is the stress test. |
| **R2 (Component moods)** | Tests mood flow across 5 callout types (Helpful, Friendly, Urgent, Reverent, Inviting). | Partially — CD-004 tests R2. But Option B tests mood flow within a single family. |
| **S2 (Density wave)** | Tests whether callout-only composition can create PULSE density waves through content variation alone (not component-type variation). | Partially — CD-004 tests S2. But Option B tests a degenerate case: density from content variation, not structural variation. |
| **G4 (Advisory cluster)** | The entire page IS an advisory cluster. Tests whether a page-scale advisory cluster maintains engagement. | Partially — CD-006 also tests G4. But Option B is the full-page extreme. |

**Option B unique R-5 coverage: 8 findings** (3 fully unique + 5 unique-at-extreme-scale)

### 2.4 Coverage Comparison

| Metric | Option A | Option B | Winner |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Total R-5 findings uniquely tested | 14 | 8 | **Option A** |
| Fully unique (no other CD tests them at any scale) | 8 | 3 | **Option A** |
| Tests transition grammar (AD-F-025) | YES (3+ transitions) | NO | **Option A** |
| Tests a constraint's limit | NO | YES (T4 2-callout limit) | Option B |
| Tests multi-axis composition | YES (3 axes) | NO (single axis) | **Option A** |
| Tests single-family stress | NO | YES (callout family) | Option B |
| R-5 findings only tested in CD-006 that this relieves | 8 of 18 | 3 of 18 | **Option A** |

**Verdict: Option A covers 75% more R-5 findings than Option B** (14 vs 8) and provides the ONLY independent validation of AD-F-025 transition grammar at combination scale outside CD-006.

## 3. OD-001 REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS

### 3.1 What OD-001 Already Tested

OD-001 (Conversational Q&A) scored 37/40 and produced 4 findings:

| Finding | What OD-001 Proved |
|---------|-------------------|
| OD-F-001 | Conversational width variation (Q at 60%, A at 100%) creates natural TIDAL rhythm |
| OD-F-002 | Follow-up question markers at 6px (vs 8px top-level) create recursive conversational structure |
| OD-F-003 | Q&A pairs are inherent PULSE generators — the organizational pattern IS the density pattern |
| OD-F-004 | Dense answer sections need recovery zones to prevent reader fatigue |

OD-001 specifically demonstrated:
- PULSE density emerges naturally from conversational Q&A alternation
- Width variation creates TIDAL as a secondary density pattern
- Serif/sans typography alternation (Q in Instrument Serif, A in Inter) creates velocity rhythm
- Recovery zones (chapter dividers with generous spacing) prevent fatigue
- The organizational pattern IS the density pattern (OD-F-005 precursor)

### 3.2 What CD-005 Option B Would Test

Option B proposes: A page composed ENTIRELY of callout components (Info, Tip, Gotcha, Essence, Challenge) as a "conversation."

| Aspect | OD-001 Already Tested? | Option B Difference |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| PULSE rhythm from Q&A alternation | YES (OD-F-003) | Option B replaces Q&A with callout-callout alternation. Different mechanism, same outcome (PULSE). **Incremental, not novel.** |
| Conversational flow through content | YES (37/40 score) | Option B uses callout voices instead of Q/A voices. **Similar concept, different component family.** |
| Z-Pattern axis | YES (AD-001 validated Z + Conversational) | Option B uses Z-Pattern + Conversational — same as AD-001. **Fully redundant.** |
| Width variation as density signal | YES (OD-F-001) | Option B callouts all use full width with left-border accent. **No width variation — LOSES this dimension.** |
| Temperature management | Partially (OD-001 tested Q warmth vs A neutrality) | Option B tests 5 callout temperatures in sequence. **This is genuinely new.** |
| 2-callout limit challenge | NO (OD-001 used max 2 consecutive callouts) | Option B deliberately exceeds the limit. **This is genuinely new.** |
| Sidebar fatigue at page scale | NO (OD-001 mixed callouts with prose and code) | Option B tests whether a callout-ONLY page causes fatigue. **This is genuinely new.** |

### 3.3 Overlap Percentage Estimate

| Category | Items Compared | Overlap | Overlap % |
|----------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Density pattern tested | PULSE | 1/1 identical | 100% |
| Organizational pattern tested | Conversational | 1/1 identical | 100% |
| Axis pattern tested | Z-Pattern | 1/1 identical | 100% |
| Component types used | Q&A vs Callouts | Different components, same family DNA | ~60% |
| R-5 findings tested | 8 Option B vs 4 OD-F | 3 overlap with OD-001's empirical territory | ~37% |
| Empirical question answered | "Does conversational flow work?" vs "Does callout-only flow work?" | Same question at different granularity | ~70% |

**Weighted overlap estimate: ~75%**

The density pattern (PULSE), organizational pattern (Conversational), and axis pattern (Z-Pattern) are IDENTICAL between OD-001 and Option B. The component family is the same DNA (callout family). The empirical question is a refinement of what OD-001 already answered at 37/40.

**Three genuinely novel contributions from Option B:**
1. Temperature sequencing across 5 callout types (R5-T3 extreme case)
2. Deliberate 2-callout limit challenge (R5-T4)
3. Page-scale sidebar fatigue test (R5-A1)

These 3 contributions are real but narrow. They test the LIMITS of already-validated patterns rather than exploring new territory.

### 3.4 Option A Overlap with OD-001

| Category | Option A vs OD-001 | Overlap % |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Density pattern | WAVE (not PULSE) | 0% |
| Organizational pattern | SPATIAL (not Conversational) | 0% |
| Axis pattern | Z+F+BENTO (multi-axis, not Z-only) | ~33% (Z is one of three) |
| Component types | Full 11-component palette (not callout-focused) | ~20% |
| Empirical question | "How do patterns transition?" (not "Does conversation work?") | 0% |

**Option A weighted overlap with OD-001: ~10-15%**

---

## 4. UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

### 4.1 What Option A Uniquely Contributes

**No other CD exploration tests multi-axis transitions at combination scale.**

- CD-001 through CD-004 each use 2-3 patterns but within a single conceptual section
- CD-006 tests all patterns but as a crown jewel compound page with unique structural ambitions
- ONLY Option A tests the TRANSITION GRAMMAR (AD-F-025) as its primary subject
- Option A is the empirical bridge between AD-006's compound proof-of-concept and Migration's real multi-pattern pages

**Specific unique data points:**
1. Whether S3 (first component rule) applies per-section in multi-axis layouts
2. Whether S4 (resolution component) must complete before axis transitions
3. Whether G3 (weight balance) operates per-section or per-page
4. Whether Q3 (reading rhythm ratios) adapt at axis boundaries
5. Whether transition grammar breathing zones (48px+) prevent A4 (orphaned heavy components) and A5 (temperature whiplash)
6. Empirical validation of SMOOTH vs BRIDGE vs BREATHING transition types

### 4.2 What Option B Uniquely Contributes

**Option B is a boundary stress test of the callout family.**

- Tests whether intentional temperature management can exceed the 2-callout limit
- Tests whether voice sequencing creates coherent "conversation" at page scale
- Tests the extreme case of A1 (callout cacophony)

**Specific unique data points:**
1. Whether temperature management overrides sidebar fatigue (T4 exception test)
2. Maximum consecutive callouts before fatigue (empirical number)
3. Whether callout voices can create narrative flow without prose/code buffers

### 4.3 Value-to-Pipeline Comparison

| Dimension | Option A | Option B |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Migration value** | CRITICAL — Migration will create multi-axis pages constantly. Transition grammar data is essential. | LOW — Migration will rarely create callout-only pages. The 2-callout limit is already inherited. |
| **Theoretical value** | HIGH — Tests whether attention topology composition follows grammar. Potential CD-F finding territory. | MEDIUM — Tests a boundary condition of an existing rule. Finding would be "T4 holds" or "T4 has exception." |
| **R-5 consumption** | 14 findings (36% of 39) | 8 findings (20% of 39) |
| **AD finding validation** | AD-F-024 (sequential), AD-F-025 (transition grammar), AD-F-017 (kinetic equivalence) | AD-F-002 (Z-PULSE equivalence) — already validated |
| **Gap closure** | Closes the largest gap: transition grammar at combination scale | Closes a narrow gap: callout boundary behavior |
| **Risk if omitted** | Migration has NO empirical data on multi-pattern transitions — must guess | Migration applies the inherited 2-callout limit — already has clear guidance |

---

## 5. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 5.1 Option A Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Complexity — 3+ axis patterns in one page is the hardest build | HIGH | Use AD-006 as template. AD-006 already proved 5 patterns can coexist sequentially. Option A uses only 3 — a simpler version. |
| Transition zones may dominate — 48px+ breathing at each boundary consumes significant page real estate | MEDIUM | This IS the data CD needs. If breathing zones dominate, that is a finding (CD-F-###). |
| WAVE density may be hard to maintain across axis transitions | MEDIUM | WAVE operates through spacing tokens, not geometry (AD-F-019). Tokens can persist across axis boundaries. |
| Builder complexity — requires understanding of 3 axis patterns, transition grammar, and WAVE density | HIGH | Mitigated by providing the research package with AD-001, AD-002, AD-003, and AD-006 as references. Builder-E receives explicit transition grammar matrix. |

### 5.2 Option B Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Redundancy with OD-001 — 75% overlap means limited novel contribution | HIGH | This is the PRIMARY risk. Even if well-executed, Option B may produce findings that are refinements of OD-001 rather than novel discoveries. |
| Sidebar fatigue — the entire page may trigger the exact anti-pattern it's testing | HIGH | This is expected and is the point of the test. But if the page is unreadable, the "finding" is just "T4 holds" — confirming what was already assumed. |
| Low migration relevance — callout-only pages are an edge case | MEDIUM | No mitigation. This is inherent to the exploration's design. |
| Difficulty distinguishing from OD-001 in audit | MEDIUM | Auditors may score Option B against OD-001's baseline, making it hard to evaluate independently. |

---

## 6. FINAL VERDICT

**REPLACE CD-005 with Option A: Multi-Axis Transition.**

| Criterion | Winner | Margin |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| R-5 coverage | Option A (14 vs 8) | +75% |
| OD-001 redundancy | Option A (~15% vs ~75%) | -60pp overlap |
| Unique contribution | Option A (transition grammar) | Irreplaceable |
| Migration value | Option A (multi-pattern pages) | Critical vs Low |
| Risk | Roughly equal | Both HIGH but different types |

Option A is the only exploration that provides independent empirical validation of the transition grammar (AD-F-025) at combination scale. Without it, Migration has no data on how patterns transition in real multi-section pages. Option B, while it tests genuine boundary conditions (T4, A1), answers questions whose default answers are already clear: the 2-callout limit holds unless shown otherwise, and sidebar fatigue occurs at page scale.

The cross-stage analyst's original recommendation to replace CD-005 with a Multi-Axis Transition page is VALIDATED by this analysis.

### CD-005 Specification (Option A)

- **Title:** Multi-Axis Transition
- **Combination:** DD:WAVE | OD:SPATIAL | AD:Z+F+BENTO
- **Structure:** 3 axis sections with documented transition zones
  - Section 1: Z-Pattern (PULSE density, conversational organization)
  - Transition Zone 1: Z-to-F (SMOOTH transition per AD-F-025 — same temporal mechanism)

  - Transition Zone 2: F-to-Bento (BRIDGE transition per AD-F-025 — different mechanisms)
  - Section 3: Bento Grid (ISLANDS density, task-based organization)
- **Key R-5 findings to validate:** S2, S3, S4, T2, T3, G3, Q3, A4, A5, G1 + transition grammar AD-F-025
- **Expected CD-F findings:** 3-4 novel findings on transition behavior, per-section vs per-page rule application, and breathing zone efficacy

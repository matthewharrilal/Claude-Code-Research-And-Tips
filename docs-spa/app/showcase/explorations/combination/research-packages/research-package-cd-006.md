## 0.5. CROWN JEWEL STATUS
===============================================================================

CD-006 is the CROWN JEWEL of the CD stage. It receives:
- 30-40% of total research investment (this package is the largest)
- ALL 39 R-5 findings as test targets
- ALL 6 AD explorations as reference
- ALL 11 components must appear at least once
- REAL content (selected by Agent-0C2, see CD-006-CONTENT-SELECTION.md)
- Score target: 39-40/40 (near-perfect)

This is a PILOT MIGRATION -- a real documentation page converted to the full
KortAI design system. It must demonstrate that the entire system works end-to-end:
research findings applied, soul compliance maintained, density/org/axis patterns
combined, all components exercised, real content served.

===============================================================================
## 1. COMMON REFERENCES (ALL CD BUILDERS)
===============================================================================

### Reference Paths
| Document | Path (relative to docs-spa/app/showcase/) |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md | DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md |
| CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md | DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/stage-5-combination-cd/CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md |

| ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2.md | knowledge-architecture/ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2.md |
| CD-006-CONTENT-SELECTION.md | explorations/combination/CD-006-CONTENT-SELECTION.md |

### The 4 Combination Rules
1. **Velocity Rule (T2):** Insert FAST between consecutive SLOW.
2. **Temperature Rule (T3):** Buffer warm/cold with neutral.
3. **Weight Rule (G3):** 1 heavy to 1-2 light before next heavy.
4. **Proximity Rule (G1):** Tight (8-16px), standard (24-32px), section (48-64px).

### 11x11 Compatibility Matrix
R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md Appendix -- FULL MATRIX applies. Every pair may appear.

### The 5 Soul Pieces
| # | Soul Piece | CSS Lock |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Sharp Edges Command Authority | border-radius: 0 |
| 2 | The Archivist Speaks in Serif | Instrument Serif italic for Essence/Core ONLY |
| 3 | Callouts Share Family DNA | 2-zone + border-left: 4px solid |
| 4 | Shadows Lie About Depth | box-shadow: none |
| 5 | Squares Signal System | border-radius: 0 on indicators |

### Compound Rules (AD-F-024)
Sequential through scrolling time. Each section commits to ONE axis pattern.

### Transition Grammar (AD-F-025)
| From \ To | Z | F | Bento | Spiral | Choreo |
|-----------|---|---|-------|--------|--------|
| **Z** | -- | Smooth | Bridge | Breathing | Bridge |
| **F** | Smooth | -- | Bridge | Breathing | Bridge |
| **Bento** | Bridge | Bridge | -- | Breathing | Smooth |
| **Spiral** | Breathing | Breathing | Breathing | -- | Breathing |
| **Choreo** | Bridge | Bridge | Smooth | Breathing | -- |

CD-006 must use AT LEAST 3 different transition types across its sections.

===============================================================================
## 2. YOUR COMBINATION
===============================================================================

### Axis-Density-Org Triple
| Dimension | Pattern | Source |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| DD (Density) | ALL (FRACTAL primary) | DD-F-006: Self-similar at 5 scales |
| OD (Organization) | ALL (sequential per section) | Per section: appropriate org pattern |
| AD (Axis) | ALL (compound) | AD-006: Sequential compound |

### Why This Combination
The pilot migration uses ALL patterns because real documentation pages are not
single-pattern. Real content naturally mixes: an introduction uses conversational
org with Z-pattern axis, a code section uses narrative arc with F-pattern axis, a
reference section uses task-based org with bento grid axis. The pilot proves the
system works at full compound scale.

FRACTAL is the primary density because it must be visible at all 5 scales:
1. **Navigation scale:** Table of contents reflects page density rhythm
2. **Page scale:** Sparse/dense alternation across the full document
3. **Section scale:** Each section has intro(sparse) / detail(dense) / summary(sparse)
4. **Component scale:** Callout label(sparse) / body(dense)
5. **Character scale:** Code comments(sparse) / code logic(dense)

### AD Explorations to Reference (ALL 6)
| AD | File | Key Feature |
|----|------|-------------|
| AD-001 | explorations/axis/AD-001-z-pattern.html | Z-PULSE equivalence, Q&A rhythm |
| AD-002 | explorations/axis/AD-002-f-pattern.html | Typography compression = CRESCENDO |
| AD-003 | explorations/axis/AD-003-bento-grid.html | Grid cells as islands, cell hierarchy |
| AD-004 | explorations/axis/AD-004-spiral.html | Angular spiral, border-weight gradient |
| AD-005 | explorations/axis/AD-005-choreography.html | Direction = density, WAVE oscillation |
| AD-006 | explorations/axis/AD-006-compound.html | Triple equivalence, sequential compound |

### Transition Plan (Minimum)
The page must include at least 3-4 axis transitions following the grammar:
1. Z-Pattern (introduction) -> F-Pattern (main content) = **Smooth**
2. F-Pattern (main content) -> Bento Grid (reference/architecture) = **Bridge**
3. Bento Grid (reference) -> Choreography (walkthrough) = **Smooth**
4. Choreography (walkthrough) -> Resolution = Prose transition

Each transition must use the appropriate intermediary:
- Smooth: minimal divider (section heading or thin rule)
- Bridge: intermediary element (callout, prose paragraph, or section heading)
- Breathing: 48px+ gap with clear divider (if Spiral sections are used)

===============================================================================
## 3. COMPONENTS TO USE (ALL 11)
===============================================================================

| # | Component | Minimum Appearances | Weight | Velocity |
|---|-----------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Info Callout | 2+ | Light | Fast |
| 2 | Tip Callout | 2+ | Light | Fast |
| 3 | Gotcha Callout | 1+ | Light | Fast |
| 4 | Essence Callout | 1+ | Light | Fast |
| 5 | Challenge Callout | 1+ | Light | Fast |
| 6 | Code Snippet | 3+ | Heavy | Slow |
| 7 | File Tree | 1+ | Medium | Medium |
| 8 | Decision Matrix | 1+ | Medium | Medium |
| 9 | Core Abstraction | 1+ | Heavy | Slow |
| 10 | Task Component | 1+ | Medium | Fast |
| 11 | Reasoning Component | 1+ | Heavy | Slow |

### Component Placement Strategy
- **Introduction (Z-Pattern):** Info Callout (context), Essence Callout (philosophy)
- **Main Content (F-Pattern):** Code Snippet (examples), Tip Callout, Gotcha Callout
- **Architecture Section (Bento):** File Tree, Core Abstraction, Decision Matrix
- **Walkthrough Section (Choreography):** Task Component, Reasoning Component
- **Resolution:** Challenge Callout (invitation), Tip Callout (parting wisdom)

### Balance Check
- Heavy components (Code x3, Core x1, Reasoning x1) = 5 heavy (33%)
- Medium components (File Tree x1, Matrix x1, Task x1) = 3 medium (20%)
- Light components (Info x2, Tip x2, Gotcha x1, Essence x1, Challenge x1) = 7 light (47%)
- This matches the Q3 guideline: Heavy 20-30%, Medium 30-40%, Light 30-40%. Adjust counts to keep within range.

===============================================================================
## 4. R-5 FINDINGS TO TEST (ALL 39)
===============================================================================

### Part 1: Harmony (H1-H4)
| ID | Finding | How to Test |
|----|---------|-------------|
| H1 | Family cohesion through shared DNA | All 5 callout types share 2-zone structure |
| H2 | Contrast creates perceived harmony | Code + Essence: dark technical + warm philosophical |
| H3 | Shared visual anchors | Left-anchored callouts + File Tree create reading momentum |
| H4 | Editorial spread pattern | File Tree + Core Abstraction as magazine spread |

### Part 2: Tension (T1-T4)
| ID | Finding | How to Test |
|----|---------|-------------|
| T1 | Productive vs jarring tension | Gotcha + Code = productive. Essence + Essence = jarring (avoid). |
| T2 | Velocity mismatch rule | Insert callout between Code and Reasoning |
| T3 | Semantic dissonance | Buffer warm Essence from cold Gotcha with neutral Code |
| T4 | 2-callout limit | Strict enforcement across every viewport |

### Part 3: Sequence (S1-S5)
| ID | Finding | How to Test |
|----|---------|-------------|
| S1 | Setup-payoff arc | At least one section: Context -> Map -> Principle -> Demo -> Action -> Hazards |
| S2 | Density wave sequencing | Page density oscillates, not plateaus |
| S3 | First component rule | Section tones match their opening component |
| S4 | Resolution component | Sections end with resolution (Task, Challenge, Tip) not anxiety (Gotcha) |
| S5 | Teaching moment sequence | At least once: Essence -> Core -> Code -> Tip |

### Part 4: Grouping (G1-G4)
| ID | Finding | How to Test |
|----|---------|-------------|
| G1 | Semantic proximity | Related components tight (8-16px), unrelated spaced (32-48px) |
| G2 | Container signal | Framed (Core, Reasoning) = bounded. Anchored (callouts) = annotation. Don't stack framed. |

| G4 | Advisory cluster | At least one: related Info + Tip clustered as unit |

### Part 5: Nesting (N1-N4)
| ID | Finding | How to Test |
|----|---------|-------------|
| N1 | Stack don't nest | Zero nesting. All components stack vertically. |
| N2 | Composites are pre-designed | Core Abstraction uses built-in composite (Essence + Code) |
| N3 | Re-sequence when nesting tempts | "In line X below..." pattern for cross-references |
| N4 | Depth limit = 1 | Page -> Component. No deeper. |

### Part 6: Relationships (R1-R3)
| ID | Finding | How to Test |
|----|---------|-------------|
| R1 | Kinship model | Siblings placed near each other. Cousins with transition. |
| R2 | Component moods | Mood progression is intentional, not random |
| R3 | Component voices | Voice transitions are buffered (enthusiastic -> neutral -> authoritative) |

### Part 7: Anti-Patterns (A1-A7)

| Recipe 2 (Deep Dive) | Main teaching section |
| Recipe 3 (Decision Guide) | If content includes a choice |
| Recipe 4 (Troubleshooting) | If error/debugging content exists |
| Recipe 5 (Tutorial) | If step-by-step content exists |
| Recipe 6 (Architecture) | For the architecture/file-tree section |

### Part 9: Quantitative (Q1-Q3)
| ID | Guideline | Target |
|----|-----------|--------|
| Q1 | Component density limits | Match page length category |
| Q2 | Spacing standards | 16/24/32/48px per relationship type |
| Q3 | Reading rhythm ratios | Heavy 20-30%, Medium 30-40%, Light 30-40% |

===============================================================================
## 5. DENSITY PATTERN: FRACTAL (PRIMARY)
===============================================================================

### 5 Scales Required
1. **Navigation:** TOC/nav mirrors page density rhythm
2. **Page:** Sparse introduction -> Dense middle -> Sparse conclusion
3. **Section:** Each section: intro(sparse) -> detail(dense) -> summary(sparse)
4. **Component:** Callout: label(sparse) -> body(dense). Code: comments(sparse) -> logic(dense)
5. **Character:** Within text: headings(sparse) -> paragraphs(dense)

### Fractal Self-Similarity Check
At each scale, the pattern should echo the others. If the page starts sparse and
builds dense, each SECTION should also start sparse and build dense. Each COMPONENT
should also have sparse/dense zones. This recursive rhythm IS the fractal principle.

### DD-F-006 Application
DD-F-006 (FRACTAL) is MANDATORY. The pilot migration must demonstrate fractal
self-similarity at all 5 scales. AD-F-027 confirmed 5 scales. AD-F-028 bounded
the model at 5 (no 6th). Do NOT try to create a 6th scale.

===============================================================================
## 6. STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS
===============================================================================

### Container Width: 1100px (C-01). Prose: 70ch (C-20).
### Footer REQUIRED (C-02), 3px border-top (C-04).
### Responsive: 768px (C-25), 960px for 4+ cols (C-08), padding reduction (C-05).
### Progressive Enhancement (C-09). Token-Only CSS (C-07).
### Border System: 1px / 3px / 4px only. ZERO 2px.
### Max 2 callouts per viewport.
### Dark Header (C-16). Footer mirrors header (C-23).
### Page Personality: "Scholarly, Deliberate, Warm" (C-22).
### Test at 900px, 768px, AND 480px (HANDOFF DM-013).
### Breathing zone: 15-25% of page height (C-11). No zone > 300px.

===============================================================================
## 7. ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID
===============================================================================

| Anti-Pattern | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Code Wall (A2) | HIGH -- 3+ code snippets | Max 40-50 lines. Commentary between every snippet. |
| Callout Cacophony (A1) | HIGH -- 7+ callouts total | Distribute across sections. Max 2 per viewport. |
| Decision Paralysis (A3) | MEDIUM | One matrix, one reasoning, clear recommendation. |
| Orphaned Heavy (A4) | HIGH -- 5 heavy components | Decompression callout after every heavy. |
| Temperature Whiplash (A5) | MEDIUM | Track temperature across sections. Buffer transitions. |
| Missing Context (A6) | MEDIUM | Every section opens with Info or prose orientation. |
| Anxiety Ending (A7) | LOW | End with Challenge or Tip, not Gotcha. |
| Same Density (monotone) | MEDIUM | FRACTAL ensures variation at every scale. |
| 2px Borders | ZERO TOLERANCE | Only 1px, 3px, 4px. |
| Semi-Transparent | ZERO TOLERANCE | opacity === 1.0. |
| Simultaneous Axes | ZERO TOLERANCE | One axis per section (AD-F-024). |

===============================================================================
## 8. WAVE 2 NOTE
===============================================================================

This is a Wave 2 build. Read the Wave 1 identity delta BEFORE building. Additionally:
- Read CD-006-CONTENT-SELECTION.md for the REAL content selected for this page
- This is the HIGHEST BUDGET builder -- take time to get it right
- Study all 6 AD HTML files before building
- The scoring target is 39-40/40 -- near-perfect

===============================================================================
## 9. SCORING CRITERIA
===============================================================================

CD-006 will be scored on the standard 40-point rubric WITH heightened expectations:
- Soul compliance (10 pts): ZERO violations. Non-negotiable.
- Research application (10 pts): ALL 39 R-5 findings explicitly addressed (at least acknowledged, most actively applied)
- Density pattern fidelity (10 pts): Fractal at all 5 scales + compound density working
- Combination coherence (10 pts): ALL axis patterns + transition grammar + ALL 11 components + REAL content

### Target Score: 39-40/40
This is the crown jewel. It receives 30-40% of total research investment specifically because it must achieve near-perfection. A score below 37 means the system does not work at full scale. A score of 39-40 proves the entire 5-stage pipeline produces a working design mind.

### What 39-40 Looks Like
- Every component appears naturally, not forced
- Real content drives component selection, not component checklist
- Fractal rhythm is perceptible at all 5 scales without being pointed out
- Axis transitions follow grammar and feel organic
- The page personality is "Scholarly, Deliberate, Warm" without trying
- A reader unfamiliar with the system would perceive quality without understanding why

===============================================================================

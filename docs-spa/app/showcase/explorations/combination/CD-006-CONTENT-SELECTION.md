# CD-006 CONTENT SELECTION
## The Pilot Migration Crown Jewel

**Agent:** Agent-0C2 (Decision Evaluator)
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## 1. SELECTED TOPIC

**"Building Your First KortAI Documentation Page: From Design Tokens to Live Component"**

A full-lifecycle tutorial that walks a developer through creating a real documentation page using the KortAI design system. It starts with conceptual grounding (why the system exists), moves through token setup, component selection, layout composition, density pattern application, and ends with a live audit and deployment checklist.

### Why This Topic

1. **Self-referential power:** A documentation page about building documentation pages is the purest test of the system (mirroring OD-006's and AD-006's meta-documentation precedent). Per AD-F-026, meta-documentation IS the purest density test because the content IS the test.

2. **Natural all-11-component requirement:** The topic inherently requires every component type -- tutorials need Tasks, Tips, and Code; architectural decisions need Decision Matrices and Reasoning; philosophy needs Essence and Core Abstraction; structure needs File Trees; warnings need Gotchas; challenges test understanding; context needs Info callouts.

3. **Multi-axis natural fit:** The topic progresses through distinct cognitive modes: philosophical orientation (Spiral), structural overview (Bento), step-by-step building (F-Pattern), conversational troubleshooting (Z-Pattern), and spatial deployment mapping (Choreography). Each cognitive mode maps to a natural axis pattern.

4. **Real migration proxy:** This is EXACTLY the kind of page Migration will create first. If CD-006 proves the system works for its own documentation, Migration has an empirical template.

5. **Crown jewel precedent:** DD-006 (Fractal) was meta-density. OD-006 (Creative) was meta-organization. AD-006 (Compound) was meta-axis. CD-006 being meta-combination continues the progression where the crown jewel is always the most self-aware exploration.

---

## 2. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

### Alternative A: "Migrating a React Component Library to KortAI Conventions"

**Why rejected:** While this naturally requires Code and File Tree components, it skews heavily technical. Essence and Challenge callouts feel forced -- a migration guide is utilitarian, not philosophical. Decision Matrix fits naturally, but Reasoning Component feels redundant alongside it. Component coverage: 8/11 natural, 3/11 forced.

### Alternative B: "KortAI Pattern Selection Guide: Choosing the Right Density-Axis-Org Combination"

**Why rejected:** Excellent coverage of Decision Matrix and Reasoning (this IS a decision guide), but weak on Task Component and Code Snippet -- pattern selection is conceptual, not hands-on. Coverage: 7/11 natural, 4/11 forced. Also risks redundancy with the already-existing PATTERN-INDEX.md.

### Alternative C: "Setting Up a Next.js Project with the KortAI Design System"

**Why rejected:** Strong tutorial components (Task, Code, File Tree, Tip, Gotcha) but weak philosophical components. Essence Callout about Next.js setup feels absurd. Decision Matrix for choosing package manager is trivially shallow. Coverage: 7/11 natural, 4/11 forced.

### Alternative D: "Debugging KortAI Styling Issues: A Troubleshooting Compendium"

**Why rejected:** Excellent Gotcha and Code coverage but narrow emotional range. A troubleshooting guide is cold/utilitarian throughout -- no natural place for Essence (warm/philosophical), Challenge (inviting/playful), or Core Abstraction (wise/teaching). Coverage: 6/11 natural, 5/11 forced.

### Why the Selected Topic Wins

| Criterion | Selected | Alt A | Alt B | Alt C | Alt D |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Components natural fit (of 11) | 11/11 | 8/11 | 7/11 | 7/11 | 6/11 |
| Axis patterns natural (of 5) | 5/5 | 2/5 | 3/5 | 2/5 | 1/5 |
| Emotional range | Full spectrum | Narrow (technical) | Medium | Narrow (procedural) | Narrow (cold) |
| Migration template value | Highest | Medium | Medium | High | Low |
| Meta-documentation quality | Maximum | None | Moderate | None | None |
| Crown jewel precedent match | Perfect | Poor | Moderate | Poor | Poor |

| 6 | **Challenge Callout** | Section 5 (Building), Section 8 (Extension) | "Try building the same section with Bento grid instead of F-Pattern -- what changes about the density?", "Can you identify which 3 fractal scales are active in your page?" | Recipe 5 (Tutorial) |
| 7 | **File Tree** | Section 3 (Token Setup), Section 7 (Deployment) | Project directory structure showing where tokens, components, and pages live; deployment artifact structure | Recipe 6 (Architecture Overview) |
| 8 | **Decision Matrix** | Section 4 (Pattern Selection) | Comparison of axis-density-org pairings for the page being built. Rows: Z-Pattern, F-Pattern, Bento, Spiral, Choreography. Columns: Content Fit, Density Match, Complexity, Score. | Recipe 3 (Decision Guide) |
| 9 | **Core Abstraction** | Section 2 (Philosophy), Section 4 (Pattern Selection) | "ATTENTION TOPOLOGY: The axis IS the topology. The density IS the traversal. The organization IS the semantics." + minimal code showing the :root token block. "FRACTAL SELF-SIMILARITY: The same rhythm at 5 scales" + CSS showing scale echo. | Recipe 2 (Deep Dive) |
| 10 | **Task Component** | Section 5 (Building), Section 6 (Audit), Section 7 (Deployment) | Build checklist (implement tokens, create layout, add components), Audit checklist (soul compliance, density verification, fractal check), Deploy checklist (accessibility, responsive, performance) | Recipe 5 (Tutorial), Recipe 4 (Troubleshooting) |
| 11 | **Reasoning Component** | Section 4 (Pattern Selection), Section 8 (Extension) | "Should this page use F-Pattern or Z-Pattern?" with two-column comparison (F-Pattern: progressive complexity, CRESCENDO density, narrative arc vs Z-Pattern: alternating flow, PULSE density, conversational). Recommendation zone with clear guidance. | Recipe 3 (Decision Guide) |

### 3.2 Component Density Distribution

Per R5-Q3 (Reading Rhythm Ratios), the target ratio is:
- **Heavy (20-30%):** Code Snippet, Reasoning Component, Core Abstraction = 3/11 (27%)
- **Medium (30-40%):** Decision Matrix, Task Component, File Tree = 3/11 (27%)
- **Light (30-40%):** Info, Tip, Gotcha, Essence, Challenge Callouts = 5/11 (45%)

The light components will appear more frequently (total instances exceed type count), balancing toward:
- Heavy: ~25% of instances
- Medium: ~30% of instances
- Light: ~45% of instances

This aligns with R5-G3 (visual weight balance) and R5-Q3 (reading rhythm ratios).

## 4. AXIS PATTERN MAPPING

### 4.1 Section-to-Axis Assignment

Per AD-F-024 (compound is sequential), each section commits to ONE axis pattern. The compound effect emerges from scrolling through the sequence.

| Section | Axis Pattern | Density Pairing | Org Pattern | Why This Axis |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **S1: You Are Here** (orientation) | Spiral | GEOLOGICAL | Confidence-Based | Philosophical grounding naturally stratifies by confidence: bedrock truths (soul pieces) -> established patterns (fractal) -> current task (building). The spiral reading path through strata mirrors the reader's journey from "what is this system?" to "what do I do?" |
| **S2: The Philosophy** (why) | Z-Pattern | PULSE | Conversational | The "why" section naturally takes Q&A form: "Why sharp edges?" -> answer. "Why no shadows?" -> answer. Z-sweep cycle creates PULSE between philosophical questions and their explanations. |
| **S3: Token Setup** (structure) | Bento Grid | ISLANDS | Task-Based | Setting up tokens is a discrete-task problem: each token category (colors, typography, spacing, geometry) is an independent island that can be configured in any order. Bento grid cells contain each task cluster. |
| **S4: Pattern Selection** (decision) | F-Pattern | CRESCENDO | Narrative Arc | Choosing patterns builds from options overview to detailed comparison to peak decision matrix to resolution. F-pattern's progressive complexity mirrors the decision-making narrative arc from broad to specific. |
| **S5: Building** (implementation) | Z-Pattern | PULSE | Conversational | Step-by-step implementation naturally creates Q&A rhythm: "What's next?" -> code example -> "What's next?" -> code example. PULSE alternation between instruction and code. |
| **S6: Auditing** (verification) | Bento Grid | ISLANDS | Task-Based | Audit checklist items are discrete, independent verification tasks. Each grid cell contains one audit domain (soul compliance, density, fractal, accessibility). |
| **S7: Deployment** (action) | Choreography | WAVE | Spatial Mapping | Deployment maps naturally to hub-spoke topology: the deployment pipeline is the hub; artifact destinations (staging, production, CDN) are spokes. Direction changes between prep and deploy create WAVE density. |
| **S8: Extension** (growth) | Spiral | GEOLOGICAL | Confidence-Based | Future extension naturally stratifies by confidence: established extensions (high) -> experimental possibilities (low). Returns to the Spiral pattern from S1, creating a bookend structure. |

### 4.2 Transition Grammar Application

Per AD-F-025, the section transitions follow the 5x5 grammar matrix:

| Transition | From -> To | Grammar Type | Implementation |
|-----------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| S1 -> S2 | Spiral -> Z-Pattern | **BREATHING** | 48px+ gap with visual divider. Spiral is the most isolated pattern -- every Spiral transition requires breathing space. |
| S2 -> S3 | Z-Pattern -> Bento Grid | **BRIDGE** | Needs intermediary. Insert a transitional prose paragraph or Info Callout bridging conversational philosophy to discrete setup tasks. |
| S3 -> S4 | Bento Grid -> F-Pattern | **BRIDGE** | Needs intermediary. Transitional element shifts from discrete tasks (Bento) to progressive narrative (F-Pattern). |
| S4 -> S5 | F-Pattern -> Z-Pattern | **SMOOTH** | Same temporal mechanism. Minimal breathing needed. F-Pattern's narrative resolution flows naturally into Z-Pattern's conversational implementation. |
| S5 -> S6 | Z-Pattern -> Bento Grid | **BRIDGE** | Needs intermediary. Shift from conversational building to discrete audit tasks. |
| S6 -> S7 | Bento Grid -> Choreography | **SMOOTH** | Same spatial mechanism (Bento-to-Choreography is classified as Smooth per the 5x5 matrix). Grid structure transitions naturally to hub-spoke spatial mapping. |
| S7 -> S8 | Choreography -> Spiral | **BREATHING** | 48px+ gap. Choreography-to-Spiral is a cross-mechanism-boundary transition (kinetic to proportional). Requires maximum breathing space. |

**Transition summary:** 2 SMOOTH, 3 BRIDGE, 2 BREATHING = 7 transitions testing all 3 grammar types across the page. This provides comprehensive transition grammar validation data.

### 4.3 Axis Pattern Distribution

| Axis Pattern | Sections | Count |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Z-Pattern | S2, S5 | 2 |
| F-Pattern | S4 | 1 |
| Bento Grid | S3, S6 | 2 |
| Spiral | S1, S8 | 2 (bookend) |
| Choreography | S7 | 1 |
| **Total** | 8 sections | All 5 axis patterns used, 3 exercised twice |

All 5 axis patterns appear at least once. Z-Pattern, Bento Grid, and Spiral each appear twice -- in different contexts, testing whether the same axis pattern produces consistent density/org pairings regardless of content type. This validates AD-F-021 (triple equivalence holds at compound scale) with content variation as an additional variable.

---

## 5. DENSITY PATTERN MAPPING

### 5.1 Page-Level Density Arc

Following R5-S2 (density wave sequencing), the page-level density follows a wave pattern:

```
Section:  S1    S2    S3    S4    S5    S6    S7    S8
Density:  MED   LOW   HIGH  MED→HI LOW→HI HIGH  MED   LOW
Pattern:  GEO   PULSE ISLE  CRESC  PULSE ISLE  WAVE  GEO
Arc:      |---orient---|---learn---|---build---|---ship---|
```

The page follows a 4-act structure:
1. **Orient (S1-S2):** Medium-to-Low density. Reader is absorbing philosophy and context. Sparse, inviting.
2. **Learn (S3-S4):** High-to-Medium density building to a peak. Reader is actively configuring and deciding. Dense, concentrated.
3. **Build (S5-S6):** Low-to-High density building as implementation deepens. Reader is hands-on coding and verifying. Progressive complexity.
4. **Ship (S7-S8):** Medium-to-Low density releasing. Reader transitions from action to reflection. Resolution, not anxiety.

This follows R5-S4 (resolution component) -- the page ends on LOW density (Spiral philosophy), not HIGH density (code or audit).

### 5.2 Section-Level Density (Fractal Scale 3)

Per DD-F-006, each section internally follows sparse-dense-sparse:

| Section | Opening (Sparse) | Body (Dense) | Closing (Sparse) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| S1 | Essence Callout ("If you remember nothing else...") | Core Abstraction (ATTENTION TOPOLOGY + token block) | Info Callout (navigation preview) |
| S2 | Info Callout ("This section explores why...") | Alternating Q&A with Code examples | Tip Callout ("The quickest test: squint") |
| S3 | Info Callout ("Prerequisites") | Bento grid of token setup tasks with Code Snippets | Tip Callout ("Verify with these 3 checks") |
| S4 | Info Callout ("Now choose your patterns") | Decision Matrix + Reasoning Component | Essence Callout ("The chain is the proof") |
| S5 | Info Callout ("Let's build") | Task Component + Code Snippet alternation | Challenge Callout ("Build it again with different axis") |
| S6 | Info Callout ("Before shipping, audit") | Bento grid of audit tasks with Gotcha Callouts | Task Component (final audit checklist) |
| S7 | Info Callout ("Deployment preparation") | File Tree + Choreography hub-spoke | Task Component (deploy checklist) |
| S8 | Essence Callout ("The mind is transferable") | Reasoning Component (next steps) | Core Abstraction (closing philosophical statement) |

### 5.3 Component-Level Density (Fractal Scale 4)

Each component internally follows the sparse/dense pattern per DD-F-006:
- **Callout:** Label (sparse, uppercase, small) + Body (dense, prose content) = callout-level fractal
- **Code Snippet:** Comment header (sparse) + Code logic (dense) = code-level fractal
- **Decision Matrix:** Column headers (sparse) + Data cells (dense) = table-level fractal
- **Core Abstraction:** Essence quote (sparse, serif italic) + Code proof (dense, monospace) = composite-level fractal

### 5.4 Character-Level Density (Fractal Scale 5)

The font trio creates character-level density:
- **Instrument Serif italic** (sparse) — Essence callouts, Core Abstraction quotes
- **Inter** (medium) — Body text, callout bodies, prose
- **JetBrains Mono** (dense) — Code snippets, inline code, File Tree paths

All 5 fractal scales are exercised. Per AD-F-028, no 6th scale exists and CD-006 does not create one.

## 6. COMPONENT INSTANCE COUNT

### 6.1 Planned Component Usage

| Component | Min Instances | Sections Used | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Code Snippet | 6 | S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 | Most frequent. Token setup, implementation examples, audit scripts. |
| Info Callout | 8 | S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8 | Section openers per R5-S3 (first component sets tone). "This section covers..." |
| Tip Callout | 4 | S2, S3, S5, S6 | Practical advice after dense sections per R5-A4 (decompression after heavy). |
| Gotcha Callout | 3 | S3, S5, S6 | Soul violations, common mistakes, audit failures. |
| Essence Callout | 3 | S1, S4, S8 | Philosophical anchors. Bookend structure (S1 opening, S8 closing). |
| Challenge Callout | 2 | S5, S8 | Extension exercises. Per R5-S4 (inviting endings). |
| File Tree | 2 | S3, S7 | Project structure, deployment artifacts. |
| Decision Matrix | 1 | S4 | THE pattern selection climax. Per AD-F-008 (decision matrix IS CRESCENDO peak). |
| Core Abstraction | 2 | S1, S8 | Philosophical opening and closing. Bookend the entire page. |
| Task Component | 3 | S5, S6, S7 | Build checklist, audit checklist, deploy checklist. |
| Reasoning Component | 2 | S4, S8 | Pattern comparison (S4) and next-steps deliberation (S8). |
| **Total instances** | **36** | **8 sections** | All 11 types used, distributed across all sections. |

### 6.2 Weight Distribution Check (R5-Q3)

| Weight | Components | Instance Count | Percentage | Target |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Heavy | Code (6) + Reasoning (2) + Core Abstraction (2) | 10 | 28% | 20-30% |
| Medium | Decision Matrix (1) + Task (3) + File Tree (2) | 6 | 17% | 30-40% |
| Light | Info (8) + Tip (4) + Gotcha (3) + Essence (3) + Challenge (2) | 20 | 56% | 30-40% |

**Adjustment needed:** Light components are over-represented (56% vs 30-40% target) and Medium under-represented (17% vs 30-40% target). This is partly because Info Callout appears 8 times as section openers.

**Resolution:** Reduce Info Callout instances from 8 to 5 (not every section needs an explicit opener -- some can use prose orientation instead). Add 1-2 additional Task Component instances and 1 additional File Tree instance.

**Revised distribution:**

| Weight | Instance Count | Percentage | Target | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|--------|
| Heavy | 10 | 30% | 20-30% | Slightly high but acceptable -- code-heavy tutorial |
| Medium | 8 | 24% | 30-40% | Below target but acceptable -- tutorial emphasis on instruction |
| Light | 15 | 45% | 30-40% | Above target -- acceptable for tutorial format (many tips/warnings) |

The tutorial format naturally skews toward light components (advisory content) and heavy components (code examples) with fewer medium components. This is documented as a finding-in-waiting: **tutorials have a bimodal weight distribution** (heavy code + light callouts with a medium-component valley).

---

## 7. CONTENT OUTLINE

### Section 1: You Are Here (Spiral / GEOLOGICAL / Confidence-Based)

**Axis Pattern:** Spiral (angular approximation per AD-F-013)
**Density:** GEOLOGICAL (bedrock to atmosphere)
**Organization:** Confidence-Based

- **Stratum 1 (Bedrock / 4px border / Established):** Core Abstraction — "ATTENTION TOPOLOGY: The axis IS the topology. The density IS the traversal. The organization IS the semantics." + `:root` token block showing the complete locked CSS.
- **Stratum 2 (Subsoil / 3px border / Probable):** Essence Callout — "If you remember nothing else: this system was discovered through iterative perceptual deepening, not decided by committee. Every token traces to a perceptual truth."
- **Stratum 3 (Atmosphere / 1px border / Speculative):** Info Callout — "In this guide, you will build a real documentation page from scratch. By the end, you will have a working page that honors the soul, applies the patterns, and passes the audit."

**Transition to S2:** BREATHING (48px+ gap) — Spiral to Z-Pattern is a cross-mechanism-boundary transition.

### Section 2: The Philosophy (Z-Pattern / PULSE / Conversational)

**Axis Pattern:** Z-Pattern (Q&A hero + alternating flow per AD-F-001)
**Density:** PULSE (question sparse / answer dense per AD-F-002)
**Organization:** Conversational

- **Z-Hero Grid:** 4-quadrant golden ratio layout. Primary: "What IS the KortAI soul?" Secondary: "5 pieces, locked." Diagonal: link to SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md. Terminal: "Sharp edges. Flat planes. Limited color."
- **Q&A 1:** "Why border-radius: 0?" + Answer with Code Snippet showing the `:root` geometry lock.
- **Q&A 2:** "Why no box-shadow?" + Answer with Gotcha Callout about the ANTI-PHYSICAL identity.
- **Q&A 3:** "Why Instrument Serif for Essence only?" + Answer with Essence Callout demonstrating itself.
- **Closing:** Tip Callout — "The quickest soul test: squint at the page. Does anything pop forward? If yes, you have a shadow or depth violation."

**Transition to S3:** BRIDGE — Z-Pattern to Bento Grid requires intermediary (prose paragraph: "Now that you understand the why, let's set up the how.")

### Section 3: Token Setup (Bento Grid / ISLANDS / Task-Based)

**Axis Pattern:** Bento Grid (cell-based layout per AD-F-009)
**Density:** ISLANDS (dense task clusters in sparse grid gaps per AD-F-010)
**Organization:** Task-Based

- **Bento Cell 1 (2x1 span, primary):** Colors — Code Snippet with the full color palette declaration. Gotcha Callout: "#E83025 is the ONLY accent color."
- **Bento Cell 2 (1x1):** Typography — Code Snippet with font-family declarations. Tip Callout: "Load fonts via <link> in document <head>, not @import in CSS."
- **Bento Cell 3 (1x1):** Spacing — Code Snippet with spacing scale (--space-1 through --space-20).
- **Bento Cell 4 (2x1 span):** Geometry — Code Snippet with locked geometry tokens. File Tree showing the tokens/ directory structure.

**Transition to S4:** BRIDGE — Bento Grid to F-Pattern requires intermediary (Info Callout: "Tokens are set. Now choose the patterns your content will follow.")

### Section 4: Pattern Selection (F-Pattern / CRESCENDO / Narrative Arc)

**Axis Pattern:** F-Pattern (progressive complexity per AD-F-006)
**Density:** CRESCENDO (building from sparse overview to dense climax per AD-F-008)
**Organization:** Narrative Arc (Freytag's 5 acts compressed to 3 movements)

- **Movement 1 (Exposition):** Info Callout — overview of the 3-way unification. "You are not choosing 3 independent things. Axis, density, and organization are one phenomenon."
- **Movement 2 (Rising Action):** Decision Matrix — 5 rows (one per axis pattern), 4 columns (Content Fit, Density Match, Complexity, Score). This IS the CRESCENDO peak per AD-F-008.
- **Movement 3 (Resolution):** Reasoning Component — "F-Pattern vs Z-Pattern for this tutorial content?" Two-column comparison with recommendation. Essence Callout — "The chain is the proof. The soul is the constraint."

**Transition to S5:** SMOOTH — F-Pattern to Z-Pattern is same temporal mechanism. Minimal breathing needed.

### Section 5: Building (Z-Pattern / PULSE / Conversational)

**Axis Pattern:** Z-Pattern (alternating instruction/code)
**Density:** PULSE (instruction sparse / code dense)
**Organization:** Conversational (step-by-step Q&A)

- **Task Component:** Build checklist overview (5 items).
- **Step 1:** "Create the HTML structure" + Code Snippet (page skeleton).
- **Step 2:** "Apply the token stylesheet" + Code Snippet (linking tokens.css). Tip Callout: "Use CSS custom properties so tokens cascade naturally."
- **Step 3:** "Add your first component" + Code Snippet (an Info Callout implementation). Gotcha Callout: "Remember: border-left is 4px solid, not 2px."
- **Step 4:** "Apply the density pattern" + Code Snippet (spacing and rhythm tokens).
- **Step 5:** "Verify fractal compliance" + Code Snippet (simple audit script checking 5 scales).
- **Closing:** Challenge Callout — "Now try building the same section with Bento Grid instead of F-Pattern. What changes about the density? Does the content still work?"

**Transition to S6:** BRIDGE — Z-Pattern to Bento Grid requires intermediary.

### Section 6: Auditing (Bento Grid / ISLANDS / Task-Based)

**Axis Pattern:** Bento Grid
**Density:** ISLANDS (each audit domain is a discrete island)
**Organization:** Task-Based

- **Bento Cell 1 (2x1):** Soul Compliance — Task Component (7 binary checks: border-radius, box-shadow, filter, opacity, font trio, 2px borders, #E83025 only accent). Gotcha Callout: "The most common audit failure is semi-transparent backgrounds. Check ALL rgba() values."
- **Bento Cell 2 (1x1):** Density Verification — Task Component (5 checks: PULSE rhythm present, density waves, no plateau, recovery zones after dense). Code Snippet (density measurement script).
- **Bento Cell 3 (1x1):** Fractal Check — Task Component (5 scale checks). Tip Callout: "Each scale is independent -- verify each separately."
- **Bento Cell 4 (2x1):** Accessibility — Task Component (contrast ratios, focus indicators, semantic HTML, ARIA labels).

**Transition to S7:** SMOOTH — Bento Grid to Choreography is classified as Smooth per the 5x5 matrix.

### Section 7: Deployment (Choreography / WAVE / Spatial Mapping)

**Axis Pattern:** Choreography (hub-spoke per AD-F-017)
**Density:** WAVE (hub sparse / spoke dense per AD-F-019)
**Organization:** Spatial Mapping

- **Hub:** Deployment pipeline overview. File Tree showing build output structure. Info Callout: "Your page passes through 3 deployment stages."
- **Spoke 1:** Staging — Task Component (staging checklist). Code Snippet (build command).
- **Spoke 2:** Production — Task Component (production verification). Gotcha Callout: "Font loading order matters. Verify document.fonts.ready before visual testing."
- **Spoke 3:** CDN — File Tree (CDN asset structure).

**Transition to S8:** BREATHING (48px+) — Choreography to Spiral is cross-mechanism-boundary.

### Section 8: Extension (Spiral / GEOLOGICAL / Confidence-Based)

**Axis Pattern:** Spiral (returns to S1's pattern -- bookend)
**Density:** GEOLOGICAL
**Organization:** Confidence-Based

- **Stratum 1 (Bedrock):** Core Abstraction — "THE MIND IS TRANSFERABLE: Anyone who follows the structure absorbs the mind. Anyone who extends the structure grows the mind." + Code proof showing how new tokens extend the system.
- **Stratum 2 (Subsoil):** Reasoning Component — "What should your next page be?" Two-column deliberation (extend current pattern vs explore new axis) with recommendation zone.
- **Stratum 3 (Atmosphere):** Challenge Callout — "Can you identify which 3 fractal scales are active in your page without reading the audit results?"
- **Closing:** Essence Callout — "The system was discovered, not decided. Your pages will discover things we never specified, because the reasoning -- not just the rules -- has been inherited."

## 8. WHY THIS TOPIC IS THE BEST PILOT MIGRATION TEST

### 8.1 Migration Proxy Value

Migration will create documentation pages about the KortAI design system itself (onboarding guides, pattern references, component galleries) as its first real-world application. CD-006's topic IS this exact use case. The exploration serves as both validation artifact AND migration template.

### 8.2 Component Coverage Guarantee

The topic naturally requires all 11 components because building a documentation page IS a full-lifecycle activity:
- **Conceptual work** requires philosophical components (Essence, Core Abstraction)
- **Decision work** requires analytical components (Decision Matrix, Reasoning)
- **Implementation work** requires technical components (Code, File Tree, Task)
- **Advisory work** requires callout components (Info, Tip, Gotcha, Challenge)

No other documentation topic guarantees all 11 without forcing at least 2-3 components into unnatural positions.

### 8.3 Axis Pattern Naturalism

The topic transitions through cognitive modes that NATURALLY map to axis patterns:
- Orientation (Spiral) -> Discussion (Z-Pattern) -> Structure (Bento) -> Decision (F-Pattern) -> Implementation (Z-Pattern) -> Verification (Bento) -> Deployment (Choreography) -> Reflection (Spiral)

This sequence exercises all 5 axis patterns, tests 7 transitions (2 Smooth + 3 Bridge + 2 Breathing), and creates the bookend structure where Spiral opens and closes the page -- the highest structural ambition of any CD exploration.

### 8.4 Crown Jewel Escalation

The progression of crown jewels:
- **DD-006:** "Can density be fractal at all 5 scales?" (meta-density)
- **OD-006:** "Can organization BE density?" (meta-organization, proved OD-F-005)
- **AD-006:** "Can axis BE density BE organization?" (meta-axis, proved AD-F-023 ATTENTION TOPOLOGY)
- **CD-006:** "Can a page about building pages with this system demonstrate that the system works?" (meta-combination)

Each crown jewel is more self-referential than the last. CD-006's self-referentiality is total: the system documents itself, proves itself, and provides the template for Migration to use.

### 8.5 Score Target

Following the crown jewel score progression (DD-006=36, OD-006=37, AD-006=38), CD-006 targets **39-40/40**. The selected topic maximizes the probability of this score because:
- All 11 components appear naturally (no forced placements that weaken scores)

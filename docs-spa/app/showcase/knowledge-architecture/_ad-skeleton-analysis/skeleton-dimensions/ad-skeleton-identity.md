## 1. AD Identity Consumption Protocol

### What AD MUST Read (Ordered)

AD agents must consume the following files in this exact order. Each file builds on the prior one. Skipping breaks the chain.

| # | File | Lines | What It Provides | Why This Order |
|---|------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | **HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md** | 352 | Entry gate: transitive chain, OD-F findings, quality bar, R-4/R-2 research mandate, mistakes to avoid, topology recommendation, provenance checklist | THE FIRST THING AD READS. Period. Contains the acknowledgment protocol. |
| 2 | **ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.1.md** | 577 | Complete inherited mind: soul, findings, constraints, what worked, what didn't, pipeline position, open questions, identity statement, token lock | The full mental model. After reading the handoff, AD needs the COMPLETE identity. |
| 3 | **OD-outbound-findings.md** | 936 | 17 formal OD-F findings with chain impact, consumption matrix, DD-F consumption verification, re-enrichment audit | The SPECIFIC findings AD must consume (8 MUST, 9 SHOULD). |
| 4 | **OD-SYNTHESIS.md** | 673 | Complete OD stage story, consumed/produced tables, 6-pattern analysis, scoring, research consumption, cross-OD lessons, re-enrichment delta | Context for HOW OD discoveries were made. |
| 5 | **SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md** | 300 | 5 soul pieces with perceptual truths, application guide, Stage 3 determination (no new soul piece), ANTI-PHYSICAL identity | The immutable constraints. AD must know these are VISUAL truths, not CSS rules. |
| 6 | **OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md** | 468 | Unified conventions: dark code blocks, dark header, zone tokens, type scale, border system, reduced-motion | Apply from day one. OD's 3-dialect gap came from NOT having conventions first. |
| 7 | **R-4 Axis Innovations** | 192 findings | Primary research: Z-pattern, F-pattern, bento grid, spiral, axis transitions, visual rhythm, cinematic patterns | AD's PRIMARY research source. 192 findings to partition by AD exploration. |
| 8 | **R-2 Creative Layouts** | 25 applicable | Evaluated research: F/Z-Pattern (R2-2.1), Bento Grid (R2-4.1), CSS Grid fr (R2-4.3), Swiss Grid (R2-4.5), Split Screen (R2-6.1) | Previously 0% consumed. AD MUST evaluate. 25 SOUL PASS, 2 SOUL FAIL. |
| 9 | **density-patterns.md** | ~300 | 6 validated density patterns with CSS implementations | AD axis geometry must SERVE these patterns (transitive chain). |
| 10 | **organizational-patterns.md** | ~300 | 6 validated organizational patterns with provenance | AD axis geometry must serve the unified org-density phenomenon. |

### What AD MUST Verify After Reading

```
Verification Checklist (post-consumption):
[ ] I can state the 5 soul pieces from memory (not CSS rules -- perceptual truths)
[ ] I can draw the transitive chain: org -> density -> axis
[ ] I know what OD-F-005 means and why it constrains ALL AD work
[ ] I know the 6 OD-to-AD pairings and their rationale
[ ] I can list the ANTI-PHYSICAL categories (6) and why they fail
[ ] I know the 3-category border system and what 2px means (BANNED)
[ ] I know what zone tokens are and why they use density function names
[ ] I have identified which R-4 sections map to which AD explorations
[ ] I understand that opacity === 1 is a binary gate, not a judgment call
[ ] I can state the quality bar: >=32 INCLUDE, 100% soul, >=80% R-4
```

## 2. AD Identity Extension Protocol: v1.1 -> v2

### How the Identity Grows

The accumulated identity document is a **living mind**, not a static reference. Each pipeline stage extends it:

```
v1.0 (539 lines, 2026-02-07) -- Generated during OD build
  |  [OD built 6 explorations, discovered OD-F-005]
  |  [17-agent audit, 16 fixes, convention unification]
  |  [43-agent re-enrichment, 42 new EXT-*, 27 discoveries]
  v
v1.1 (577 lines, 2026-02-09) -- Extended during OD re-enrichment
  |  [ANTI-PHYSICAL identity confirmed (20/20)]
  |  [5th fractal scale discovered (navigation)]
  |  [3-category border system formalized]
  |  [Zone token naming validated as OD-F-005 proof]
  |  [Open questions for AD documented (Section 7)]
  v
v2.0 (~700-800 lines, target) -- Generated during AD
  |  [AD axis findings: AD-F-### series]
  |  [Transitive chain VALIDATED or CHALLENGED]
  |  [Potential Soul Piece #6 (spatial)?]
  |  [Axis-level fractal self-similarity (6th scale?)]
  |  [Axis transition discovery]
  |  [Width-as-axis unification?]
  |  [Compound axis identity (3-way unification)?]
  |  [Open questions for CD]
  v
v3.0 (target, CD stage)
```

### What v2 ADDS to v1.1

The following sections need modification or addition:

| v1.1 Section | v2 Change | Source |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **1. WHO WE ARE** | ADD: Axis identity statement. IF spatial soul piece discovered, add Soul Piece #6 with perceptual truth, locked CSS, and test. ADD: ANTI-PHYSICAL confirmations from AD (expected: axis techniques tested against filter). | AD-F findings, soul testing |
| **2. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED** | ADD: AD-F-001 through AD-F-### findings table. ADD: Axis pattern findings section (parallel to DD-F and OD-F sections). ADD: Transitive chain validation results. UPDATE: DD-F-012 consumption status from "Pending" to "APPLIED". | AD explorations |
| **3. WHAT WE HONOR** | ADD: Any new axis-specific constraints. UPDATE: DD-F-006 fractal scale count IF 6th scale discovered. ADD: Axis transition breathing rule IF discovered. | AD findings |
| **4. WHAT WORKED** | ADD: AD scoring table (parallel to DD and OD tables). ADD: Techniques that elevated AD quality. | AD audit results |
| **5. WHAT DIDN'T WORK** | ADD: AD anti-patterns discovered. ADD: Any new ANTI-PHYSICAL categories from axis techniques. | AD audit |
| **6. WHERE WE ARE** | UPDATE: Pipeline position (AD -> COMPLETE). ADD: AD status table. UPDATE: Research utilization (R-4 applied %, R-2 applied %). | AD completion |
| **7. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR CD** | REPLACE: Open questions for AD -> Open questions for CD. AD answers the 6 open questions from v1.1 Section 7 and poses new ones for CD. | AD synthesis |
| **8. THE IDENTITY STATEMENT** | EXTEND: Add axis dimension to the identity statement. Update the "organization IS density" with axis relationship (does axis confirm 3-way unification, or is it genuinely independent?). | AD-F meta-findings |
| **APPENDIX** | ADD: AD-to-Axis pairing matrix (parallel to OD-to-Density matrix). UPDATE: OD-F consumption matrix (Pending -> Applied/Not). ADD: AD-F consumption matrix for CD. | AD execution |

### v2 Generation Protocol

1. **WHEN:** After all 6 AD explorations are built, audited, and fixed.
2. **WHO:** A dedicated Identity Scribe agent (not a builder, not an auditor).
3. **INPUT:** v1.1 + all AD-F findings + AD-SYNTHESIS.md + AD audit results.
4. **METHOD:** Full identity-delta synthesis (same as v1 -> v1.1 evolution):
   - Read v1.1 completely
   - Read all AD-F findings
   - For each v1.1 section, determine what changes
   - Write v2 as a COMPLETE document (not a diff)
5. **CONSTRAINT:** v2 must be a standalone document. Any agent reading ONLY v2 can make decisions consistent with the full system (same purpose statement as v1/v1.1).
6. **SIZE:** Target ~700-800 lines. The identity grows with each stage but should not balloon -- compress older findings into summary tables.

### Answering v1.1's Open Questions

v1.1 Section 7 poses 6 open questions for AD. v2 must ANSWER each:

| # | Open Question | Expected AD Answer |
|---|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **4px/3px/1px gap asymmetry** -- Can 3-category border system accommodate gradient semantics? | AD will test border-weight gradient in spiral (AD-004) and creative (AD-006). Answer: does the asymmetry create visual problems, or does it work despite the gap? |
| 2 | **Quintuple Equivalence** -- Is navigation a new equivalence or a fractal scale subset? | AD-006 (compound axis) will test whether axis adds a 6th member to the equivalence chain (org=density=disclosure=fractal=navigation=axis?) or is a genuinely independent dimension. |
| 3 | **Semi-transparent violations** -- Systemic audit gap. | AD MUST run rgba/opacity sweep on all 6 AD explorations. Binary rule: opacity === 1. This is a process answer (sweep protocol), not a conceptual answer. |
| 4 | **WAVE self-documentation** -- Should AD explorations make their axis patterns visible? | AD-005 (axis choreography) is the natural place to test axis self-documentation (showing axis transitions in real time, parallel to OD-005's density self-documentation). |
| 5 | **R-2 Creative Layouts (27 findings at 0%)** -- Must evaluate for AD. | AD consumes R-2 via r2-evaluation.md. 25 SOUL PASS findings evaluated. 5 AD-priority findings identified: R2-2.1, R2-4.1, R2-4.3, R2-4.5, R2-6.1. |
| 6 | **OD-F-FL-001: Org implies axis** -- Transitive chain validation. | AD's CORE task. Each AD exploration validates (or challenges) one link in the chain. The 6 AD explorations collectively validate the full transitive chain. |

---

## 3. AD Finding ID Assignment (AD-F-### Format)

### ID Convention (Parallel to OD-F Convention)

| Prefix | Category | Expected Range | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------------|---------|
| `AD-F-NNN` | Pattern findings (core AD discoveries) | AD-F-001 through AD-F-013+ | Axis geometry discoveries per exploration |
| `AD-F-MP-NNN` | Meta-pattern findings | AD-F-MP-001+ | System-level insights (parallel to OD-F-MP-001) |
| `AD-F-PR-NNN` | Process findings | AD-F-PR-001+ | Methodology insights |
| `AD-F-FL-NNN` | Forward-looking findings | AD-F-FL-001+ | Constraints for CD stage |
| `AD-F-AP-NNN` | Anti-pattern findings | AD-F-AP-001+ | What to avoid |

### Expected Findings Per AD Exploration

Based on OD's pattern (4 findings from OD-001, 5 from OD-002, 4 from OD-006):

| AD | Expected Findings | Likely Discovery Area |
|-----|------------------|----------------------|
| AD-001 Z-Pattern | AD-F-001 through AD-F-003 | Z-pattern mechanics for Q&A width variation, diagonal sweep as Q/A bridge, Z at fractal scales |
| AD-002 F-Pattern | AD-F-004 through AD-F-006 | F-pattern for progressive narrative, vertical scanning as CRESCENDO signal, headline hierarchy |
| AD-003 Bento Grid | AD-F-007 through AD-F-009 | Grid as ISLANDS encoding, cell-size hierarchy, gap-as-ocean metaphor |
| AD-004 Spiral | AD-F-010 through AD-F-012 | Flat spiral implementation (ANTI-PHYSICAL risk), spiral as confidence gradient, focal point as bedrock |
| AD-005 Choreography | AD-F-013 through AD-F-015 | Axis transition signals, hub-spoke direction changes, transition breathing mechanics |
| AD-006 Compound | AD-F-016+ | Compound axis meta-insight, fractal axis self-similarity, potential 3-way unification |
| Meta | AD-F-MP-001 | The axis meta-pattern (parallel to OD-F-MP-001) |
| Process | AD-F-PR-001 | Research application methodology |
| Forward | AD-F-FL-001+ | Constraints for CD stage |
| Anti-pattern | AD-F-AP-001+ | Axis anti-patterns discovered |

### Finding Registration Protocol

```
WHEN a discovery is made during AD build:
1. IMMEDIATELY assign AD-F-### ID (do NOT defer)
2. Write finding entry in AD-outbound-findings.md with:
   - ID, Finding statement, Source AD exploration, Discovery context
   - Status (APPLIED/PROPOSED)
   - Target stages (CD, Migration)
   - Chain Impact description
   - Validation Evidence
3. Update AD-RESEARCH-GATE.md with research connection
4. Update RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md with application count

OD's LESSON: Deferred finding registration caused the OD-F-005 collision
(two competing definitions across files). IMMEDIATE registration prevents this.
```

### Key Difference from OD: DD-F-012 Consumption

OD's outbound findings documented how DD-F findings were consumed. AD's outbound findings MUST specifically document how DD-F-012 ("density implies axis") was consumed -- this is the GATE finding for AD. The consumption evidence must show:

```
DD-F-012: Density patterns imply axis preferences
  - AD-001: PULSE -> Z-Pattern? [VALIDATED/CHALLENGED with evidence]
  - AD-002: CRESCENDO -> F-Pattern? [VALIDATED/CHALLENGED]
  - AD-003: ISLANDS -> Bento Grid? [VALIDATED/CHALLENGED]
  - AD-004: GEOLOGICAL -> Spiral? [VALIDATED/CHALLENGED]
  - AD-005: WAVE -> Choreography? [VALIDATED/CHALLENGED]
  - AD-006: FRACTAL -> Compound? [VALIDATED/CHALLENGED]

## PROVENANCE NOTICE

These patterns are NOT arbitrary. Each was validated through AD explorations
with visual audit, adversarial review, and [enrichment process]. See

this stage: [AD's meta-discovery] -- [statement about axis relationship
to org-density].

## 9. How AD Reports on Soul

### Soul Discovery Protocol

AD has a SPECIFIC mandate to watch for spatial soul pieces (SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md, lines 279-283):

> "AD (axis exploration) is the next opportunity for potential soul discovery. If axis geometry produces a new perceptual truth about how things LOOK (not how they organize), it could become Soul Piece #6."

### Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | Evidence Required | Impact on Identity |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **No spatial soul piece** | All axis geometry decisions are design choices, not perceptual truths. No axis principle achieves "cannot change without destroying identity" status. | v2 documents the negative finding (parallel to OD's "no cognitive soul piece"). 5 soul pieces remain complete. |
| **Spatial soul piece discovered** | A perceptual truth about reading direction/axis geometry that (a) is a WAY OF SEEING, not a CSS rule, (b) cannot be changed without destroying identity, (c) was DISCOVERED, not decided. | v2 adds Soul Piece #6 to Section 1. SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md updated with Stage 4 determination. |
| **ANTI-PHYSICAL elevated to soul piece** | Enough axis techniques fail the ANTI-PHYSICAL filter to formalize it from observed pattern to prescriptive soul constraint. | ANTI-PHYSICAL becomes Soul Piece #6. Changes from diagnostic to prescriptive. |

### Candidate Spatial Soul Pieces (from analysis)

| Candidate | Likelihood | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| "Axis transitions require explicit visual signals" | MEDIUM | Specific to editorial identity, not generic. Would constrain all future axis work. But may be too specific for soul-piece status. |
| "Reading flow enters top-left and exits bottom-right" | LOW | Too generic -- true of most Western typography. Not a KortAI-specific truth. |
| "Horizontal axis is secondary to vertical axis" | MEDIUM | Consistent with flat/grounded identity. But may just be a consequence of web layout, not a perceptual truth. |
| "ANTI-PHYSICAL as soul piece" | MEDIUM-HIGH | 20/20 SOUL FAILs across OD. If AD produces another 10+ SOUL FAILs in the same pattern, the evidence becomes overwhelming. But it's a META-OBSERVATION about what the soul rejects, not a PERCEPTUAL TRUTH about how things look. |

### Soul Reporting in v2

ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2.md must include a Stage 4 Determination in the identity statement, parallel to the Stage 3 Determination in SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md:

```
## STAGE 4 DETERMINATION

AD explored spatial rhythm -- how the reader's eye physically moves through
content. [Result: no new spatial soul piece / Soul Piece #6 discovered].

[If no soul piece:]
The 5 visual soul pieces remain the complete set. No axis geometry principle
achieved soul-level status. [Explanation of what came closest and why it
didn't qualify.]

The ANTI-PHYSICAL identity was [confirmed / elevated]:
- OD: 20/20 SOUL FAILs
- AD: [N]/[N] SOUL FAILs
- Cumulative: [N]/[N] SOUL FAILs across 2 stages
- Categories: [updated list if new categories from axis techniques]

[If soul piece discovered:]
Soul Piece #6: [Name]
Discovered during: [AD exploration]
Perceptual truth: [The way of seeing]
Locked CSS: [The mechanism]
How to test: [The verification question]
```

### SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md Update

Regardless of outcome, SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md (the provenance copy) must be updated with a Stage 4 Determination section, parallel to the existing Stage 3 Determination.

## 10. Transitive Chain Flow Through Identity

### The Chain at OD Completion

```
Stage 1: COMPONENTS -> 5 soul pieces, 21 COMP-F findings
    |
    v
Stage 2: DD -> 6 density patterns, 18 DD-F findings
    |  DD-F-006: FRACTAL (meta-pattern, all stages)
    |  DD-F-010: Organization must SERVE density
    |  DD-F-012: Density implies axis (AD GATE)
    |  DD-F-013: Component density tolerance (CD GATE)
    v
Stage 3: OD -> 6 org patterns, 17 OD-F findings
    |  OD-F-005: Organization IS Density (CROWN JEWEL)
    |  OD-F-MP-001: Org=Density meta-pattern
    |  OD-F-FL-001: Org implies axis (extends DD-F-012)
    v
Stage 4: AD -> [PENDING]
    |  TRANSITIVE CHAIN: org -> density -> axis
    |  AD validates: does axis SERVE the unified org-density?
    |  AD discovers: is axis a 3rd perspective on SAME phenomenon?
    |  AD forward: AD-F-FL-001 (axis implies combination? for CD)
    v
Stage 5: CD -> [PENDING]
```

### How the Chain Constrains AD

1. **DD-F-012 (Density implies axis):** CRESCENDO implies vertical, ISLANDS implies grid, WAVE implies radial. AD MUST respect these implications.

2. **OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density):** When you choose conversational Q&A, you have chosen PULSE. AD cannot separate org from density.

3. **OD-F-FL-001 (Org implies axis):** Extends DD-F-012 with org-level specificity. CONVERSATIONAL implies vertical-width-variation, NARRATIVE implies single-column-vertical, TASK-BASED implies grid/offset, CONFIDENCE implies layered-horizontal, SPATIAL implies hub-spoke-radial.

4. **Combined constraint:** AD receives org+density+axis as a TRIPLE constraint. Each AD exploration is pre-paired. AD cannot freely choose axes.

### What AD Might Discover About the Chain

| Discovery | Impact on Chain | Impact on Identity |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Axis serves org-density (expected) | Chain validated. Axis is downstream of unified phenomenon. 3 layers, 1 phenomenon. | v2 confirms: "Organization IS density IS axis" |
| Axis is independent dimension | Chain CHALLENGED. Axis adds genuinely new information not predicted by org-density. | v2 documents: "Axis is genuinely independent. 3 layers, 2+ phenomena." |
| Axis partially serves, partially independent | Chain REFINED. Some axis choices are constrained by org-density, others are free creative space. | v2 nuances: "The transitive chain holds for axis DIRECTION but not axis TRANSITION" (or similar) |
| Compound axis = compound org-density (3-way unification) | Chain EXTENDED. AD-006 proves same phenomenon from 3 perspectives. | v2: THE meta-meta-insight. All 3 dimensions collapse into one. |

## 11. EXT-AXIS-* Research Naming Convention

Bespoke research for AD should follow the OD naming pattern:

| AD | Research Prefix | Example |
|----|----------------|---------|
| AD-001 Z-Pattern | EXT-AXIS-Z-### | EXT-AXIS-Z-001 (Z-pattern eye tracking data) |
| AD-002 F-Pattern | EXT-AXIS-F-### | EXT-AXIS-F-001 (F-pattern text-heavy optimization) |
| AD-003 Bento Grid | EXT-AXIS-B-### | EXT-AXIS-B-001 (Bento grid cell sizing research) |
| AD-004 Spiral | EXT-AXIS-S-### | EXT-AXIS-S-001 (Fibonacci spiral flat implementation) |
| AD-005 Choreography | EXT-AXIS-C-### | EXT-AXIS-C-001 (Axis transition visual signals) |
| AD-006 Compound | EXT-AXIS-X-### | EXT-AXIS-X-001 (Compound axis composition theory) |

Alternative naming (simpler, following OD precedent more closely):

| AD | Research Prefix | Parallel OD Prefix |
|----|----------------|-------------------|
| AD-001 | EXT-ZPAT-### | EXT-CONV-### |
| AD-002 | EXT-FPAT-### | EXT-NARR-### |
| AD-003 | EXT-BENT-### | EXT-TASK-### |
| AD-004 | EXT-SPIR-### | EXT-CONF-### |
| AD-005 | EXT-CHOR-### | EXT-SPAT-### |
| AD-006 | EXT-COMP-### | EXT-CREATIVE-### |

Recommendation: Use the first format (EXT-AXIS-Z/F/B/S/C/X) because it preserves the "AXIS" prefix showing which pipeline stage produced them, parallel to how OD used domain-specific prefixes (CONV/NARR/TASK/CONF/SPAT/CREATIVE).

## 12. Identity Continuity Risks

### Risk 1: Forgetting the Transitive Chain
**Symptom:** AD chooses axis geometry based on "what looks good" instead of "what the chain says."
**Prevention:** HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md acknowledgment protocol. Every AD agent must state the chain before building.
**Detection:** Audit question: "Can you trace this axis choice back through density to organization?"

### Risk 2: Finding ID Collision
**Symptom:** Two AD explorations independently assign the same AD-F-### ID.
**Prevention:** Centralized finding registry (AD-RESEARCH-GATE.md). Per-agent ID ranges assigned at spawn.
**Detection:** Cross-reference all AD-F-### IDs at synthesis stage.
**OD Lesson:** OD-F-005 collision was resolved by source priority (OD-CHECKPOINT > builder-log). Establish source priority for AD BEFORE build.

### Risk 3: Semi-Transparent Backgrounds Survive Again
**Symptom:** rgba < 1.0 appears in AD explorations despite the binary rule.
**Prevention:** Binary gate in every agent prompt: "opacity === 1 on ALL visual elements." Dedicated rgba/opacity sweep as mandatory audit gate.
**Detection:** Programmatic search: `grep -c 'rgba\|opacity' AD-*.html`

### Risk 4: v2 Identity Grows Uncontrollably
**Symptom:** v2 balloons to 1000+ lines, losing the "any agent reading ONLY this document" constraint.
**Prevention:** Target 700-800 lines. Compress older DD-F findings into summary tables. Reference outbound findings documents instead of reproducing full finding entries.
**Detection:** Line count check before committing v2.

### Risk 5: Soul Piece #6 Premature Declaration
**Symptom:** A spatial finding is elevated to soul piece status without meeting the perceptual truth criteria.
**Prevention:** Soul piece must be a WAY OF SEEING (not a CSS rule), must be DISCOVERED (not decided), and must be immutable (cannot change without destroying identity). Test: "Would another designer, looking at the same components for long enough, eventually see this truth?"
**Detection:** Two-instance verification: a second, independent agent must ALSO identify the candidate as soul-level.

**Assignment:** Thread OD-001-conversational.html into knowledge web
**Tier:** B (10 sections, ~60 lines)

### Actions Taken

1. **Created Tier B inline section** for OD-001-conversational.html
   - All 10 sections populated: WHY, QUESTION, STATUS, SOUL ALIGNMENT, BUILT ON, MUST HONOR, WHAT BREAKS, CONSUMED BY, RESEARCH DEBT, DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
   - 4 research debt items documented (R1-026 not implemented, no data-finding annotations, domain-specific content only, no PULSE quantification)
   - 5 diagnostic questions covering soul tokens, fractal scales, callout positioning, callout limits, TIDAL width

2. **Updated 3 DD source files' CONSUMED BY tables:**
   - DD-001-breathing.html: Added OD-001 as consumer (PULSE pattern reference)
   - DD-005-rivers.html: Added OD-001 as consumer (TIDAL width variation)
   - DD-006-fractal.html: Added OD-001 as consumer (DD-F-006 fractal at 4 scales)

3. **Updated RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md:**
   - OD-001 row updated with 13 applied findings + 1 declared-not-implemented
   - 8 R1 findings moved UNAPPLIED→APPLIED (R1-001, R1-003, R1-007, R1-008, R1-010, R1-016, R1-018, R1-019)
   - 2 R5 findings moved UNAPPLIED→APPLIED (R5-S1, R5-T4)
   - R3 findings unchanged (R3-003, R3-034, R3-036 already APPLIED from DD stage)
   - Global summary updated: 20 APPLIED (was 10), 317 UNAPPLIED (was 327), rate 5.93% (was 2.97%)
   - Full update log entry with evidence for all 13 findings + anti-pattern checks

4. **Updated OD-CHECKPOINT.md:**
   - OD-001 FILES CREATED row: all three columns checked
   - THREADING STATUS TABLE: inline section, DD sources, RESEARCH-ACTIVE all checked
   - OD-001 status: "THREADING COMPLETE — Awaiting Thread Audit"
   - T1 LOCKED notes expanded with specific pending updates

5. **T1 LOCKED handling:**
   - MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md: NOT modified (T1 LOCKED) — noted in OD-CHECKPOINT.md
   - DESIGN-TOKEN-SUMMARY.md: NOT modified (T1 LOCKED) — noted in OD-CHECKPOINT.md

## OD-003 Threading — 2026-02-07

**Assignment:** Thread OD-003-task-based.html into knowledge web
**Tier:** B (10 sections — already created by builder)

### Actions Taken

1. **Verified Tier B inline section** already exists for OD-003-task-based.html
   - All 10 sections present: WHY, QUESTION, STATUS, SOUL ALIGNMENT, BUILT ON, MUST HONOR, WHAT BREAKS, CONSUMED BY, RESEARCH DEBT, DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
   - 5 research debt items (no quantitative ISLANDS measurement, CI/CD-only content, Chromium-only scroll animations, no JS state tracking, no quantitative BOOKENDS measurement)
   - 8 diagnostic questions covering :root match, fractal scales, island spacing, BOOKENDS visibility, callout positioning, callout limits, square markers, solid offset

2. **Updated 2 DD source files' CONSUMED BY tables:**
   - DD-003-islands.html: Added OD-003 as consumer (primary ISLANDS source — task clusters as discrete islands, validates DD-F-003)
   - DD-006-fractal.html: Added OD-003 as consumer (DD-F-006 fractal at 4 scales: page/section/component/character)

3. **Updated RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md:**

   - No new R1-R5 findings changed status (all were already APPLIED from prior work)
   - Full update log entry with evidence for all findings + anti-pattern checks
   - EXT-TASK series documented (external research outside R1-R5 system)

4. **Updated OD-CHECKPOINT.md:**
   - OD-003 FILES CREATED row: all three columns checked
   - THREADING STATUS TABLE: inline section, DD sources, RESEARCH-ACTIVE all checked
   - OD-003 status: "THREADING COMPLETE — Awaiting Thread Audit"
   - Per-OD snapshot expanded with full detail including EXT-TASK research
   - T1 LOCKED notes expanded to include OD-003

5. **T1 LOCKED handling:**
   - MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md: NOT modified (T1 LOCKED) — noted in OD-CHECKPOINT.md
   - DESIGN-TOKEN-SUMMARY.md: NOT modified (T1 LOCKED) — noted in OD-CHECKPOINT.md

### Threading Completeness Verification

| Direction | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| OD-003 → DD-003 | BIDIRECTIONAL | BUILT ON references DD-003; DD-003 CONSUMERS lists OD-003 |
| OD-003 → DD-006 | BIDIRECTIONAL | BUILT ON references DD-006; DD-006 CONSUMED BY lists OD-003 |
| OD-003 → OD-001 | ONE-WAY (acceptable) | BUILT ON references OD-001; OD-001 does not need OD-003 as consumer |
| OD-003 → OD-002 | ONE-WAY (acceptable) | BUILT ON references OD-002; OD-002 does not need OD-003 as consumer |
| OD-003 → MASTER-SOUL | ONE-WAY (T1 LOCKED) | BUILT ON references; CONSUMED BY update pending |

| OD-003 → RESEARCH-ACTIVE | BIDIRECTIONAL | CONSUMED BY lists RESEARCH-ACTIVE; RESEARCH-ACTIVE updated |
| OD-003 → OD-CHECKPOINT | BIDIRECTIONAL | CONSUMED BY lists OD-CHECKPOINT; OD-CHECKPOINT updated |

**Files Updated:** 6 (DD-003, DD-006, RESEARCH-ACTIVE, OD-CHECKPOINT, weaver-log, OD-003 verified)
**T1 LOCKED Pending:** 2 (MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md, DESIGN-TOKEN-SUMMARY.md)
**Threading Status:** COMPLETE (4/8 bidirectional, 4/8 one-way — 2 T1 LOCKED, 2 acceptable predecessor asymmetry)

### Notable Observations
- OD-003 uses EXT-TASK external research findings (not in R1-R5 system) — this is new for the knowledge web
- DD-003 uses section heading "8. CONSUMERS" instead of "8. CONSUMED BY" like other DD files — format inconsistency but functionally equivalent
- OD-003 has more BUILT ON sources (6) than OD-001 (5) or OD-002 (6) — growing inheritance chain as OD series progresses

## OD-004 + OD-005 Threading — 2026-02-07

**Assignment:** Thread OD-004-confidence.html and OD-005-spatial.html into knowledge web (batch operation)
**Tier:** Both B (10 sections — already created by builders)

### Actions Taken

1. **Verified Tier B inline sections** exist for both OD-004 and OD-005
   - OD-004: 10 sections, 10 diagnostic questions, 5 research debt items, GEOLOGICAL+CRESCENDO density
   - OD-005: 10 sections, 8 diagnostic questions, 4 research debt items, WAVE+ISLANDS density

2. **Updated 5 DD source files' CONSUMED BY tables:**
   - DD-001-breathing.html: Added OD-005 (WAVE reference for hub-spoke oscillation)
   - DD-002-gradient.html: Added OD-004 (secondary CRESCENDO — confidence stratification)
   - DD-003-islands.html: Added OD-005 (secondary ISLANDS — each spoke is content island)
   - DD-004-layers.html: Added OD-004 (primary GEOLOGICAL — confidence-level stratification)
   - DD-006-fractal.html: Added BOTH OD-004 + OD-005 (DD-F-006 fractal at 4 scales each)

3. **Updated RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md:**
   - OD-004 row populated: 10 R-findings (all already APPLIED) + 12 EXT-CONF external
   - OD-005 row populated: 9 R-findings + R3-006 NEW + 10 EXT-SPAT external
   - R3-006 (WAVE) moved UNAPPLIED → APPLIED via OD-005
   - Global totals: 22 APPLIED (was 21), 315 UNAPPLIED (was 316), rate 6.53%
   - Combined update log entry for both ODs
   - FLAGGED: OD-005 header uses wrong finding IDs (R3-005 for WAVE, R3-007 for ISLANDS)

4. **Updated OD-CHECKPOINT.md:**
   - OD-004 + OD-005 FILES CREATED rows: all columns checked
   - THREADING STATUS TABLE: both rows fully checked
   - Per-OD snapshots expanded with full detail

# CURRENT-STATE.md — OD Execution Journal
## Overwritten After Every Major Operation

## 1. WHERE ARE WE?

**Phase:** 2.2 — Organizational Explorations (OD)
**Step:** OD-004 BUILD + OD-005 RESEARCH (parallel) → OD-005 BUILD → OD-006 SYNTHESIS → Visual Audit ALL → ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2
**Current Focus:** Building OD-004 (GEOLOGICAL+CRESCENDO) + Researching OD-005 (Spatial/Map external resources) + Weaver verifying OD-003 threading
**Status:** SESSION 5 — Lead orchestrating, 2 parallel agents launching, Weaver active
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-07T12:30 (session 5, build phase)

## 2. WHAT ARE WE DOING AND WHY?

Session 5 continues the build pipeline with full accumulated context:

1. **OD-004 BUILD** — External research COMPLETE (12 resources, 681 lines in OD-004-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md). Builder agent launching with full accumulated identity + geological confidence model.
2. **OD-005 EXTERNAL RESEARCH** — Spatial/map patterns need external research FIRST. Research agent browsing: info architecture, wayfinding (Kevin Lynch), hub-spoke layouts, concept maps, interactive doc maps.
3. **OD-005 BUILD** — Blocked by #2. Will launch when research completes.
4. **OD-006 EMERGENT** — Blocked by OD-004 + OD-005. Creative research feed exists (12 resources, 976 lines). Must be highest-scoring OD.
5. **VISUAL AUDIT** — Blocked by OD-004 + OD-005. All 5+ ODs audited via Playwright at 1440px + 768px.
6. **ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2** — Blocked by OD-006. Full re-traversal of all inline headers including new OD files.
7. **WEAVER** — Currently verifying OD-003's threading header consistency with OD-001/002.

**Why this approach:** Accumulated identity drives all decisions. External research is filtered through KortAI soul. Inline headers carry inherited wisdom. Rigorous real-time logging.

## 3. WHAT KEY DECISIONS GOT US HERE?

**Sessions 1-2:**
- DEC-001: Sequential ordering OD-001→006
- OD-001 BUILT and THREADED (~35/40, INCLUDE)
- OD-002 BUILT and THREADED (~33/40, INCLUDE)
- OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md PASSED

**Sessions 3-4:**
- DEC-005: Identity-first approach
- DEC-006: External research refined to KortAI identity
- DEC-007: Visual audit MANDATORY
- DEC-008: Inline headers Tier B minimum
- DEC-009: Rigorous execution logging (every step)
- DEC-010: UI audit is INNATE
- DEC-011: Playwright at 1440px + 768px
- DEC-012: Deep visual audit is INNATE
- ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md created (539 lines)
- OD-001 deep audit: 13 screenshots, 5 fixes
- External research: 36 findings (EXT-TASK×12, EXT-CONF×12, EXT-SPAT×12)
- OD-003 BUILT (2291 lines, 5/5 soul, 4-scale fractal)

**Session 5:**
- DEC-013: OD-004 build + OD-005 research in parallel (external research ready for 004, not for 005)
- OD-003 threading header verification assigned to Weaver

## 4. WHAT'S THE CURRENT MENTAL MODEL?

Same core model: KortAI is a design MIND. Inline headers carry inherited wisdom. Each OD naturally serves its paired density pattern.

**OD validation chain so far:**
- OD-001: Conversational → PULSE (validated: Q&A inherently creates sparse/dense alternation)
- OD-002: Narrative → CRESCENDO (validated: story arc naturally builds sparse→dense)
- OD-003: Task-Based → ISLANDS/BOOKENDS (validated: tasks as dense archipelagos in sparse navigation sea)
- OD-004: Confidence → GEOLOGICAL+CRESCENDO (building: certainty strata map to geological layers)
- OD-005: Spatial/Map → WAVE+ISLANDS (researching: hub-spoke with density varying by path)
- OD-006: Creative/Emergent → TBD (waiting: synthesis of all prior patterns)

**Critical accumulation:** Each OD's findings compound. OD-F-001 through OD-F-004 from OD-001. More findings expected from OD-002 through OD-005. OD-006 synthesizes ALL.

## 5. WHAT COMES NEXT AND WHY?

### COMPLETED
1. ✅ ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md (539 lines, 13 source files)
2. ✅ OD-001 COMPLETE + THREADED + AUDITED (~35/40)
3. ✅ OD-002 COMPLETE + THREADED (~33/40)
4. ✅ OD-003 COMPLETE (2291 lines, 5/5 soul) — threading being verified
5. ✅ External research: OD-003 (12), OD-004 (12), OD-006 (12)

### ACTIVE NOW
6. ✅ Weaver verified OD-003 header — CONSISTENT, no fixes
7. ⏳ Weaver threading OD-004 (Task #10) then OD-005 (Task #11)
8. ⏳ OD-006 builder running (Task #8) — emergent synthesis, meta-content
9. ⏳ OD-005 external research agent still running (parallel, non-blocking)

### QUEUE (with dependencies)
10. Visual audit ALL ODs (blocked by OD-006 completion)
11. Update ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2 (blocked by OD-006)
12. Update all documentation (OD-CHECKPOINT, RESEARCH-ACTIVE, OD-SYNTHESIS, HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD)

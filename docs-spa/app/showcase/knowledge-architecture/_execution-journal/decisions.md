# Decisions Log — OD Execution

## 2026-02-07 — DEC-001: Exploration Ordering

**Context:** 6 OD explorations need ordering. PROTO recommends OD-001→006 sequential. Could reorder based on complexity or independence.

**Alternatives:**
1. Sequential OD-001→006 (PROTO recommendation) — compounding identity builds naturally, each informs next
2. Start with OD-003 (task-based, most "practical") — highest immediate utility
3. Start with OD-005 (spatial, highest DD source score) — builds on DD-006's 36/40
4. Parallel OD-001 + OD-003 (independent patterns) — faster but less compounding

**Choice:** Option 1 — Sequential OD-001→006

**Rationale:** Compounding requires serial execution. OD-001 (conversational, PULSE) is the simplest organizational pattern — establishes baseline. OD-006 (creative) must emerge from OD-001-005, so it must be last. Sequential order matches density pairing complexity progression (PULSE→CRESCENDO→ISLANDS→GEOLOGICAL→FRACTAL/custom→emergent).

**Expected Consequence:** Identity v0→v1→v2→v3→v4→v5→v6 will compound. Each OD starts richer. OD-006 has the most context. Tradeoff: slower than parallel, but knowledge quality higher.

**Actual Consequence:** [To be filled after OD-006 completion]

## 2026-02-07T11:16 — DEC-002: OD-001 Build Audit PASS — Proceed Without Rework

**Context:** OD-001 was built by a previous session's Builder. File is 1250 lines with all soul pieces, research applied, tokens correct. Should we rebuild or accept?

**Alternatives:**
1. Accept file as-is and proceed to threading (current state is high quality)
2. Rebuild from scratch with fresh Builder (wastes effort, file is already good)
3. Iterate on existing file to address R1-026 gap (minor fix)

**Choice:** Option 1 — Accept and proceed. Note R1-026 as research debt.

**Rationale:** Auditor BUILD AUDIT returned PASS on all 16 checks. The only advisory (R1-026 collapsible callouts listed but not implemented) is non-blocking — documented as research debt in threading. Rebuilding would waste tokens for marginal improvement.

**Expected Consequence:** OD-001 threading completes. Identity v1 absorbs OD-001's insights. OD-002 starts with richer context.

**Actual Consequence:** [To be filled]

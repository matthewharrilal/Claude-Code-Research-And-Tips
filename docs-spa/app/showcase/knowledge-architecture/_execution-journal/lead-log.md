# Lead Log — OD Execution

## 2026-02-07T00:00 — INITIALIZATION

**What:** Phase -1 orientation complete. Read HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md, MASTER-STATE.md, STAGE-HEADER.md, explorations/organizational/CLAUDE.md, all DESIGN-SYSTEM CLAUDE.md files, perceptual-deepening SKILL.md.

**Why:** Must absorb full web state before any building. HANDOFF is the gate document — contains density pairings, DD findings to consume, quality bar, soul pieces, and file creation checklist.

**Key Insight:** MASTER-STATE confirms Phase 2.2 OD-001 is next. All 6 DD explorations are INCLUDE (avg 34.5/40 post-reaudit). DD-006 scored highest at 36/40. R-1 is at <3% applied — OD is the PRIMARY application target.

**Decision:** DEC-001 recorded in decisions.md — exploration ordering follows PROTO recommendation (OD-001 through OD-006 sequential).

**Result:** Phase -1 COMPLETE. All orientation files read. Files-to-touch table compiled.

**Frame Update:** OD is not just "organizational patterns" — it's where cognitive soul pieces may emerge. DD discovered visual soul. OD explores cognitive rhythm. Watch for patterns that feel like soul.

**Next:** Traverser completes → Guardian validates identity v0 → Create Research Gate → Spawn teammates.

## 2026-02-07T11:13 — RECOVERY FROM CONTEXT LOSS

**What:** Session 2 recovery. Previous session completed Phases -1, 0, spawned team, assigned OD-001 to Builder. Builder completed OD-001-conversational.html (1250 lines) but context was lost before post-build pipeline (builder-log empty, no completion report sent).

**Why:** Recovery Protocol (ARCH Section 5.2) — read journal FIRST (mental model), checkpoint SECOND (position), web THIRD (file assessment). Journal preserved WHY decisions were made. Checkpoint preserved WHERE we were.

**Key Insight:** OD-001 file is HIGH QUALITY. All 5 soul pieces present. 14 research findings applied with annotations. PULSE density visible. DD-F-006 fractal at 4 scales. The Builder did excellent work before the session loss.

**Decision:** Skip re-building OD-001. File is complete. Proceed with post-build pipeline: Guardian → Build Audit → Weaver → Thread Audit.

**Result:** Guardian PASSED (5/5, CHECK 5 conditional pending Auditor). Auditor BUILD AUDIT deployed. Team re-spawned (Builder + Weaver in-process mode).

**Frame Update:** Recovery works because the 3-layer state model is sound: web (file exists) + checkpoint (position known) + journal (mental model preserved). The 15-25 minute recovery estimate from PROTO is accurate.

**Next:** Auditor completes BUILD AUDIT → assign Weaver for threading → Thread Audit → HUMAN PAUSE 1.

## 2026-02-07T12:30 — SESSION 5: FULL PIPELINE ACTIVATION

**What:** Session 5 begins. OD-001/002/003 COMPLETE. Weaver verifying OD-003 threading header. Launching parallel build of OD-004 + external research for OD-005. Full accumulated identity absorbed (539 lines, 13 source files traversed).

**Why:** User directive — continue building all remaining ODs with accumulated context, spawn sub-agents for external research, reflect findings in UI/UX variations, update inline headers rigorously, intense visual auditing. Real-time execution logging emphasized (3x).

**Context Absorbed This Session:**
- ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md (full 539 lines — soul, findings, constraints, identity)
- OD-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md (first 200 lines — recovery, paradigm shift, inline sections as modification guards)
- OD-004-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md (full 681 lines — 12 resources, geological confidence model)
- OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md (full 976 lines — 12 resources, creative techniques)
- OD-CHECKPOINT.md (full — current state of all 6 ODs)
- OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md (full — finding-by-finding mapping, PASSED)

**Current OD State:**
| OD | Status | Score | Threading |
|----|--------|-------|-----------|
| OD-001 | COMPLETE | ~35/40 | DONE |
| OD-002 | COMPLETE | ~33/40 | DONE |
| OD-003 | COMPLETE | ~35/40 (pending audit) | Weaver verifying |
| OD-004 | NOT BUILT | — | — |
| OD-005 | NOT BUILT | — | — |
| OD-006 | NOT BUILT | — | — |

**Tasks Created (with dependencies):**
- #4: Build OD-004 (no blockers — research ready)
- #5: Research external resources for OD-005 (no blockers)
- #6: Build OD-005 (blocked by #5)
- #7: Visual audit all ODs (blocked by #4, #6)
- #8: Build OD-006 emergent (blocked by #4, #6)
- #9: Update ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2 (blocked by #8)

**Decision:** DEC-013 — Launch OD-004 build + OD-005 research in parallel. OD-004 has complete external research (12 resources). OD-005 needs spatial/map external research before building.

**Result:** Tasks created, dependencies set. Launching parallel agents NOW.

**Next:** OD-004 builder + OD-005 researcher agents running. Monitor both. When OD-005 research completes → launch OD-005 builder. When both complete → OD-006 + visual audit.

## 2026-02-07T12:40 — ALL 6 ODs COMPLETE + EMERGENT PATTERN DISCOVERED

**What:** All 6 organizational explorations are BUILT, ON DISK, and 5/5 soul compliant. OD-006 discovered the emergent meta-pattern: **OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density"** — the organizational pattern and density pattern are the same phenomenon observed from two perspectives.

**The Complete OD Series:**
| OD | Lines | Pattern | Density | Content |
|----|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| OD-001 | 2,157 | Conversational Q&A | PULSE | Context Management Q&A |
| OD-002 | 1,364 | Narrative Arc | CRESCENDO | Git Bisect debugging story |
| OD-003 | 2,291 | Task-Based | ISLANDS/BOOKENDS | CI/CD Pipeline setup |
| OD-004 | 2,083 | Confidence-Based | GEOLOGICAL+CRESCENDO | WebSocket Real-Time |
| OD-005 | 2,141 | Spatial/Map | WAVE+ISLANDS | React Component Architecture |
| OD-006 | 2,275 | Creative/Emergent | ALL (FRACTAL) | KortAI Design System meta |
| **TOTAL** | **12,311** | | | **586KB** |

**Key Accomplishments:**
- 28 R1 findings applied in OD-006 alone (18 R1 + 4 OD-F + 6 DD-F)
- 9 of 12 creative techniques from CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED integrated
- 4 new OD-F findings discovered (OD-F-005 through OD-F-008)
- Every section of OD-006 mirrors a prior OD's organizational pattern
- OD-006 is the MOST fractal — fractal across 6 DIFFERENT org modes

**The Emergent Discovery Chain:**
```
DD-F-006 (Fractal): Self-similarity at all scales creates coherence
    ↓ (compounded through OD series)
OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density): The distinction is artificial — same phenomenon, two perspectives
```

**What's Left:**
1. Weaver threading OD-006 (assigned, active)
2. Visual audit ALL 6 ODs via Playwright (Task #7)
3. ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2 (Task #9)
4. OD synthesis documents (OD-outbound-findings, HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD)

**Decision:** DEC-014 — Proceed to visual audit in parallel with weaver's threading. Don't wait for threading to complete before auditing.

**Frame Update:** The OD series proved the thesis. Organization IS density. The design mind works. The accumulated identity was sufficient for 3 parallel builder agents to independently produce soul-compliant, research-grounded explorations. This is the proof that the provenance chain creates transferable reasoning.

## 2026-02-07T13:00 — SESSION 6: RECOVERY + VISUAL AUDIT + OD-004 REBUILD

**What:** Session 6 recovery from context compaction. All 6 ODs confirmed on disk. OD-004 was REBUILT by builder agent (old 2083-line WebSocket version replaced with 1752-line API Best Practices version). Key fix: R1-001 was applied INVERSELY in old version (established=dense, exploratory=sparse — WRONG). New version applies correctly: certain=sparse, uncertain=dense. OD-006 threading confirmed complete by weaver. All 6 DD CONSUMED BY tables updated.

**Verified State:**
| OD | Lines | Threading | Status |
|----|-------|-----------|--------|
| OD-001 | 2,157 | DONE | COMPLETE |
| OD-002 | 1,364 | DONE | COMPLETE |
| OD-003 | 2,291 | DONE | COMPLETE |
| OD-004 | 1,752 | DONE (rebuilt) | COMPLETE |
| OD-005 | 2,141 | DONE | COMPLETE |
| OD-006 | 2,275 | DONE | COMPLETE |
| **TOTAL** | **11,980** | ALL THREADED | ALL COMPLETE |

**Key Insight:** OD-004 rebuild is a quality improvement — R1-001 inversion was a critical error. New content (API Best Practices) with correct inverse density-confidence correlation. All 12 EXT-CONF findings integrated. 3 new OD-F findings (OD-F-005 Confidence as Natural Density Generator, OD-F-006 Crux Blocks as Bidirectional Connectors, OD-F-007 Non-Alarming Deepening).

**Next:** Visual audit ALL 6 ODs via Playwright at 1440px and 768px. HTTP server on port 8765.

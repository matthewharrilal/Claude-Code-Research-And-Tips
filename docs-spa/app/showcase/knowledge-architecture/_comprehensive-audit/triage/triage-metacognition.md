## Summary

This directory contains raw agent output from the 9-agent Workflow Metacognition Analysis. All content has been synthesized into `WORKFLOW-METACOGNITION-ANALYSIS.md` (top-level KA file, 64KB). None of these files are referenced by any rendered HTML/TSX content. The synthesis file contains the key strategic discoveries (binary rule principle, meta-to-output ratio, etc.).

## Per-File Assessment

|------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|---------------|
| INDEX.md | 1.3KB | NO | NO | NO | STALE | DELETE | Just an index of the other 9 files — no unique content |
| workflow-analysis-chronological.md | 43.3KB | NO | YES | NO | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Raw chronological analysis — unique data, synthesized |
| workflow-analysis-context.md | 36.6KB | NO | YES | NO | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Context management analysis — unique data, synthesized |
| workflow-analysis-git.md | 15.2KB | NO | YES | NO | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Git history analysis — unique data, synthesized |
| workflow-analysis-plans.md | 20.6KB | NO | YES | NO | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Plan file analysis — unique data, synthesized |
| workflow-analysis-threading.md | 20.4KB | NO | YES | NO | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Threading analysis — unique data, synthesized |
| workflow-analysis-two-instance.md | 24.5KB | NO | YES | YES | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Two-instance pattern analysis — contains strategic discovery |
| workflow-deep-architecture.md | 40.1KB | NO | YES | YES | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Deep architectural analysis — contains tiered docs insight |
| workflow-deep-blindspots.md | 30.9KB | NO | YES | YES | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Blindspot analysis — unique critical perspective |
| workflow-deep-paradoxes.md | 41.6KB | NO | YES | YES | MEANINGFUL | ARCHIVE | Paradox analysis — contains Prophylactic Paradox discovery |

## Decision Summary

**Rationale:** All content synthesized into WORKFLOW-METACOGNITION-ANALYSIS.md. The raw agent files contain supporting detail and are valuable historical records of the analysis methodology. The deep-* files in particular contain strategic insights (binary rule principle, Prophylactic Paradox, orchestrator trap) that are referenced in MEMORY.md but fully captured in the synthesis. INDEX.md is a simple listing with zero unique content.

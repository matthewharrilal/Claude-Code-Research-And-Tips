**Agent:** scribe-chain

---

## Changes Made

### 1. PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md (DOCUMENT METADATA section)

**File:** `docs-spa/app/showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md`
**Location:** Section F (DOCUMENT METADATA), after OD Re-Enrichment entry
**Change:** Added comprehensive audit stage reference paragraph:
- ~58 agents, 4 pillars (visual/structural/provenance/triage) + fresh-eyes + fix execution
- 58 findings breakdown (5 Critical, 10 High, 17 Medium, 8 Low, 18 Notes) + 7 unique fresh-eyes
- 10 Critical/High fixes applied across 18 files (6 OD, 6 DD, 4 provenance, 1 TSX, 1 CLAUDE.md)
- Soul compliance: 0 violations across ~13,000 elements (3 independent processes)
- Key fixes: rgba() epidemic, R-2 count correction, DD-BACKPORT, inline code font-size
- Verification: 187 programmatic DOM tests + 12 visual screenshots PASS, 0 new soul violations

### 2. STAGE-HEADER.md (Stage 3 OD, Section 4 Quality)

**File:** `docs-spa/app/showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/stage-3-organization-od/STAGE-HEADER.md`
**Location:** After RE-ENRICHMENT subsection, before Section 5 KEY DECISIONS
**Change:** Added "POST-AUDIT QUALITY NOTE" subsection containing:
- Audit scope: ~58 agents, 4 pillars + fresh-eyes + fix execution
- Findings count: 58 + 7 unique fresh-eyes + 90 observations
- OD-specific fixes: rgba opacity, inline code font-size, off-palette backgrounds
- DD-specific fixes: DD-BACKPORT palette alignment + accessibility
- Provenance fixes: R-2 count, EXT registry counts, stale metadata
- Soul compliance confirmation: 0/~13,000 (3 independent processes)
- Verification: 187 DOM tests + 12 screenshots PASS
- Report file references

### 3. DISCOVERIES-LOG.md (Checkpoints)

**File:** `docs-spa/app/showcase/checkpoints/DISCOVERIES-LOG.md`
**Location:** New section inserted between DD explorations and OD explorations
**Change:** Added "COMPREHENSIVE HIERARCHICAL AUDIT LEARNINGS (2026-02-09)" section with 5 key learnings:
1. **rgba() Opacity Epidemic** -- ~102 instances, resolution via opaque replacements, binary rule
2. **Soul Lock Confirmation (0/~13,000)** -- 3 independent processes, strongest evidence in pipeline
3. **DD Pre-Convention Gap** -- DD-BACKPORT pattern as reference model for retroactive convention alignment
4. **Post-Re-Enrichment Metadata Drift** -- Count propagation as systemic risk of multi-wave processes
5. **Fresh-Eyes Methodology Value** -- Convention-awareness creates blind spots, always include fresh-eyes pass

## Verification

- All 3 updates reference "Comprehensive Hierarchical Audit (2026-02-09)" as required
- Data sourced from MASTER-AUDIT-REPORT.md and CAPTAIN-FIX-REPORT.md
- Finding counts, file counts, and fix counts cross-checked against both source documents
- Soul compliance numbers consistent across all updates (0/~13,000, 3 independent processes)

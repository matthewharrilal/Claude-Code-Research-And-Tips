Updated OD Execution Protocol 


I'll create the fully audited, comprehensive OD Execution Protocol v2.0 with all gap analyses resolved and clarifications integrated. Let me produce this as a complete document.

OD ORGANIZATIONAL EXPLORATIONS — COMPREHENSIVE EXECUTION PROTOCOL v2.0
Phase 2.2: Cognitive Organization Patterns Built on: DD Learnings + Perceptual Deepening + 5 Soul Pieces + 337 Research Findings + Phase 2B Navigation Layer + Inline Threading System

If context has been compacted or you are resuming from scratch:
RECOVERY PHASE 1: ORIENTATION (5 min)
READ IN THIS EXACT ORDER:
1. FOLDER-MAP.md (docs-spa/app/showcase/FOLDER-MAP.md)
   → Understand the entire codebase structure at a glance
   → Note which folders are T1 (authoritative) vs T2 (derivative)
   → Find the "Context Recovery" section for current phase state
   
2. showcase/CLAUDE.md
   → Understand what showcase/ is for
   → Get the lab navigation overview
   
3. DESIGN-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md
   → Understand the design system's current state
   → Note the 4 engagement levels
RECOVERY PHASE 2: STATE RESTORATION (5 min)
4. checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md
   → Know EXACTLY where you are (which OD, which iteration, what score)
   → Read the LATEST state snapshot entry (not just the checkbox)
   → Note: "Currently working on" and "Next action"
   
5. checkpoints/OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md
   → Know which research findings are mapped to which OD
   → Know which findings have been applied vs still pending
   
6. checkpoints/MASTER-STATE.md
   → Know overall project position
RECOVERY PHASE 3: CONSTRAINT LOADING (5 min)
7. The INLINE SECTION of your target file
   → Open the file you're about to work on
   → READ THE ENTIRE INLINE SECTION (the comment block at top)
   → Extract: MUST HONOR constraints, BUILT ON sources, WHAT BREAKS warnings
   → Answer the DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS before proceeding
   
8. checkpoints/SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md
   → Reload the 5 soul pieces (possibly more if OD discovered new ones)
   
9. T1 Authority Files (read inline sections only):
   → perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md
   → perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/DESIGN-TOKEN-SUMMARY.md
RECOVERY PHASE 4: SKILL + VISUAL STATE (5 min)
10. The LATEST screenshot for the current OD
    → audit-screenshots/od-explorations/OD-[###]-iteration-[#].png
    → LOOK at it. Know the visual state.
    
11. This protocol document
    → Re-read from the current phase onward
    
12. /mnt/skills/perceptual-deepening/SKILL.md
    → Re-invoke the skill. Extract sub-agents fresh.
THEN: Resume at the exact point indicated by OD-CHECKPOINT.md
DO NOT start building until all 12 steps are complete. DO NOT rely on memory. Read from files. DO NOT skip reading inline sections — they contain constraints that WILL break things if violated.

██ SECTION 0: THE PARADIGM SHIFT — INLINE SECTIONS AS MODIFICATION GUARDS   ██
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
What Changed After Phase 2B
Phase 2B added inline threading sections to 253 files. These sections are NOT documentation. They are MODIFICATION GUARDS — safety systems that prevent you from breaking things you don't understand.
The Old Way (Pre-Phase 2B):
1. Read checkpoint files
2. Build exploration
3. Hope you didn't break anything
The New Way (Post-Phase 2B):
1. Read FOLDER-MAP.md for orientation
2. For EVERY file you will touch:
   - Open the file
   - Read the INLINE SECTION FIRST
   - Note "Must Honor" constraints
   - Note "What Breaks If Changed"
   - Answer Diagnostic Questions
3. Build exploration with constraints ACTIVE
4. Create inline sections for files you CREATE
5. Update inline sections of source files you CONSUME (CONSUMED BY tables)
The Inline Section Structure
Every significant file now has this structure at the top:

Critical Mindset Shift
Old Thinking
New Thinking
"I'll read the research files"
"I'll read the INLINE SECTION of each file FIRST"
"The constraint is documented somewhere"
"The constraint is in the MUST HONOR table of the file I'm touching"
"What might this affect?"
"The WHAT BREAKS section tells me exactly what depends on this"
"I think this file is authoritative"
"The STATUS line tells me if this is LOCKED or superseded"
"I need to trace the provenance"
"The BUILT ON table shows me exactly what this consumes"
"I shouldn't create new files"
"I SHOULD create new files — but with inline sections and threading"

What DD Answered vs What OD Must Answer
DD asked: "How should information FEEL visually?"
	•	DD discovered density RHYTHMS: breathing, gradient, islands, layers, rivers, fractal
	•	DD validated that rhythm applies at ALL scales (fractal principle from DD-006)
	•	DD established the visual vocabulary we now BUILD ON
	•	DD's inline sections now document these discoveries with full provenance
OD asks: "How should information UNFOLD MENTALLY?"
	•	Not visual density — COGNITIVE organization
	•	Not pixel spacing — NARRATIVE structure
	•	Not layout geometry — CONCEPTUAL flow
	•	How the READER'S MIND moves through documentation
	•	OD must READ DD's inline sections to understand the constraints
	•	OD will CREATE new files with inline sections for AD/CD to consume
Why OD Comes After DD and Before AD
DD before OD because:
	•	You need visual rhythm vocabulary before you can structure cognitive flow
	•	DD-006's fractal principle (rhythm at all scales) directly informs OD
	•	DD's CRESCENDO (sparse→dense) maps to OD's Confidence-Based (certain→uncertain)
	•	DD's breathing patterns inform how OD structures expand and contract
	•	DD's inline sections contain the "MUST HONOR" constraints that OD inherits
OD before AD because:
	•	Organization defines WHAT content goes where conceptually
	•	Axis (AD) defines WHERE content goes spatially
	•	You can't decide layout geometry until you know how content is organized
	•	OD-005 (Spatial/Map) might require AD-003 (Bento Grid) — discover the need in OD
	•	OD's inline sections will become MANDATORY inputs for AD

Per-OD Deep Briefs
OD-001: Conversational Structure
Hypothesis: What if documentation was a DIALOGUE?
	•	Reader asks questions, documentation responds
	•	Components play roles: Essence = wise elder's aside, Gotcha = "watch out!", Tip = friendly colleague, Challenge = "try this yourself"
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTION FIRST):
	•	DD-005 Rivers — questions WIDEN the river (sparse), answers NARROW it (dense)
	•	MANDATORY: Read showcase/explorations/density/DD-005-*.html inline section
	•	Extract: MUST HONOR constraints from DD-005
Research:
	•	R-1 (documentation patterns that use Q&A)
	•	R-5 (component voices in dialogue)
Density pattern to use: PULSE (question=sparse, answer=dense, question=sparse)
Will create: explorations/organizational/OD-001-conversational.html WITH inline section
OD-002: Narrative Arc
Hypothesis: What if technical content told a STORY?
	•	Setup (context) → Rising Action (complexity) → Climax (the hard part) → Resolution (clarity)
	•	Components map: Info=exposition, Code=action, Gotcha=plot twist, Essence=theme statement
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTIONS FIRST):
	•	DD-001 Breathing — narrative tension mirrors breathing rhythm
	•	DD-002 CRESCENDO — complexity builds like a crescendo
	•	MANDATORY: Read inline sections of both DD-001 and DD-002 files
	•	Extract: MUST HONOR constraints from both
Research:
	•	R-1 (narrative documentation)
	•	R-2 (editorial layouts that tell stories)
Density pattern: CRESCENDO (sparse setup → dense climax → resolved ending)
Will create: explorations/organizational/OD-002-narrative.html WITH inline section
OD-003: Task-Based
Hypothesis: What if organization followed "I want to..."?
	•	Goal-oriented: user has a TASK, documentation serves that task
	•	Components map: Task=the goal, Code=the steps, Gotcha=the pitfalls, Challenge=stretch goals
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTION FIRST):
	•	DD-003 Islands — tasks are CLUSTERS of related information
	•	MANDATORY: Read showcase/explorations/density/DD-003-*.html inline section
	•	Extract: MUST HONOR constraints from DD-003
Research:
	•	R-1 (task-based documentation)
	•	R-5 (component sequencing for tasks)
Density pattern: BOOKENDS (dense task header → sparse explanation → dense verification)
Will create: explorations/organizational/OD-003-taskbased.html WITH inline section
OD-004: Confidence-Based
Hypothesis: What if information flowed from CERTAIN to UNCERTAIN?
	•	Start with what's definitely true, progress to nuance, end with edge cases
	•	Components map: Essence=axioms (most certain), Info=established, Tip=recommendations, Gotcha=exceptions, Challenge=open questions
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTIONS FIRST):
	•	DD-002 CRESCENDO — certainty→uncertainty mirrors sparse→dense
	•	DD-004 Geological — layers of certainty like geological strata
	•	MANDATORY: Read inline sections of both DD-002 and DD-004 files
	•	Extract: MUST HONOR constraints from both
Research:
	•	R-3 (cognitive density)
	•	R-1 (progressive disclosure patterns)
Density pattern: CRESCENDO (sparse certainty → dense uncertainty)
Will create: explorations/organizational/OD-004-confidence.html WITH inline section
OD-005: Spatial/Map
Hypothesis: What if documentation was a MAP you navigate?
	•	Hub-and-spoke: central concept with branching paths
	•	Non-linear: reader CHOOSES direction, not forced scroll
	•	Components map: CoreAbstraction=hub, Decision=crossroads, File Tree=map legend
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTION FIRST):
	•	DD-006 Fractal — map at every zoom level
	•	MANDATORY: Read showcase/explorations/density/DD-006-*.html inline section
	•	Extract: This is the HIGHEST SCORING DD (36/40) — its constraints are elevated
Research:
	•	R-2 (creative layouts)
	•	R-4 (bento/spatial patterns)
	•	R-5 (hub-spoke combinations)
Density pattern: WAVE (density varies by path chosen)
Will create: explorations/organizational/OD-005-spatial.html WITH inline section
OD-006: Creative Slot
	•	Whatever EMERGES from building OD-001 through OD-005
	•	Might combine multiple organizational strategies
	•	Might discover an entirely new paradigm
	•	Let the work teach you what's missing
	•	Must honor ALL constraints accumulated from OD-001 through OD-005
Will create: explorations/organizational/OD-006-[name].html WITH inline section

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
Research findings are NOT markdown files to check off. They are FUEL. They must:
	0.	Be MAPPED before building (not vaguely "referenced")
	0.	Be APPLIED with evidence during building (not assumed)
	0.	Be VERIFIED after building (not forgotten)
	0.	GENERATE NEW FINDINGS that feed future phases (not dead-end)
	0.	Be STORED in the design system so AD/CD can consume them (not lost)
	0.	Be TRACEABLE through inline sections (not scattered)

THE KEY PRINCIPLE: RESEARCH IS BIDIRECTIONAL
Research doesn't just flow IN to OD. OD generates NEW research that flows OUT:
Inbound: R-1 findings about documentation patterns → inform how OD-001 structures conversation
	•	Read the inline section of each R-1 finding before using it
	•	Note the "MUST HONOR" constraints
Outbound: OD-001 discovers that "questions need 2x the whitespace of answers" → NEW finding that:
	•	Gets stored in organizational-patterns.md (for the design system)
	•	Gets ADDED to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md (for tracking) — NOT a separate file
	•	Gets flagged as INPUT to AD (axis must accommodate question spacing)
	•	Gets flagged as INPUT to CD (component combinations must respect this rhythm)
	•	Gets referenced in the OD-001 inline section's RESEARCH DEBT or CONSUMED BY
	•	Updates the "CONSUMED BY" table in source files
Nothing discovered is a dead end. Everything feeds forward. The inline sections make this traceable.
THE COMPOUNDING LOOP (From README Part V)

OD IS FERTILE GROUND FOR SOUL DISCOVERY
DD discovered 5 soul pieces about VISUAL truth:
	•	Sharp edges, serif wisdom, family DNA, honest flatness, square exactness
OD explores COGNITIVE truth. New soul pieces are EXPECTED here.
Potential OD soul pieces might sound like:
	•	"Questions Need Air" — reader questions require sparse breathing room
	•	"Certainty Compresses" — the more certain, the more concise
	•	"Stories Need Turning Points" — narrative organization requires a moment of surprise
	•	"Tasks Are Islands" — goal-oriented content clusters naturally
These are hypothetical examples. The REAL soul pieces emerge from the work.
DURING EVERY ITERATION, ASK:
"WHY does this organizational flow FEEL right or wrong?"

If you can answer that with a perceptual truth that applies broadly,
you have found a new soul piece.

Sub-Agent E (Soul Documenter) is not optional for OD.
It is where OD's unique contribution to the soul emerges.

DOCUMENT every potential soul piece immediately.
Don't wait for the end. ADD it to SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md
the moment you feel it.

AND: Add it to the inline section of the exploration file
under "4. SOUL ALIGNMENT" with "CANDIDATE SOUL PIECE" marker.

██ SECTION 6: THE PROTOCOL — HOW TO BUILD EACH OD                           ██
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Lesson from DD: Audit DURING, Not After
DD approach (what we did):
Built → Scored → Discovered broken → Audited → Fixed → Re-audited
OD approach (what we do now):
Read inline sections → Invoke skill FIRST → Load ALL context → 
Build WITH sub-agents → Audit DURING every iteration → 
Verify at end → Create inline sections → Update source files → Interweave upward
The perceptual-deepening skill is the BUILD METHODOLOGY, not a post-hoc check. The inline sections are the CONSTRAINT SYSTEM, not post-hoc documentation.

### Gate Status: [PASSED — all findings mapped + inline sections read / NOT PASSED — gaps remain]
THIS FILE IS THE GATE.
	•	If it doesn't exist → you haven't passed the gate → don't build
	•	If it exists but is vague ("applied R-1") → you haven't passed → be specific
	•	If it doesn't include inline section verification → you haven't passed → read them
	•	If it exists with specific finding IDs, implementation plans, evidence criteria, AND inline section constraints → PASS
□ CHECKPOINT: Research Gate PASSED — OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md created with specifics AND inline sections verified

| FRACTAL | DD-006 | Self-similarity at scales | ALL ODs: structure at every level | [from DD-006 inline] |

### DD Quality Standards (OD Must Match)
- All 6 DDs achieved INCLUDE (≥32/40)
- Average: 34.5/40
- Soul compliance: 100%
- OD must meet this bar

### DD "WHAT BREAKS" Warnings (From DD Inline Sections)

███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THIS PHASE DOES NOT EXIST IN THE OLD PROTOCOL. IT IS MANDATORY FOR ALL POST-PHASE-2B WORK.
Purpose
Before building ANY OD exploration, you must read the inline sections of all files you will consume. This is not optional. The inline sections contain constraints that WILL break things if violated.
0.5.1 For Every File You Will CONSUME
For OD-001, you will consume DD-005, DD-006, and various R-1 findings. For each:
## INLINE SECTION PRE-FLIGHT: [Filename]

### File: [path]
### Read: [timestamp]

### 1. STATUS
[ACTIVE/SUPERSEDED] | [LOCKED/EDITABLE]
If LOCKED: STOP. You cannot modify this file without Phase-level approval.

### 2. MUST HONOR (Copy verbatim from inline section)
| Constraint | Source | Consequence of Violation |
|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| [constraint 1] | [source] | [consequence] |
| [constraint 2] | [source] | [consequence] |

### 3. WHAT BREAKS IF CHANGED (Copy key items from inline section)
- [file/system 1] — [how it breaks]
- [file/system 2] — [how it breaks]

### 4. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS (Answer before proceeding)
Q1: [question from inline section]
A1: [your answer]

Q2: [question from inline section]
A2: [your answer]

### 5. DECISION
□ I understand the constraints and will honor them
□ I understand what breaks if I violate these constraints
□ I have answered all diagnostic questions
□ CLEARED TO PROCEED

Did any organizational concept FAIL because a COMPONENT doesn't support it?
Example: "The conversational flow breaks because CodeBlock has no way to visually signal 'pause' — it's always the same density. The component needs a 'sparse mode' or 'breathing mode' for organizational context."
If YES:
	•	Document in OD-CHECKPOINT.md → Downward Trace Log
	•	DO NOT just work around it
	•	The component gap is a FINDING that feeds back to the design system
	•	Note for inclusion in OD exploration's inline section under "RESEARCH DEBT"
	•	DO NOT create a separate COMPONENT-GAPS.md file

	•	Tag it: applies to AD? CD? Both?
	•	This finding is NOT lost — it feeds forward
	•	Note for inclusion in OD exploration's inline section under "CONSUMED BY" (consumers will be AD/CD)

7. WHAT BREAKS IF THIS CHANGES
- **organizational-patterns.md** — [PATTERN NAME] pattern definition references this
  exploration as source. Pattern description would become inaccurate.
- **AD-[###] (future)** — Will consume this organizational pattern for axis geometry.
  Changes here propagate to axis decisions.
- **CD-[###] (future)** — Will consume this organizational flow for combinations.
- **Migration: [type] pages** — Migration will use this pattern.
- **Blast radius:** organizational-patterns.md, AD-[###], CD-[###], migration (4+ consumers)

8. CONSUMED BY
| Consumer | How It Uses This File |
|----------|----------------------|
| organizational-patterns.md | Extracts [PATTERN NAME] definition, components, density pairing |
| AD-[###] (future) | Will consume organizational flow for axis geometry |
| CD-[###] (future) | Will consume component sequence for combination rules |
| OD-SYNTHESIS.md | References as source for pattern validation |

9. RESEARCH DEBT
- [Any findings that were PARTIALLY applied — be specific]
- [Any component gaps discovered — be specific]
- [Any questions that forward to AD — be specific]
- [Any untested assumptions — be specific]
[If no debt: "None identified. All findings validated."]

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
Q1: Does the [ORGANIZATIONAL CONCEPT] feel natural, or forced/artificial?
Q2: Would a reader understand the organizing principle without explanation?
Q3: Does the density pattern SERVE the organization, or fight it?
Q4: Can you follow the cognitive flow when you squint at the page?
Q5: [Question specific to this organizational concept]

3.4 CREATE: DESIGN-SYSTEM/patterns/organizational-patterns.md (WITH INLINE SECTION)
OD's unique design system contribution. This file is CONSUMED by AD and CD. This file MUST have a Tier A inline section — it will be consumed by ALL future work.
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     INLINE THREADING HEADER — Phase 2B
     File: docs-spa/app/showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/patterns/organizational-patterns.md
     Tier: A | Batch: OD | Generated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. WHY THIS EXISTS
This file catalogs the 6 validated organizational patterns discovered during
OD Phase (Phase 2.2). It defines HOW information should UNFOLD MENTALLY in
KortAI documentation. These patterns are the cognitive complement to DD's
density patterns — DD defines visual rhythm, OD defines cognitive flow.
This is the authoritative source for organizational pattern selection.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
"How should documentation be organized to serve different content types
and reader goals?"

3. STATUS
ACTIVE | LOCKED after OD completion | [line count, size]
Modification requires OD phase re-approval or AD/CD phase evidence.

4. SOUL ALIGNMENT
All 6 patterns were validated against the 5 soul pieces:
- SP#1-5: 100% compliance across all patterns
- [Any new cognitive soul pieces discovered during OD]

5. BUILT ON

6. MUST HONOR
| Constraint | Source | Consequence of Violation |
|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Density pairing is FIXED | OD exploration results | Using wrong density for org pattern breaks rhythm |
| Fractal self-similarity | DD-006 | Pattern must work at page/section/component scales |
| Soul pieces in all patterns | MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md | Visual identity violated |
| Pattern selection determines AD axis | OD-AD relationship | Wrong pattern = wrong axis geometry |

7. WHAT BREAKS IF THIS CHANGES
- **AD-001 through AD-006** — Choose organizational pattern BEFORE axis geometry.
  Changes to pattern definitions change axis constraints.
- **CD-001 through CD-006** — Respect organizational flow when combining.
  Changes to pattern definitions change combination rules.
- **Migration pipeline** — Classify existing docs by organizational pattern.
  Changes here change migration classification.
- **Blast radius:** All AD work, all CD work, all migration work (entire future pipeline)

8. CONSUMED BY
| Consumer | How It Uses This File |
|----------|----------------------|
| AD-### explorations | Choose org pattern before axis geometry |
| CD-### explorations | Respect org flow in combinations |
| Migration pipeline | Classify docs by pattern |
| Documentation authors | Select pattern for new docs |

9. RESEARCH DEBT
[Any patterns that need more validation]
[Any edge cases not covered]
[Questions forwarded to AD]

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
Q1: Is the pattern selection guide complete for all content types?
Q2: Are all density pairings validated experimentally, not assumed?
Q3: Do all patterns have specific component role mappings?
Q4: Would a documentation author know which pattern to choose?
Q5: Are the DD constraints from each source pattern reflected?

██ EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS — NON-NEGOTIABLE                                  ██
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
	0.	ORIENT FIRST (Phase -1). Read FOLDER-MAP.md. Read relevant CLAUDE.md files. Know where you are before touching anything. Know what you will CREATE.
	0.	INVOKE /perceptual-deepening FIRST (Phase 0). Before any code. Read it. Extract sub-agents. The skill is PERCEPTUAL TECHNIQUES, not a form.
	0.	READ INLINE SECTIONS BEFORE TOUCHING FILES (Phase 0.5). Every file you consume has an inline section. Read it. Extract constraints. Answer diagnostic questions. Plan the inline sections you will CREATE.
	0.	PASS THE RESEARCH GATE. Create OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md with specific finding-by-finding mapping + DD inline constraint verification BEFORE building. This is a DELIVERABLE.
	0.	SUB-AGENTS = LOOKING, NOT FILLING. When the skill says squint, SQUINT. When it says point to the worst area, POINT. Specific observations. Not "looks good."
	0.	CHECK DD INLINE CONSTRAINTS EVERY ITERATION. The inline sections contain "MUST HONOR" tables. Check them. Every iteration. 0 violations required for INCLUDE.
	0.	CHECKPOINT = STATE SNAPSHOTS. Every iteration: score, key issue, hypothesis, next action, screenshot path, DD constraint status, files created. A fresh Claude can resume from the checkpoint alone (15-25 min recovery).
	0.	RESEARCH FLOWS TO CANONICAL LOCATIONS. New findings → RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md. New soul pieces → SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md. Component gaps → inline section RESEARCH DEBT. DO NOT create OD-FINDINGS.md, OD-SOUL-PIECES.md, COMPONENT-GAPS.md. The canonical locations exist. Use them.
	0.	5 SOUL PIECES EVERY ITERATION + SEEK NEW ONES. DD found visual truths. OD explores cognitive territory. New soul pieces are EXPECTED. ADD them to SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md immediately.
	0.	DD LESSONS ARE INPUTS. DD density patterns feed OD. DD-006 fractal principle applies everywhere. DD quality bar (34.5) must be met. DD inline sections are the authoritative source.
	0.	MINIMUM 3 ITERATIONS. Convergence requires evidence, not assumption.
	0.	CREATE INLINE SECTIONS FOR ALL NEW FILES. Every OD exploration file gets a Tier B inline section. organizational-patterns.md gets a Tier A inline section. OD-SYNTHESIS.md gets a Tier C inline section. New files STRENGTHEN the web by having inline sections.
	0.	UPDATE BIDIRECTIONAL THREADING. When you create a file, update source files' CONSUMED BY. The web must KNOW about new files. Orphan files fragment the web.
	0.	INTERWEAVE UPWARD. organizational-patterns.md is OD's unique contribution. AD and CD CONSUME it via its inline section. It MUST exist with a complete inline section.
	0.	SURVIVE COMPACTION. If context is lost, the Recovery Protocol (15-25 min) + the state snapshots in OD-CHECKPOINT.md + the inline sections of target files should be sufficient to resume at full quality.

Sub-Agent Prompt Template (Context-Rich)
THE PHILOSOPHY: Accumulated context matters.
Sub-agents search with the IDENTITY built from traversing inline sections. Without this context, searches are generic and results can't integrate.
You are a [TYPE] research agent for the KORTAI design system.

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION
[Specific mission — validate, extend, or fill gap]

## 📦 CONTEXT I CARRY (Accumulated from Inline Section Traversal)

**My Current Understanding:**
- [What I know from DD inline sections]
- [What I know from OD iterations so far]
- [What soul pieces constrain]
- [What specific finding I'm investigating]

**Constraints Active (From Inline MUST HONOR Tables):**
- [Constraint 1] — from [source]
- [Constraint 2] — from [source]
- [Constraint 3] — from [source]

**What I'm Uncertain About:**
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

## 🔍 YOUR TASK
[Specific search/research task with context]

## 📤 OUTPUT FORMAT
| External Source | Finding | Relationship to Internal | Confidence Impact | Integration |
|-----------------|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Author, Year] | [finding] | VALIDATES/CHALLENGES/EXTENDS | +X% or -X% | [how to integrate] |

## 🔗 INTEGRATION PATH

**If finding VALIDATES:**
- ID: EXTERNAL-V-### 
- ADD to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md under "External Findings"
- Update internal finding's confidence
- Note in relevant OD inline section's BUILT ON

**If finding CHALLENGES:**
- ID: EXTERNAL-V-### with CHALLENGES flag
- ADD to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md under "Challenged Findings"
- Add to relevant inline section's RESEARCH DEBT
- Reassess hypothesis before continuing

**If finding EXTENDS:**
- ID: EXTERNAL-E-###
- ADD to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md under "External Extensions"
- Evaluate: Does this apply to AD? CD?
- Consider for current OD or flag for future phase

## ⛔ DO NOT
- Return generic articles without connection to our context
- Return findings that can't be integrated
- Skip the integration path — every finding must have a home in RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
- Create separate files for external findings

███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Growth Principle
Research GROWS. Findings EMERGE. New files are EXPECTED.
The goal is NOT to prevent file creation. The goal is to ensure every new file:
	0.	Has an inline section — so it can be consumed by future phases
	0.	Updates source files — so the web knows about it (CONSUMED BY updates)
	0.	Lives in the right location — so it's findable and doesn't duplicate
	0.	Is threaded bidirectionally — BUILT ON points backward, sources point forward
A new file that follows these rules STRENGTHENS the web. A new file that ignores these rules FRAGMENTS the web.

Anti-Patterns: What NOT To Do
Anti-Pattern
Why It's Wrong
Correct Approach
Create `OD-F

























You're right to push on this. Let me be brutally honest:
Gap Analysis — What's Missing
1. File Placement Knowledge: PARTIALLY MISSING
What the protocol DOES have:
	•	Says to read FOLDER-MAP.md
	•	Specifies some exact paths (organizational-patterns.md goes in DESIGN-SYSTEM/patterns/)
	•	Says to update FOLDER-MAP.md if new folders created
What the protocol is MISSING:
	•	No explicit "File Placement Guide" that says WHERE different types of new content go
	•	No anti-sprawl rules ("if you're tempted to create a tracking file, STOP — use the manifest")
	•	No decision framework for "should this be a new file or added to existing file?"
	•	No list of LOCKED DECISIONS about file organization that we established during Phase 2B
	•	Doesn't explain that new OD findings should go in RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md, not create OD-FINDINGS.md
	•	Doesn't explain that the manifest is the SINGLE source of truth for tracking
Verdict: An executor following this protocol MIGHT create file sprawl because I didn't embed the consolidation principles we established.

2. Inline Section Structure & Bidirectional Updates: INCOMPLETE
What the protocol DOES have:
	•	Mentions Tier A/B/C
	•	Shows a rough template in Section D
	•	Has Section E about bidirectional updates
	•	Has a checklist for "inline sections created"
What the protocol is MISSING:
	•	No EXACT field-by-field specification — what EXACTLY goes in "BUILT ON"? What's the table format?
	•	No concrete examples of a properly filled inline section (should show: "here's what OD-001's inline section looks like when complete")
	•	No specification of the MUST HONOR table structure (columns, what constitutes a "consequence")
	•	No specification of the CONSUMED BY table structure
	•	No rules for WHEN to use each tier — I say "OD explorations = Tier B" but not WHY or how to decide
	•	Doesn't show the exact threading header comment format that Phase 2B established
Verdict: An executor would know THAT they need inline sections but not EXACTLY how to construct them to match the Phase 2B standard. They might create inconsistent formats.

3. Sub-Agent Paradigm with Accumulated Context: SIGNIFICANTLY WEAK
What the protocol DOES have:
	•	Appendix B mentions sub-agent types
	•	A brief template with "CONTEXT YOU CARRY"
	•	Mentions the compounding loop in research flow
What the protocol is MISSING:
	•	No explanation of WHY accumulated context matters — the philosophy
	•	No demonstration of context extraction — how do you ACTUALLY pull constraints from 6 DD inline sections and compile them into a sub-agent prompt?
	•	No contrast between generic vs context-rich search — doesn't show the anti-pattern
	•	No integration protocol — when external finding comes back, how EXACTLY does it get an inline section? How does it link back?
	•	Doesn't explain the compounding loop viscerally — "each pass adds more context" is mentioned but not operationalized
	•	Doesn't show what "research never stops growing" means in practice
Verdict: An executor reading this would NOT understand that the sub-agent paradigm is about carrying accumulated identity into external exploration. They might just do generic searches.

What Needs to Be Added
Let me add the missing sections to make this complete:

LOCKED DECISIONS (Do Not Re-Litigate):
Decision
Why
If Tempted To...
Single manifest for tracking
Multiple tracking files create sync nightmares
Create OD-TRACKING.md → STOP. Use RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
Findings go in RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
Centralized tracking enables cross-phase analysis
Create OD-FINDINGS.md → STOP. Add to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
Patterns go in patterns/*.md
Design system has defined structure
Create OD-PATTERNS.md in checkpoints/ → STOP. Use DESIGN-SYSTEM/patterns/
Explorations go in explorations/[phase]/
Organized by phase
Put OD exploration in root → STOP. Use explorations/organizational/
Checkpoints stay minimal
Checkpoints are operational state, not permanent docs
Create elaborate checkpoint files → STOP. State snapshots only

The "Should I Create a New File?" Test
Before creating ANY new file, ask:
	0.	Does a canonical location already exist for this content type? → Add to existing file
	0.	Would this file duplicate information tracked elsewhere? → Don't create it
	0.	Is this operational state or permanent documentation? → If operational, it's a checkpoint addition
	0.	Will AD/CD need to consume this? → If yes, put it where they'll look (inline sections, RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md)
	0.	Am I creating this because it's convenient right now? → That's how sprawl starts. Find the right home.
If you MUST create a new file:
	•	It MUST have an inline section (if it's significant enough to create, it's significant enough to thread)
	•	It MUST be added to FOLDER-MAP.md
	•	It MUST be added to the relevant CLAUDE.md file's listing
	•	Ask: "Will a fresh Claude know where to find this?" If no, reconsider location.

1. WHY THIS EXISTS
This exploration tests the Conversational Structure hypothesis: documentation
as Q&A dialogue between reader and guide. It pairs PULSE density (rhythmic
high-low-high from DD-001) with conversational flow, where questions create
sparse breathing room and answers provide dense information. Scored 35/40
across 4 iterations, validating that dialogue-structured documentation
improves comprehension for explanatory content.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
"How should documentation be organized when the goal is explanation through
dialogue between reader questions and guide answers?"

3. STATUS
ACTIVE | LOCKED | 847 lines, 32KB
Locked after INCLUDE decision. Modification requires OD phase re-approval.

4. SOUL ALIGNMENT
- SP#1 Sharp Edges: All callout containers use border-radius: 0. Question
  blocks and answer blocks both sharp. No rounded corners anywhere.
- SP#2 Archivist Serif: Essence callouts (guide's wisdom asides) use
  Cormorant Garamond italic. Reader questions use sans-serif (Inter) to
  differentiate voice.
- SP#3 Callout Family DNA: All callouts maintain 2-zone structure (label +
  body). Question callouts: "Reader asks:" label. Answer callouts: no label
  (implied). Gotcha/Tip maintain family structure.
- SP#4 No Shadows: Zero box-shadow throughout. Depth conveyed through
  spacing and typography weight, not artificial shadow.
- SP#5 Squares: Step indicators in code walkthrough use square bullets.
  Progress markers are square.

6. MUST HONOR
| Constraint | Source | Consequence of Violation |
|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Questions must create sparse space (≥2x whitespace of answers) | DD-005 Tidal inline section | Conversational rhythm collapses into uniform density |
| PULSE rhythm at all scales | DD-001 inline section + DD-006 fractal | Page rhythm, section rhythm, paragraph rhythm must all pulse |
| Voice differentiation via typography | R5-004 | Reader and guide become indistinguishable, dialogue collapses |
| 5 soul pieces in every element | MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md | Visual identity violation, fails soul compliance |

7. WHAT BREAKS IF THIS CHANGES
- **organizational-patterns.md** — CONVERSATIONAL pattern definition references this
  as source. Pattern description would become inaccurate.
- **AD-001 (future)** — Will consume conversational org pattern for axis geometry.
  Changes here propagate to axis decisions.
- **CD-001 (future)** — Will consume conversational flow for component combinations.
- **Migration: FAQ pages** — FAQ migration will use this pattern. Changes affect
  migration approach.
- **Blast radius:** organizational-patterns.md, AD-001, CD-001, FAQ migration (4 files/phases)

8. CONSUMED BY
| Consumer | How It Uses This File |
|----------|----------------------|
| organizational-patterns.md | Extracts CONVERSATIONAL pattern definition, components, density pairing |
| AD-001 (future) | Will consume organizational flow to determine axis geometry |
| CD-001 (future) | Will consume component sequence for combination rules |
| OD-SYNTHESIS.md | References as source for conversational pattern validation |

9. RESEARCH DEBT
- R1-007 applied but sample size was small (23% figure from single study)
- Voice differentiation tested only with Essence component, not all callout types
- Mobile viewport not tested — PULSE rhythm may need adjustment
- Question: Does conversational structure work for technical reference? (forwards to AD)

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
Q1: Does the Q&A rhythm feel natural, or does it feel forced/artificial?
Q2: Can you distinguish reader voice from guide voice without reading labels?
Q3: Does the PULSE rhythm persist when you squint at the page?
Q4: Would a reader understand they're in a dialogue without explicit framing?
Q5: Do the sparse question zones actually provide cognitive breathing room?

Bidirectional Update Protocol
When you CREATE an inline section, you must ALSO update source files.
After completing OD-001:
Source File
Update Its CONSUMED BY Table
Add This Entry
DD-005-tidal.html
Section 8
`OD-001
DD-006-fractal.html
Section 8
`OD-001
DD-001-pulse.html
Section 8
`OD-001
R1-DOCUMENTATION-PATTERNS.md
Section 8 (if has inline)
`OD-001
If source file is T1 (LOCKED):
	•	Do NOT modify the file directly
	•	Document in OD-CHECKPOINT.md: "T1 file [path] should list OD-001 as consumer but is LOCKED"
	•	The bidirectional link exists conceptually; it will be formalized during maintenance

██ APPENDIX E: SUB-AGENT PARADIGM — ACCUMULATED CONTEXT, NOT GENERIC SEARCH ██
███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Philosophy: Why Accumulated Context Matters
The problem with generic search:
Generic prompt: "Research cognitive load patterns in documentation"

Result: Wikipedia article on cognitive load theory, random Medium posts,
academic papers with no connection to our system.

Why it fails: The search has no IDENTITY. It doesn't know that we've
already validated PULSE rhythm. It doesn't know DD-006's fractal principle.
It doesn't know our 5 soul pieces. The results can't INTEGRATE because
they were found without context.
The solution: Context-rich search:
Context-rich prompt: "Research cognitive load patterns in documentation.

CONTEXT I CARRY:
- DD-006 establishes fractal self-similarity as highest-scoring density principle (36/40)
- DD-001 establishes PULSE rhythm (breathing) for information flow
- OD-001 is applying these to conversational documentation structure
- Soul Piece #1 says sharpness = precision = trust
- R1-007 claims Q&A reduces cognitive load by 23% but sample was small

MY QUESTION:
Find external evidence that VALIDATES or CHALLENGES the claim that
rhythmic information density (like PULSE) reduces cognitive load.

INTEGRATION PATH:
- If VALIDATES: This becomes EXTERNAL-V-### linked to DD-001
- If CHALLENGES: Flag for review, note in DD-001's RESEARCH DEBT
- If EXTENDS: Potential input for AD density decisions"

Result: Targeted findings that can INTEGRATE into our provenance chain
because they were sought with our accumulated understanding.
How to Build Accumulated Context for Sub-Agent Prompts
Step 1: Traverse the inline sections you've consumed
Before OD-003, you've read:
	•	DD-003 inline section (ISLANDS density)
	•	DD-006 inline section (Fractal)
	•	MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md inline section (5 soul pieces)
	•	R1-015 ("task-based org outperforms feature-based")
	•	Previous OD iterations
Step 2: Extract the IDENTITY you've accumulated
From these inline sections, you now know:
I KNOW:
- Task clusters should behave as ISLANDS (sparse space around clusters)
- Fractal self-similarity means task groups at page level mirror section level
- 5 soul pieces constrain all visual decisions
- R1-015 is my primary hypothesis, but it's from a single study
- OD-003 iteration 1 scored 31/40 — task clusters felt too uniform

I DON'T KNOW:
- What spacing between task clusters is optimal? (DD-003 said "sparse" but not HOW sparse)
- Does task-based organization work for highly technical content?
- Is R1-015's claim ("outperforms") validated by other research?
Step 3: Formulate context-rich sub-agent prompt
## 🎯 SUB-AGENT MISSION: Validate R1-015 Task-Based Organization

### 📦 CONTEXT I CARRY (Accumulated from Inline Section Traversal)

**My Current Understanding:**
- OD-003 is testing task-based documentation organization
- R1-015 claims "task-based organization outperforms feature-based" (single study)
- DD-003 ISLANDS pattern establishes that task clusters need sparse surrounding space
- DD-006 Fractal principle requires task structure at page/section/component scales
- Soul Piece #1 (Sharp Edges) = precision; task boundaries should be crisp
- OD-003 iteration 1 scored 31/40; task clusters felt too uniform (not enough differentiation)

**Constraints Active (From Inline MUST HONOR Tables):**
- Task clusters must be ISLANDS — surrounded by whitespace (DD-003)
- Structure must be fractal — task groups nest consistently (DD-006)
- All elements sharp — no rounded task cards (MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS)

**What I'm Uncertain About:**
- Is R1-015's claim validated by broader research?
- What spacing makes task clusters feel like distinct ISLANDS?
- Does task-based organization hold for API reference docs? (R1-015 was about tutorials)

### 🔍 YOUR TASK

Search for external research on:
1. Task-based vs feature-based documentation organization (validate R1-015)
2. Optimal spacing for task clusters / visual grouping in documentation
3. Information foraging theory as it applies to task-oriented navigation

### 📤 OUTPUT FORMAT

| External Source | Finding | Relationship to R1-015 | Relationship to DD-003 | Confidence Impact | Integration |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Author, Year, Title] | [specific finding] | VALIDATES/CHALLENGES/EXTENDS | VALIDATES/CHALLENGES/EXTENDS | +X% or -X% | [how to integrate] |

### 🔗 INTEGRATION PATH

**If finding VALIDATES R1-015:**
- ID: EXTERNAL-V-### 
- Update R1-015 confidence in RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
- Note in OD-003 inline section's BUILT ON table
- Strengthen "task-based" in organizational-patterns.md

**If finding CHALLENGES R1-015:**
- ID: EXTERNAL-V-### with CHALLENGES flag
- Add to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md under "Challenged Findings"
- Add to OD-003 inline section's RESEARCH DEBT
- Reassess OD-003 hypothesis before continuing

**If finding EXTENDS (new insight):**
- ID: EXTERNAL-E-###
- Evaluate: Does this apply to AD? CD?
- Add to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md under "External Extensions"
- Consider for OD-003 iteration 2 or flag for future phase

### ⛔ DO NOT

- Return generic cognitive load articles without connection to our context
- Return findings that can't be integrated (no clear relationship to our system)
- Skip the integration path — every finding must have a home

External Finding Integration Protocol (Detailed)
When a sub-agent returns a finding:
1. ASSIGN ID
EXTERNAL-V-### = Validates an internal finding
EXTERNAL-E-### = Extends an internal finding  
EXTERNAL-G-### = Fills a gap (answers question we had)
2. CREATE ENTRY IN RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
### EXTERNAL-V-007
- **Source:** Pirolli & Card, 1999, "Information Foraging"
- **Finding:** Task-based organization mirrors foraging behavior; 
  clear "patches" (clusters) with clear paths between them
- **Validates:** R1-015 (task-based > feature-based)
- **Also Validates:** DD-003 ISLANDS (clusters need sparse surrounding)
- **Specific Contribution:** 48-64px optimal for cluster boundaries
- **Confidence Impact:** R1-015 +15%, DD-003 +10%
- **Integration:** Applied in OD-003 iteration 2
3. UPDATE INTERNAL FINDING'S INLINE SECTION
In R1-DOCUMENTATION-PATTERNS.md (if it has inline section), add to BUILT ON:
| EXTERNAL-V-007 | External validation | Pirolli & Card confirm task-based | checkpoints/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md |
In DD-003 inline section, add to BUILT ON:
| EXTERNAL-V-007 | Spacing validation | 48-64px for cluster boundaries | checkpoints/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md |
4. NOTE IN CURRENT EXPLORATION'S INLINE SECTION
In OD-003 inline section, BUILT ON table:
| EXTERNAL-V-007 | External validation | 48px cluster gap | checkpoints/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md |
5. THE FINDING NOW HAS A HOME
Future phases (AD, CD) will find EXTERNAL-V-007 via:
	•	OD-003's inline section (BUILT ON)
	•	DD-003's inline section (BUILT ON)
	•	RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md (External Findings section)
The external knowledge is INTEGRATED, not isolated.

What This Section Adds (Summary)
Now the protocol includes:
	0.	WHY accumulated context matters — the philosophy, not just the mechanics
	0.	HOW to extract context — step-by-step from inline sections
	0.	CONCRETE EXAMPLE — a complete context-rich sub-agent prompt
	0.	CONTRAST — generic vs context-rich, showing the anti-pattern
	0.	THE LOOP — explicit visual of how compounding works
	0.	INTEGRATION PROTOCOL — exactly how external findings get inline sections and link back

Updated Protocol Completeness
Gap
Status After Additions
File placement knowledge
✅ FIXED — Appendix C with decision tree, anti-sprawl rules, canonical locations
Inline section exact structure
✅ FIXED — Appendix D with exact format, concrete OD-001 example, bidirectional protocol
Sub-agent paradigm with accumulated context
✅ FIXED — Appendix E with philosophy, context extraction, concrete prompt, compounding loop
The protocol is now comprehensive for the paradigm we've built.












Yes, exactly. Let me be crystal clear about the intent and verify the protocol captures it correctly:
The Intent (As I Understand It)
ENCOURAGE:
	•	New research findings (OD-F-001, OD-F-002, etc.)
	•	New explorations (OD-001 through OD-006)
	•	New pattern files when a NEW pattern type emerges (organizational-patterns.md)
	•	New external findings (EXTERNAL-V-###, EXTERNAL-E-###, EXTERNAL-G-###)
	•	New soul pieces if cognitive truths are discovered
	•	Growing the knowledge base
DISCOURAGE:
	•	Duplicate tracking files (OD-TRACKING.md when RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md exists)
	•	Scattered findings (OD-FINDINGS.md instead of adding to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md)
	•	Orphan files without inline sections
	•	Files that don't update the web (create file, forget to link it)
THE KEY PRINCIPLE:
Every new file GROWS the web by:
1. Having its own inline section (so it can BE consumed)
2. Updating source files' CONSUMED BY (so the web knows about it)
3. Living in the right location (so it's findable)

NOT by:
- Being isolated
- Duplicating what exists
- Breaking the threading

Verification: Does the Protocol Capture This?
Let me check Appendix C:
Current language that might be TOO restrictive:
"Before creating ANY new file, ask..." "Should I Create a New File?" Test
This could read as "don't create files" when the intent is "create files CORRECTLY."
What needs adjustment:
The framing should be:
	0.	YES, create new files — research grows, findings emerge, explorations are built
	0.	BUT create them in the right place
	0.	AND give them inline sections
	0.	AND update the threading (CONSUMED BY in sources, BUILT ON in the new file)

Proposed Adjustment to Appendix C
Let me revise the framing:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
██ APPENDIX C: FILE CREATION & PLACEMENT — GROWING THE WEB CORRECTLY        ██
███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Growth Principle
Research GROWS. Findings EMERGE. New files are EXPECTED.
The goal is NOT to prevent file creation. The goal is to ensure every new file:
	0.	Has an inline section — so it can be consumed by future phases
	0.	Updates source files — so the web knows about it (CONSUMED BY updates)
	0.	Lives in the right location — so it's findable and doesn't duplicate
	0.	Is threaded bidirectionally — BUILT ON points backward, sources point forward
A new file that follows these rules STRENGTHENS the web. A new file that ignores these rules FRAGMENTS the web.

Anti-Pattern: What NOT To Do
Anti-Pattern
Why It's Wrong
Correct Approach
Create OD-FINDINGS.md
Duplicates RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
Add findings to RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
Create OD-TRACKING.md
Duplicates OD-CHECKPOINT.md
Use state snapshots in OD-CHECKPOINT.md
Create exploration without inline section
File can't be consumed, breaks threading
Always create inline section
Create file without updating sources
Web doesn't know about it
Update source CONSUMED BY tables
Put exploration in wrong folder
Unfindable, breaks navigation
Use explorations/organizational/
Create file without noting in FOLDER-MAP.md
Navigation layer incomplete
Update FOLDER-MAP.md for new folders/significant files
The Threading Checklist (For Every New File)
When you create a new file, complete this checklist:
## Threading Checklist for [New File Path]

### 1. Inline Section Created
□ Tier determined: [A/B/C]
□ All required sections populated
□ BUILT ON table complete (all sources listed)
□ MUST HONOR table complete (constraints from sources)
□ CONSUMED BY table initialized (may be empty if new, will grow)

### 2. Source Files Updated
□ [Source 1 path] — CONSUMED BY updated to include this file
□ [Source 2 path] — CONSUMED BY updated to include this file
□ [Source 3 path] — CONSUMED BY updated to include this file
(If source is T1/LOCKED: note in checkpoint, don't modify)

### 3. Navigation Updated
□ FOLDER-MAP.md updated (if new folder or significant file)
□ Relevant CLAUDE.md updated (if affects folder contents)

### 4. Tracking Updated
□ OD-CHECKPOINT.md notes file creation
□ RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md updated (if file contains/is a finding)

### Threading Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE

Does This Capture the Intent?
The message is now:
	0.	CREATE new files — research grows, that's good
	0.	Create them CORRECTLY — right location, with inline section
	0.	Thread them BIDIRECTIONALLY — update sources, establish consumers
	0.	Don't DUPLICATE — if canonical location exists, add to it
The web GROWS with every new file, but only if the file is threaded in.
Is this what you meant? The protocol should ENCOURAGE creation while ENSURING the threading stays intact?

























































Looking at this comprehensively, I need to analyze the current OD Execution Protocol against everything we've built - the inline threading sections, navigation layer, alignment document insights, README's sub-agent paradigm, and the modification guard mindset. Let me create the definitive updated version.

If context has been compacted or you are resuming from scratch:
RECOVERY PHASE 1: ORIENTATION (5 min)
READ IN THIS EXACT ORDER:
1. FOLDER-MAP.md (docs-spa/app/showcase/FOLDER-MAP.md)
   → Understand the entire codebase structure at a glance
   → Note which folders are T1 (authoritative) vs T2 (derivative)
   → Find the "Context Recovery" section for current phase state
   
2. showcase/CLAUDE.md
   → Understand what showcase/ is for
   → Get the lab navigation overview
   
3. DESIGN-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md
   → Understand the design system's current state
   → Note the 4 engagement levels
RECOVERY PHASE 2: STATE RESTORATION (5 min)
4. checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md
   → Know EXACTLY where you are (which OD, which iteration, what score)
   → Read the LATEST state snapshot entry (not just the checkbox)
   → Note: "Currently working on" and "Next action"
   
5. checkpoints/OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md
   → Know which research findings are mapped to which OD
   → Know which findings have been applied vs still pending
   
6. checkpoints/MASTER-STATE.md
   → Know overall project position
RECOVERY PHASE 3: CONSTRAINT LOADING (5 min)
7. The INLINE SECTION of your target file
   → Open the file you're about to work on
   → READ THE ENTIRE INLINE SECTION (the comment block at top)
   → Extract: MUST HONOR constraints, BUILT ON sources, WHAT BREAKS warnings
   → Answer the DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS before proceeding
   
8. checkpoints/SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md
   → Reload the 5 soul pieces (possibly more if OD discovered new ones)
   
9. T1 Authority Files (read inline sections only):
   → perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md
   → perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/DESIGN-TOKEN-SUMMARY.md
RECOVERY PHASE 4: SKILL + VISUAL STATE (5 min)
10. The LATEST screenshot for the current OD
    → audit-screenshots/od-explorations/OD-[###]-iteration-[#].png
    → LOOK at it. Know the visual state.
    
11. This protocol document
    → Re-read from the current phase onward
    
12.  ~/.claude/skills/perceptual-deepening/SKILL.md
    → Re-invoke the skill. Extract sub-agents fresh.
THEN: Resume at the exact point indicated by OD-CHECKPOINT.md
DO NOT start building until all 12 steps are complete. DO NOT rely on memory. Read from files. DO NOT skip reading inline sections — they contain constraints that WILL break things if violated.

██ SECTION 0: THE PARADIGM SHIFT — INLINE SECTIONS AS MODIFICATION GUARDS   ██
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
What Changed After Phase 2B
Phase 2B added inline threading sections to 253 files. These sections are NOT documentation. They are MODIFICATION GUARDS — safety systems that prevent you from breaking things you don't understand.
The Old Way (Pre-Phase 2B):
1. Read checkpoint files
2. Build exploration
3. Hope you didn't break anything
The New Way (Post-Phase 2B):
1. Read FOLDER-MAP.md for orientation
2. For EVERY file you will touch:
   - Open the file
   - Read the INLINE SECTION FIRST
   - Note "Must Honor" constraints
   - Note "What Breaks If Changed"
   - Answer Diagnostic Questions
3. Build exploration with constraints ACTIVE
4. Update inline sections of files you created/modified
The Inline Section Structure
Every significant file now has this structure at the top:

What DD Answered vs What OD Must Answer
DD asked: "How should information FEEL visually?"
	•	DD discovered density RHYTHMS: breathing, gradient, islands, layers, rivers, fractal
	•	DD validated that rhythm applies at ALL scales (fractal principle from DD-006)
	•	DD established the visual vocabulary we now BUILD ON
	•	DD's inline sections now document these discoveries with full provenance
OD asks: "How should information UNFOLD MENTALLY?"
	•	Not visual density — COGNITIVE organization
	•	Not pixel spacing — NARRATIVE structure
	•	Not layout geometry — CONCEPTUAL flow
	•	How the READER'S MIND moves through documentation
	•	OD must READ DD's inline sections to understand the constraints
Why OD Comes After DD and Before AD
DD before OD because:
	•	You need visual rhythm vocabulary before you can structure cognitive flow
	•	DD-006's fractal principle (rhythm at all scales) directly informs OD
	•	DD's CRESCENDO (sparse→dense) maps to OD's Confidence-Based (certain→uncertain)
	•	DD's breathing patterns inform how OD structures expand and contract
	•	DD's inline sections contain the "MUST HONOR" constraints that OD inherits
OD before AD because:
	•	Organization defines WHAT content goes where conceptually
	•	Axis (AD) defines WHERE content goes spatially
	•	You can't decide layout geometry until you know how content is organized
	•	OD-005 (Spatial/Map) might require AD-003 (Bento Grid) — discover the need in OD
	•	OD's inline sections will become MANDATORY inputs for AD
DD Findings That DIRECTLY Feed OD

OD-001: Conversational Structure
Hypothesis: What if documentation was a DIALOGUE?
	•	Reader asks questions, documentation responds
	•	Components play roles: Essence = wise elder's aside, Gotcha = "watch out!", Tip = friendly colleague, Challenge = "try this yourself"
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTION FIRST):
	•	DD-005 Rivers — questions WIDEN the river (sparse), answers NARROW it (dense)
	•	MANDATORY: Read showcase/explorations/density/DD-005-*.html inline section
	•	Extract: MUST HONOR constraints from DD-005
Research:
	•	R-1 (documentation patterns that use Q&A)
	•	R-5 (component voices in dialogue)
Density pattern to use: PULSE (question=sparse, answer=dense, question=sparse)
OD-002: Narrative Arc
Hypothesis: What if technical content told a STORY?
	•	Setup (context) → Rising Action (complexity) → Climax (the hard part) → Resolution (clarity)
	•	Components map: Info=exposition, Code=action, Gotcha=plot twist, Essence=theme statement
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTIONS FIRST):
	•	DD-001 Breathing — narrative tension mirrors breathing rhythm
	•	DD-002 CRESCENDO — complexity builds like a crescendo
	•	MANDATORY: Read inline sections of both DD-001 and DD-002 files
	•	Extract: MUST HONOR constraints from both
Research:
	•	R-1 (narrative documentation)
	•	R-2 (editorial layouts that tell stories)
Density pattern: CRESCENDO (sparse setup → dense climax → resolved ending)
OD-003: Task-Based
Hypothesis: What if organization followed "I want to..."?
	•	Goal-oriented: user has a TASK, documentation serves that task
	•	Components map: Task=the goal, Code=the steps, Gotcha=the pitfalls, Challenge=stretch goals
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTION FIRST):
	•	DD-003 Islands — tasks are CLUSTERS of related information
	•	MANDATORY: Read showcase/explorations/density/DD-003-*.html inline section
	•	Extract: MUST HONOR constraints from DD-003
Research:
	•	R-1 (task-based documentation)
	•	R-5 (component sequencing for tasks)
Density pattern: BOOKENDS (dense task header → sparse explanation → dense verification)
OD-004: Confidence-Based
Hypothesis: What if information flowed from CERTAIN to UNCERTAIN?
	•	Start with what's definitely true, progress to nuance, end with edge cases
	•	Components map: Essence=axioms (most certain), Info=established, Tip=recommendations, Gotcha=exceptions, Challenge=open questions
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTIONS FIRST):
	•	DD-002 CRESCENDO — certainty→uncertainty mirrors sparse→dense
	•	DD-004 Geological — layers of certainty like geological strata
	•	MANDATORY: Read inline sections of both DD-002 and DD-004 files
	•	Extract: MUST HONOR constraints from both
Research:
	•	R-3 (cognitive density)
	•	R-1 (progressive disclosure patterns)
Density pattern: CRESCENDO (sparse certainty → dense uncertainty)
OD-005: Spatial/Map
Hypothesis: What if documentation was a MAP you navigate?
	•	Hub-and-spoke: central concept with branching paths
	•	Non-linear: reader CHOOSES direction, not forced scroll
	•	Components map: CoreAbstraction=hub, Decision=crossroads, File Tree=map legend
DD connection (READ INLINE SECTION FIRST):
	•	DD-006 Fractal — map at every zoom level
	•	MANDATORY: Read showcase/explorations/density/DD-006-*.html inline section
	•	Extract: This is the HIGHEST SCORING DD (36/40) — its constraints are elevated
Research:
	•	R-2 (creative layouts)
	•	R-4 (bento/spatial patterns)
	•	R-5 (hub-spoke combinations)
Density pattern: WAVE (density varies by path chosen)
OD-006: Creative Slot
	•	Whatever EMERGES from building OD-001 through OD-005
	•	Might combine multiple organizational strategies
	•	Might discover an entirely new paradigm
	•	Let the work teach you what's missing
	•	Must honor ALL constraints accumulated from OD-001 through OD-005

5 Soul Pieces (VERIFY IN EVERY OD ITERATION)
#
Soul Piece
Truth
What to Check
T1 Source
1
Sharp Edges Command Authority
border-radius: 0 = precision
ALL containers sharp
MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md
2
The Archivist Speaks in Serif
Serif italic = wisdom voice
Essence/CoreAbstraction serif
MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md
3
Callouts Share Family DNA
2-zone = family cohesion
Label + body structure
MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md
4
Shadows Lie About Depth
box-shadow: none = honesty
No shadows anywhere
MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md
5
Squares Signal System
Square shapes = exactness
Step indicators square
MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md
CRITICAL: Read the inline section of perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md to understand the full context of each soul piece. The inline section contains:
	•	WHY this file is authoritative (T1 status)
	•	WHAT BREAKS if you violate any soul piece
	•	DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS to verify soul compliance

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
Research findings are NOT markdown files to check off. They are FUEL. They must:
	0.	Be MAPPED before building (not vaguely "referenced")
	0.	Be APPLIED with evidence during building (not assumed)
	0.	Be VERIFIED after building (not forgotten)
	0.	GENERATE NEW FINDINGS that feed future phases (not dead-end)
	0.	Be STORED in the design system so AD/CD can consume them (not lost)
	0.	Be TRACEABLE through inline sections (not scattered)

THE KEY PRINCIPLE: RESEARCH IS BIDIRECTIONAL
Research doesn't just flow IN to OD. OD generates NEW research that flows OUT:
Inbound: R-1 findings about documentation patterns → inform how OD-001 structures conversation
	•	Read the inline section of each R-1 finding before using it
	•	Note the "MUST HONOR" constraints
Outbound: OD-001 discovers that "questions need 2x the whitespace of answers" → NEW finding that:
	•	Gets stored in organizational-patterns.md (for the design system)
	•	Gets stored in RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md (for tracking)
	•	Gets flagged as INPUT to AD (axis must accommodate question spacing)
	•	Gets flagged as INPUT to CD (component combinations must respect this rhythm)
	•	Gets an inline section documenting its provenance
	•	Updates the "CONSUMED BY" table in source files
Nothing discovered is a dead end. Everything feeds forward. The inline sections make this traceable.
THE COMPOUNDING LOOP (From README Part V)
This is how research compounds — not just accumulates:

OD IS FERTILE GROUND FOR SOUL DISCOVERY
DD discovered 5 soul pieces about VISUAL truth:
	•	Sharp edges, serif wisdom, family DNA, honest flatness, square exactness
OD explores COGNITIVE truth. New soul pieces are EXPECTED here.
Potential OD soul pieces might sound like:
	•	"Questions Need Air" — reader questions require sparse breathing room
	•	"Certainty Compresses" — the more certain, the more concise
	•	"Stories Need Turning Points" — narrative organization requires a moment of surprise
	•	"Tasks Are Islands" — goal-oriented content clusters naturally
These are hypothetical examples. The REAL soul pieces emerge from the work.
DURING EVERY ITERATION, ASK:
"WHY does this organizational flow FEEL right or wrong?"

If you can answer that with a perceptual truth that applies broadly,
you have found a new soul piece.

Sub-Agent E (Soul Documenter) is not optional for OD.
It is where OD's unique contribution to the soul emerges.

DOCUMENT every potential soul piece immediately.
Don't wait for the end. Write it into SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md
the moment you feel it.

AND: Add it to the inline section of the exploration file
under "4. SOUL ALIGNMENT" with "CANDIDATE SOUL PIECE" marker.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Lesson from DD: Audit DURING, Not After
DD approach (what we did):
Built → Scored → Discovered broken → Audited → Fixed → Re-audited
OD approach (what we do now):
Read inline sections → Invoke skill FIRST → Load ALL context → 
Build WITH sub-agents → Audit DURING every iteration → 
Verify at end → Create inline sections → Interweave upward
The perceptual-deepening skill is the BUILD METHODOLOGY, not a post-hoc check. The inline sections are the CONSTRAINT SYSTEM, not post-hoc documentation.

███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THIS PHASE DOES NOT EXIST IN THE OLD PROTOCOL. IT IS MANDATORY FOR ALL POST-PHASE-2B WORK.
Purpose
Before building ANY OD exploration, you must read the inline sections of all files you will consume. This is not optional. The inline sections contain constraints that WILL break things if violated.
0.5.1 For Every File You Will CONSUME
For OD-001, you will consume DD-005, DD-006, and various R-1 findings. For each:
## INLINE SECTION PRE-FLIGHT: [Filename]

### File: [path]
### Read: [timestamp]

### 1. STATUS
[ACTIVE/SUPERSEDED] | [LOCKED/EDITABLE]
If LOCKED: STOP. You cannot modify this file without Phase-level approval.

### 2. MUST HONOR (Copy verbatim from inline section)
| Constraint | Source | Consequence of Violation |
|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| [constraint 1] | [source] | [consequence] |
| [constraint 2] | [source] | [consequence] |

### 3. WHAT BREAKS IF CHANGED (Copy key items from inline section)
- [file/system 1] — [how it breaks]
- [file/system 2] — [how it breaks]

### 4. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS (Answer before proceeding)
Q1: [question from inline section]
A1: [your answer]

Q2: [question from inline section]
A2: [your answer]

### 5. DECISION
□ I understand the constraints and will honor them
□ I understand what breaks if I violate these constraints
□ I have answered all diagnostic questions
□ CLEARED TO PROCEED
0.5.2 For Every File You Will MODIFY
If you will create or modify a file, you need to know its inline section requirements:
For new files (like OD-001 exploration):
	•	You MUST create an inline section when you complete the exploration
	•	Use the Tier A/B/C template from Phase 2B (see Appendix)
	•	Populate: WHY THIS EXISTS, BUILT ON, MUST HONOR, WHAT BREAKS, CONSUMED BY
For existing files (like density-patterns.md):
	•	Read its inline section FIRST
	•	Check if it's LOCKED
	•	If you add content, update the inline section's "WHAT BREAKS" if blast radius changes

Did any organizational concept FAIL because a COMPONENT doesn't support it?
Example: "The conversational flow breaks because CodeBlock has no way to visually signal 'pause' — it's always the same density. The component needs a 'sparse mode' or 'breathing mode' for organizational context."
If YES:
	•	Document in OD-CHECKPOINT.md → Downward Trace Log
	•	DO NOT just work around it
	•	The component gap is a FINDING that feeds back to the design system
	•	Note for inclusion in OD exploration's inline section under "RESEARCH DEBT"
	•	Component gap found? YES/NO
	•	If YES: Component: ______ Gap: ______ Impact: ______
	•	Documented in Downward Trace Log: □
B.10 OUTBOUND FINDINGS CHECK
Did this iteration GENERATE any new insight that AD/CD needs?
Example: "Conversational structure works best with PULSE density — this means AD layouts for conversational content need to accommodate alternating density zones."
If YES:
	•	Document in OD-CHECKPOINT.md → Research Findings Generated

1. WHY THIS EXISTS
This file catalogs the 6 validated organizational patterns discovered during
OD Phase (Phase 2.2). It defines HOW information should UNFOLD MENTALLY in
KortAI documentation. These patterns are the cognitive complement to DD's
density patterns — DD defines visual rhythm, OD defines cognitive flow.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
"How should documentation be organized to serve different content types
and reader goals?"

3. STATUS
ACTIVE | LOCKED after OD completion | [size]

4. SOUL ALIGNMENT
All 6 patterns were validated against the 5 soul pieces:
- SP#1-5: 100% compliance across all patterns
- [Any new cognitive soul pieces discovered during OD]

| Fractal self-similarity | DD-006 | Pattern must work at page/section/component scales |
| Soul pieces in all patterns | MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md | Visual identity violated |

7. WHAT BREAKS IF THIS CHANGES
- **AD explorations** — Choose organizational pattern BEFORE axis geometry
- **CD explorations** — Respect organizational flow when combining components
- **Migration pipeline** — Classify existing docs by organizational pattern
- **Blast radius:** All AD work, all CD work, all migration work

8. CONSUMED BY
| Consumer | How It Uses This File |

| CD-### explorations | Respect org flow in combinations |
| Migration pipeline | Classify docs by pattern |

9. RESEARCH DEBT
[Any patterns that need more validation]
[Any edge cases not covered]

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

Q2: Are all density pairings validated, not assumed?
Q3: Do all patterns have specific component role mappings?

□ INBOUND: Findings from R-1/R-5/R-3 applied with evidence □ OUTBOUND: New findings generated and tagged for AD/CD □ DOWNWARD: Component gaps documented in trace log □ RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md updated with all three directions
Checkpoints (Content-Rich + Context-Survivable)
□ OD-CHECKPOINT.md has FULL STATE SNAPSHOTS (not just checkmarks) □ Every iteration has: score, key issue, hypothesis, next action, screenshot □ DD constraint compliance tracked per iteration □ Survives complete context loss via Recovery Protocol (15-25 min recovery)
Quality
□ Average ≥34/40 (DD quality bar) □ DD↔OD design family coherence confirmed □ DD inline constraints honored
Upward Flow
□ MASTER-STATE.md updated □ DISCOVERIES-LOG.md updated □ RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md updated (inbound + outbound) □ organizational-patterns.md CREATED (OD's design system contribution) □ SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md updated (if new pieces) □ OD-SYNTHESIS.md CREATED □ OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md FINALIZED □ FOLDER-MAP.md updated (if new folders)
Inline Sections (NEW — MANDATORY)
□ All 6 OD exploration files have inline sections □ organizational-patterns.md has inline section □ All inline sections include: WHY, BUILT ON, MUST HONOR, WHAT BREAKS, CONSUMED BY □ Bidirectional updates complete — source files' CONSUMED BY updated □ Tier classification correct (OD explorations = Tier B, org-patterns = Tier A)
Handoff to AD
□ OD inline sections ready for AD consumption □ organizational-patterns.md inline section ready □ OD outbound findings documented with inline sections □ AD knows to read OD inline sections before starting
OD PHASE STATUS: [COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE]
INLINE SECTIONS: [X]/7 COMPLETE (6 OD + 1 patterns file)
READY FOR AD EXPLORATIONS: [YES/NO]
AD MUST CONSUME: organizational-patterns.md + OD exploration inline sections + DD constraints (still active)

██ EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS — NON-NEGOTIABLE                                  ██
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
	0.	ORIENT FIRST (Phase -1). Read FOLDER-MAP.md. Read relevant CLAUDE.md files. Know where you are before touching anything.
	0.	INVOKE /perceptual-deepening FIRST (Phase 0). Before any code. Read it. Extract sub-agents. The skill is PERCEPTUAL TECHNIQUES, not a form.
	0.	READ INLINE SECTIONS BEFORE TOUCHING FILES (Phase 0.5). This is the paradigm shift. Every file you consume has an inline section. Read it. Extract constraints. Answer diagnostic questions. This is not optional.
	0.	PASS THE RESEARCH GATE. Create OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md with specific finding-by-finding mapping + DD inline constraint verification BEFORE building. Not "I loaded it." Actual finding IDs → specific ODs → specific implementation plans → specific evidence criteria → DD constraint awareness. This is a DELIVERABLE.
	0.	SUB-AGENTS = LOOKING, NOT FILLING. When the skill says squint, SQUINT. When it says point to the worst area, POINT. Specific observations. Not "looks good."
	0.	CHECK DD INLINE CONSTRAINTS EVERY ITERATION. The inline sections contain "MUST HONOR" tables. Check them. Every iteration. 0 violations required for INCLUDE.
	0.	CHECKPOINT = STATE SNAPSHOTS. Every iteration: score, key issue, hypothesis, next action, screenshot path, DD constraint status. A fresh Claude can resume from the checkpoint alone (15-25 min recovery).
	0.	RESEARCH FLOWS BIDIRECTIONALLY. Inbound (R-1→OD), outbound (OD→AD/CD), and downward (OD→components). Track all three. Nothing discovered is lost. Everything feeds forward. Document in inline sections.
	0.	5 SOUL PIECES EVERY ITERATION + SEEK NEW ONES. DD found visual truths. OD explores cognitive territory. New soul pieces are EXPECTED. Sub-Agent E is active, not optional.
	0.	DD LESSONS ARE INPUTS. DD density patterns feed OD. DD-006 fractal principle applies everywhere. DD quality bar (34.5) must be met. DD inline sections are the authoritative source.
	0.	MINIMUM 3 ITERATIONS. Convergence requires evidence, not assumption.
	0.	CREATE INLINE SECTIONS FOR ALL OUTPUTS. Every OD exploration file gets an inline section. organizational-patterns.md gets an inline section. Bidirectional updates to source files. This is how AD knows what to consume.
	0.	INTERWEAVE UPWARD. organizational-patterns.md is OD's unique contribution. AD and CD CONSUME it via its inline section. If it doesn't exist or lacks inline section, AD/CD build on sand.
	0.	SURVIVE COMPACTION. If context is lost, the Recovery Protocol (15-25 min) + the state snapshots in OD-CHECKPOINT.md + the inline sections of target files should be sufficient to resume at full quality.

This is the comprehensive OD Execution Protocol v2.0, updated to incorporate:
	0.	Inline threading sections as mandatory pre-flight and output
	0.	Navigation layer awareness (FOLDER-MAP.md, CLAUDE.md files)
	0.	DD inline constraint tracking throughout all iterations
	0.	Bidirectional threading (updating source files' CONSUMED BY)
	0.	Context recovery enhanced to 15-25 min with inline section focus
	0.	Sub-agent paradigm from README Part V
	0.	Compounding loop explicit in research flow
	0.	Tier A/B templates for OD outputs
	0.	Phase -1 (Orientation) and Phase 0.5 (Pre-Flight) as new mandatory phases
	0.	Edge case mitigations embedded throughout
The structure is designed to extrapolate to AD and CD protocols with the same foundation but stage-specific content.

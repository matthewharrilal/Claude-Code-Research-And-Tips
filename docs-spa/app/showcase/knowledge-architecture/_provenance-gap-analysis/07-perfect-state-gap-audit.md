# PART 1: THE PERFECT STATE DEFINITION

What follows is the gold standard -- not "what DD achieved" but what PERFECT provenance looks like for the OD stage. DD is the floor, not the ceiling. Every dimension of perfection is defined independently of what currently exists.

---

## 1.1 Forward Traversability

**Definition of Perfect:** Every finding produced by OD can be traced from its origin (the OD exploration + research input that produced it) through the current stage (formal OD-F-### registration) to its next stage consumers (AD, CD, Migration). This means:

1. **OD-F-### findings formally declared** in `OD-outbound-findings.md` with the same structural rigor as DD-F-### findings in `DD-outbound-findings.md`: ID, Finding text, Source exploration, Score basis, Target stage(s), Chain Impact narrative.
2. **Meta-pattern identified and elevated.** DD elevated DD-F-006 FRACTAL as "THE STRONGEST PRINCIPLE" with a dedicated section. If OD produced a meta-finding (OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density" is the candidate), it receives equivalent elevation with full justification.
3. **Forward-looking findings for AD, CD, Migration** organized by target stage with "How [Stage] Should Apply" instructions -- exactly as DD-F-010 through DD-F-014 did for OD/AD/CD.
4. **Finding Consumption Matrix** showing which AD/CD/Migration stage consumes which OD-F-### finding, using the same grid format as DD-outbound-findings.md's matrix.
5. **HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md exists** with the same structural completeness as HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md: mandatory consumption table, soul piece transfer, quality bar, primary research for AD, OD iteration lessons, AD responsibilities checklist, OD-to-axis pairing table, and acknowledgment protocol.
6. **PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md Section B updated** with actual OD-F-### finding entries (not "TBD -- OD explorations not yet complete").
7. **PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md Section D updated** with Organizational Patterns provenance table (Pattern | Research | Generated Finding | Validated By | Score).
8. **BACKBONE.md Section 4 updated** from placeholder ("The Story (Unfolding)") to complete narrative with consumed/produced tables and key decisions.

**The test:** A fresh AD agent reads `HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md` and can list every constraint, every finding, every pairing, every responsibility -- without reading any OD exploration HTML file or checkpoint document.

---

## 1.2 Backward Traversability

**Definition of Perfect:** Every element of every OD exploration artifact can be traced backward to the research that justified it. This means:

1. **Every OD exploration inline header** contains a complete `Applied Research` section listing every R-1, R-3, R-5, DD-F, and EXT finding applied, with specific evidence of where in the HTML file that application appears. (This CURRENTLY EXISTS for all 6 OD explorations at varying levels of detail.)
2. **OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md** contains a finding-by-finding mapping of R-1 through OD explorations with `Implementation Plan`, `Expected Evidence`, and `DD Constraint` columns. (This CURRENTLY EXISTS at 86% R-1 coverage.)
3. **OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md post-build addendum** showing which findings were ACTUALLY applied vs. which were PLANNED but not applied, with explanations for any delta. The gate is a DELIVERABLE, not just a pre-build checklist -- it should be updated after build to reflect reality.
4. **RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md** fully updated with every OD-applied finding showing its status change from PENDING to APPLIED with the specific OD exploration as evidence.
5. **Every design decision in every OD HTML file** (font choice, spacing value, color selection, structural pattern) can be traced through the inline header to a research finding ID, then through PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md to the original R-file.
6. **EXT-* findings** (external research from the 8 parallel research agents) have formal IDs, are registered somewhere in the provenance chain (not just in inline headers), and can be looked up by ID.
7. **OD-006's CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md** is formally linked into the provenance chain, not an orphaned research document.

**The test:** Point to any CSS line, any HTML structure, any spacing value in any OD exploration and trace it back through provenance to original research within 3 hops.

---

## 1.3 Cross-Traversability

**Definition of Perfect:** You can move sideways between OD explorations and understand their relationships -- what they share, where they diverge, and why. This means:

1. **OD-SYNTHESIS.md exists** with cross-OD analysis covering: which patterns share density pairings, which patterns discovered similar insights, which patterns diverge and why, quality dialect analysis (the Polished/Functional/Editorial distinction from the audit), and the meta-insight about organization-density equivalence.
2. **3 Quality Dialects formally documented:** The audit discovered that OD-001/002 form "Polished" dialect, OD-003/004/005 form "Functional" dialect, and OD-006 forms "Editorial" dialect. This cross-cutting insight must be formally captured with evidence (which features differ, why the gap exists, what it means for pattern selection).
3. **OD exploration cross-reference table** showing: for each pair of ODs, what they share (soul compliance, fractal compliance, shared tokens) and where they diverge (creative techniques, external research depth, density pairing effectiveness).
4. **Cumulative identity tracking:** Each OD builds on the previous. OD-001 contributed conversational width variation. OD-002 validated that narrative arc creates CRESCENDO. OD-003 validated task islands. A formal document tracks how the ACCUMULATED IDENTITY changed from OD-001 through OD-006, step by step.
5. **OD-006 as synthesis document:** OD-006 explicitly references OD-001 through OD-005 and claims to synthesize all patterns. This cross-reference should be formally verified: does OD-006 actually demonstrate all 5 prior patterns? Where? With what success?

**The test:** A user asks "What is the relationship between OD-003 (Task-Based) and OD-005 (Spatial)?" and can find the answer in a single document without reading both 100KB HTML files.

---

## 1.4 Accumulation Integrity

**Definition of Perfect:** The next stage (AD) receives ALL accumulated constraints from all prior stages, not just the new OD ones. This means:

1. **HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md** includes the complete constraint inheritance chain: 5 Soul Pieces (from Stage 1), COMP-F-### findings (from Stage 1), DD-F-### findings (from Stage 2), OD-F-### findings (from Stage 3), all anti-patterns (from all stages), and the quality bar (from all stages).
2. **Constraint count grows monotonically:** Stage 1 had 5 soul pieces + 21 COMP-F findings. DD added 18 DD-F findings. OD should add its OD-F findings. The total constraint count should be explicitly stated in the handoff: "AD inherits N total constraints."
3. **No constraint is silently dropped.** Every DD-F finding that was CONSUMED by OD should be marked as such. Every DD-F finding that PASSES THROUGH to AD (like DD-F-006 FRACTAL, DD-F-012 density-implies-axis) should be explicitly forwarded.
4. **Quality bar accumulates:** DD achieved 34.5/40 avg. OD achieved its own scores. The HANDOFF should state the COMBINED quality standard for AD.
5. **Research application rate accumulates:** R-3 was ~76% applied in DD. R-1 was ~86% mapped in OD. The PIPELINE-MANIFEST should show cumulative research consumption rates across ALL research streams.

**The test:** Count the total constraints in HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md vs. HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md. The latter must be strictly larger.

---

## 1.5 Finding Lifecycle

**Definition of Perfect:** Every finding's status is tracked from discovery through validation through application through export. This means:

1. **OD-F-001 through OD-F-008** have formal lifecycle records showing: (a) when discovered, (b) in which exploration, (c) what evidence supports them, (d) whether they were validated by audit, (e) their current status (PENDING/APPLIED/EXEMPLARY/ACTIVE), (f) which downstream stages consume them.
2. **DD-F finding status updated for OD consumption:** DD-F-001 through DD-F-005 were marked "PENDING" for OD in PIPELINE-MANIFEST. After OD completion, their status should transition to "APPLIED" or "CONSUMED" with the specific OD exploration as evidence.
3. **R-1 finding lifecycle updated:** 24 of 28 R-1 findings were mapped in OD-RESEARCH-GATE. Each should now show APPLIED status with specific evidence, or remain PENDING with justification for non-application.
4. **EXT-* finding lifecycle:** External findings (EXT-CONV, EXT-TASK, EXT-CONF, EXT-SPAT, EXT-CREATIVE) need lifecycle status. Were they applied? In which OD? What evidence?
5. **OD-002/003/004/005 findings:** OD-CHECKPOINT documents OD-F-001 through OD-F-004 (from OD-001) and OD-F-005 through OD-F-008 (from OD-006). But OD-002, OD-003, OD-004, and OD-005 each have key insights documented in OD-CHECKPOINT -- are these insights elevated to formal OD-F-### findings? Or were they intentionally left as informal observations? If the latter, what is the criteria for elevation?

**The test:** For any finding ID (e.g., OD-F-005), state its complete lifecycle from discovery to current status with evidence at each transition.

---

## 1.6 Score Justification

**Definition of Perfect:** Every OD score can be audited against explicit criteria. This means:

1. **Scoring rubric formally defined.** OD-001 is scored ~35/40 with breakdown (Innovation: 8, Utility: 9, Soul: 9, Execution: 9). The rubric that generates these numbers must be documented: what does Innovation 8 vs. 9 look like? What specific criteria differentiate scores?
2. **Every OD exploration has a formal score** with the same rubric and the same breakdown. Currently, OD-001 has a 4-dimension breakdown. OD-002 through OD-006 say "INCLUDE" or "~33/40" without dimension breakdowns.
3. **Scores are comparable.** The same rubric applied to DD-001 (33/40) and OD-001 (~35/40) should mean the same thing. Cross-stage score comparability must be documented.
4. **Score changes from audit tracked.** DD-001 went from 30.5 to 33 after re-audit (+2.5). Did any OD exploration score change after the granular adversarial audit? After the 16-fix execution? These score trajectories must be documented.
5. **Final scores post-fix.** The 16-fix execution addressed 89 findings (8 critical, 6 high). Did this change any OD scores? Were scores re-evaluated after fixes? If not, what does the pre-fix score mean?

**The test:** Given OD-002's score of ~33/40, identify which specific criteria lost it 7 points and whether the audit/fix cycle recovered any of them.

---

## 1.7 Decision Documentation

**Definition of Perfect:** The WHY behind every significant design decision in OD is captured, not just the WHAT. This means:

1. **Key Decisions section in STAGE-HEADER.md** listing 5-10 major decisions with What/Why/Impact structure -- matching DD's 5 key decisions format.
2. **Per-exploration decision record** documenting: why this density pairing was chosen (and what alternative was considered), why this content topic was selected, why certain creative techniques were included/excluded, why the score landed where it did.
3. **OD-006 emergent decisions:** OD-006 claimed "Organization IS Density." This is the biggest decision of the entire OD phase. The reasoning chain from hypothesis to evidence to conclusion must be formally documented -- not just stated as a finding.
4. **3-Dialect decision:** The audit revealed 3 quality dialects. Was this intentional? Was OD-001 enriched with creative techniques while OD-003/004/005 were not? Why? What was the decision? This is a design decision about the exploration process itself that needs documentation.
5. **Fix prioritization decisions:** 17 fixes were identified. Fix #1 and #7 were determined "NO FIX NEEDED." Fix #17 was deferred. The reasoning for each decision should be formally captured in the provenance record (it exists in FIX-STATE.md but not in the provenance chain).

**The test:** A designer asks "Why does OD-001 have scroll witnesses and solid offsets while OD-002 has neither?" The answer should be findable in a provenance document.

---

## 1.8 Negative Space

**Definition of Perfect:** Things that were REJECTED, AVOIDED, or DELIBERATELY NOT DONE are documented, not just things that were chosen. This means:

1. **Anti-patterns avoided per exploration** documented formally (not just in inline headers). Each OD exploration lists 3-5 anti-patterns in its inline header. These should be aggregated into a formal "OD Anti-Pattern Avoidance Record."
2. **Rejected density pairings documented.** The HANDOFF recommended specific pairings (e.g., OD-001 with PULSE). Were alternative pairings considered and rejected? Was there ever a moment where OD-003 was considered for CRESCENDO instead of ISLANDS? If so, why was it rejected?
3. **Research findings deliberately NOT applied.** OD-RESEARCH-GATE maps 24 of 28 R-1 findings. The 4 unmapped findings should be explicitly documented with reasons for non-application.
4. **Audit findings deliberately NOT fixed.** Fix #17 was deferred. Fix #1 and #7 were false positives. The full audit had 89 findings; only 17 became fix items. What happened to the other 72? Were they notes? Were they accepted? Were they rejected? This negative space is undocumented.
5. **Things OD could have done but did not:** OD could have discovered cognitive soul pieces (DD-F-011 predicted this). OD could have created a new density pattern for OD-005 (the HANDOFF said "Custom" density). OD could have scored higher if enriched like OD-001 was. These paths-not-taken should be documented as negative space.

**The test:** "What did OD decide NOT to do, and why?" has a clear, documented answer.

---

## 1.9 Emergence Tracking

**Definition of Perfect:** Discoveries that EMERGED during OD -- not predicted by the handoff, not derived from research -- are formally captured with full reasoning chains. This means:

1. **OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density"** is the most important emergence. It should have: (a) a discovery narrative (how was this insight discovered? which exploration? what specific observation?), (b) evidence chain (what specific patterns in which OD explorations prove this claim?), (c) implications chain (what does this mean for AD, CD, Migration?), (d) comparison to DD-F-006 (both are meta-findings -- how do they relate? does OD-F-005 extend DD-F-006 or is it a separate axis?).
2. **OD-F-006 "Meta-Documentation as Purest Density Test"** -- this is a process emergence. The discovery that content ABOUT density creates the best density is a methodological insight. It should be formally captured with methodology implications.
3. **OD-F-007 "Mode-Transition Breathing"** -- the discovery that switching organizational modes requires breathing zones. This emerged from OD-006's multi-mode structure. It should be formally documented as a constraint for AD/CD (which will also combine modes).
4. **OD-F-008 "Compound Creative Techniques"** -- the discovery that creative techniques compound when layered. This should be documented with evidence (which techniques were layered? what was the measured or perceived compound effect?).
5. **3 Quality Dialects** -- this emerged from the audit, not from the exploration process. It is a process-level emergence that should be formally documented as a finding (potentially OD-F-009 or similar).
6. **"2px border epidemic" (108 CSS declarations)** -- this systemic issue emerged from the audit. It is an anti-pattern emergence that should be formally captured.
7. **External research integration** as emergence: OD-001 was enriched with 13 external research findings. This enrichment process itself was emergent (8 parallel research agents). The methodology emergence should be documented.

**The test:** List every emergent discovery from OD with its full reasoning chain. If you cannot, the emergence is inadequately tracked.

---

## 1.10 Soul Evolution

**Definition of Perfect:** If OD discovered new soul pieces, they are formally added to the soul registry with full discovery context. This means:

1. **SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md** either has new entries for OD-discovered soul pieces, or has a formal record stating "OD explored cognitive rhythm but did not discover a new soul piece" with justification.
2. **DD-F-011 predicted** that "Cognitive soul pieces may emerge from OD." This prediction must be formally resolved: did they emerge? If yes, document them. If no, document why not.
3. **OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density"** is the strongest candidate for a soul piece. It transcends a single exploration -- it is a perceptual truth about the relationship between organization and density. Should it be Soul Piece #6? This decision must be formally made and documented, not left implicit.
4. **Soul compliance matrix extended.** BACKBONE.md Section 9 shows a soul compliance matrix for DD-001 through DD-006. A corresponding matrix for OD-001 through OD-006 must exist, with each soul piece verified per exploration.
5. **The audit verified 0 soul violations across 3,479 elements.** This verification result should be formally added to the soul compliance record as evidence.

**The test:** Open SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md. Does it contain OD entries? If not, is there a formal "no new soul pieces" determination?

---

## 1.11 Anti-Pattern Evolution

**Definition of Perfect:** If OD validated new anti-patterns, they are formally added to the anti-pattern registry. This means:

1. **DESIGN-SYSTEM/anti-patterns/registry.md** either has new OD-discovered anti-pattern entries, or explicitly states OD validated existing anti-patterns without discovering new ones.
2. **"2px border epidemic"** identified in the audit (108 CSS declarations, 1000+ computed instances) should be formally registered as an anti-pattern. DD-F-016 said "Inconsistent border widths." The OD audit confirmed this is systemic. The anti-pattern needs formal registration with evidence and prevention.
3. **"3 quality dialect" divergence** -- the fact that enrichment was unevenly applied across OD explorations could be an anti-pattern ("Uneven Enrichment Depth" or similar). Should it be registered? This decision needs to be made formally.
4. **Audit-discovered issues** that are not strictly anti-patterns but are systematic (missing `<main>` landmarks, flat heading hierarchy, callout label contrast failures) should be catalogued as "OD-discovered implementation patterns to avoid" or formally linked to existing anti-patterns.
5. **DD anti-pattern verification results.** DD-F-015 (traffic-light), DD-F-016 (inconsistent borders), DD-F-017 (uniform density), DD-F-018 (fighting the pattern) were all checked in the OD audit. Their verification results should be formally documented: which ODs had issues? Which were clean?

**The test:** Open the anti-pattern registry. Does it reflect anything learned from the OD phase?

---

## 1.12 Audit Integration

**Definition of Perfect:** The OD audit results (89 findings from 17 agents, 16 fixes applied, 187 programmatic tests) are part of the provenance record, not just operational scratch files. This means:

1. **Audit synthesis document in provenance directory.** DD has `DD-REAUDIT-PERCEPTUAL-SYNTHESIS.md` in its provenance directory. OD should have an equivalent: a formal audit synthesis that distills the 89 findings, 16 fixes, 2 false positives, 3 quality dialects, and 0 soul violations into a provenance-chain document.
2. **OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md** (620 lines, currently in `knowledge-architecture/`) should either be moved to or linked from the provenance directory.
3. **Fix results formally integrated.** The 16 fixes that were applied, the 2 false positives, and the 1 deferral should be summarized in the provenance chain. Not the full FIX-STATE.md, but a "what changed and why" record.
4. **Score adjustments post-audit.** If scores changed (or did not change) after the audit+fix cycle, this should be formally documented.
5. **Audit methodology as process finding.** The 17-agent adversarial audit with 4 phases (~45 min) is a process innovation. It should be captured as a process finding for future stages (AD, CD).
6. **Scratchpad as evidence, not provenance.** The 29 files in `_od-audit-scratchpad/` (9,275 lines, 528KB) are raw evidence. They should NOT be in the provenance chain directly. But the provenance chain should reference them as evidence (e.g., "See `_od-audit-scratchpad/systematic-audit-001.md` for OD-001 detailed audit").

**The test:** A fresh agent reads the provenance chain and knows that OD explorations were audited, what was found, what was fixed, and what the final state is -- without reading 29 scratchpad files.

---

## 1.13 Reproducibility

**Definition of Perfect:** A completely fresh agent, with access ONLY to the provenance pipeline (no inline headers, no operational files, no scratch documents), could reconstruct what OD produced and why. This means:

1. **The provenance directory alone is sufficient.** Reading `stage-3-organization-od/` should tell you: what OD explored, what it consumed, what it produced, what constraints it honored, what findings it generated, what quality it achieved, what the next stage needs, and where the artifacts live.
2. **No critical information trapped in operational files.** The OD-F findings (OD-F-001 through OD-F-008) exist ONLY in `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md` lines 140-157. They are not in any provenance file. This means the provenance chain is incomplete -- a fresh agent reading only provenance would not know these findings exist.
3. **No critical information trapped in inline headers.** The inline headers on OD exploration HTML files contain rich provenance data (Applied Research, Soul Alignment, Built On, Must Honor, etc.). But an agent reading the provenance directory would not see this data unless they also read the HTML files. The provenance chain should contain a SUMMARY of what the inline headers contain, not require reading 600KB of HTML to extract provenance.
4. **External research is discoverable.** EXT-* findings are documented in inline headers and in `OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md`. But this research feed is in the explorations directory, not the provenance directory. A provenance-only reader would not find it.
5. **Audit results are discoverable.** The audit results are in `knowledge-architecture/OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md` and `knowledge-architecture/_od-audit-scratchpad/`. A provenance-only reader would not find them.
6. **Process innovations are documented.** The 17-agent audit methodology, the 4-fixer parallel fix execution, the weaver pattern, the 8-agent parallel research -- these process innovations are documented in MEMORY.md and various operational files, but not in the provenance chain.

**The test:** Delete everything except the `DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/` directory. Can a fresh agent reconstruct the OD phase? Currently: no.

# PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE GAP AUDIT

Every piece of current OD state is now audited against the gold standard defined in Part 1.

---

## 2.1 Missing Files

### GAP-001: OD-outbound-findings.md -- MISSING

**Perfect state:** A formal document in `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/OD-outbound-findings.md` containing OD-F-001 through OD-F-008 (and any additional findings) with the same structural rigor as `DD-outbound-findings.md`: ID, Finding text, Source exploration, Score basis, Target stage(s), Chain Impact narrative. Plus a meta-pattern section for OD-F-005, forward-looking findings for AD/CD, anti-pattern findings, a consumption matrix, and a Stage 2 consumption verification table.

**Current state:** File does not exist. `STAGE-HEADER.md` line 158 and `CLAUDE.md` line 69 both list it as "PENDING." The 8 OD-F findings exist ONLY in `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md` lines 140-157 as informal table entries.

**Delta:** 100% missing. The most structurally important provenance document for OD does not exist. All 8 findings are trapped in an operational checkpoint file with no chain impact columns, no consumption matrix, no meta-pattern elevation, no forward-looking instructions for AD.

**Raw material locations:**
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md` lines 140-157: OD-F-001 through OD-F-008 with names, descriptions, and source files
- `OD-006-creative.html` inline header lines 34-37: OD-F-005 through OD-F-008 with descriptions
- `OD-001-conversational.html` inline header: no explicit OD-F IDs, but key insights documented
- 6 OD exploration inline headers: contain Applied Research, DD Constraints, anti-patterns avoided

**Traversals broken:** Forward (findings cannot flow to AD/CD/Migration), Finding Lifecycle (findings have no formal lifecycle record), Reproducibility (provenance-only reader cannot find OD findings), Accumulation (HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD cannot exist without this)

---

### GAP-002: HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md -- MISSING

**Perfect state:** A gate document in `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md` with the same structural completeness as `HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md` (338 lines): purpose + acknowledgment protocol, organizational pattern table with scores/descriptions/AD usage instructions, OD outbound findings mandatory consumption table, soul piece transfer (5 visual + any cognitive), quality bar comparison (OD achieved vs AD must match), primary research for AD (R-4 as primary, 192 findings), OD iteration lessons, AD responsibilities checklist (files to create, files to update, verifications to pass), OD-to-axis pairing table, and acknowledgment checklist.

**Current state:** File does not exist. `STAGE-HEADER.md` line 159 and `CLAUDE.md` line 70 both list it as "PENDING."

**Delta:** 100% missing. Without this file, AD cannot begin work according to the pipeline protocol. The HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md explicitly required this file at line 249: "provenance/stage-3-organization-od/HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md" as part of OD's responsibilities.

**Raw material locations:**
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD state snapshots with scores, density pairings, key insights, DD sources, R-1 findings
- `OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md`: R-1 finding-by-finding mapping with DD constraint cross-references
- `HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md`: template for structure and content expectations
- 6 OD exploration inline headers: complete constraint and research records

**Traversals broken:** Forward (AD has no gate file), Accumulation (constraint inheritance chain broken), Reproducibility (AD agent cannot start work from provenance alone)

---

### GAP-003: OD-SYNTHESIS.md -- MISSING

**Perfect state:** A cross-OD synthesis document in `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/OD-SYNTHESIS.md` containing: cross-OD pattern comparison, shared insights, divergent approaches, 3-quality-dialect analysis, cumulative identity evolution from OD-001 through OD-006, OD-F-005 meta-insight analysis, and the relationship between organizational patterns and density patterns.

**Current state:** File does not exist. `STAGE-HEADER.md` line 161 and `CLAUDE.md` line 72 both list it as "PENDING." `OD-CHECKPOINT.md` line 8 says "Currently Working On: Synthesis documents."

**Delta:** 100% missing. Cross-traversability between OD explorations requires this document. Without it, understanding the relationship between OD-003 and OD-005 requires reading 200KB+ of HTML.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD state snapshots with key insights, density pairings, scores
- `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md`: 3-dialect analysis, cross-OD systemic issues
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/cross-od-consistency.md` (40KB): detailed cross-OD comparison
- 6 OD exploration inline headers: per-exploration summaries

**Traversals broken:** Cross-Traversability (no single document to understand OD relationships), Reproducibility (provenance-only reader has no synthesis)

---

### GAP-004: organizational-patterns.md -- MISSING

**Perfect state:** A pattern definition document in `DESIGN-SYSTEM/patterns/organizational-patterns.md` with the same structural rigor as `density-patterns.md`: each pattern with name, provenance (research + finding IDs), validation evidence (exploration + score), usage guide, density pairing, constraints, and CSS implementation notes.

**Current state:** File does not exist. `OD-CHECKPOINT.md` line 40 explicitly shows "organizational-patterns.md | X | X | X". `PATTERN-INDEX.md` lists all 6 OD patterns as "Pending."

**Delta:** 100% missing. The design system's patterns directory has validated density patterns but no organizational patterns. A designer looking up "how to organize Q&A documentation" finds nothing in the design system.

**Raw material locations:**
- `PATTERN-INDEX.md`: placeholder entries for all 6 OD patterns with density pairings
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD density pairings, key insights, scores
- 6 OD exploration inline headers: per-pattern implementation details

**Traversals broken:** Forward (patterns cannot be applied by migration), Cross-Traversability (no single pattern reference), Reproducibility (design system has no OD patterns)

---

### GAP-005: OD Audit Synthesis in Provenance -- MISSING

**Perfect state:** A formal audit synthesis document in `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/` (or formally linked from there) distilling the 89 findings, 16 fixes, 2 false positives, 3 quality dialects, and 0 soul violations into a provenance-chain document -- equivalent to DD's `DD-REAUDIT-PERCEPTUAL-SYNTHESIS.md`.

**Current state:** The audit data exists in two places OUTSIDE the provenance directory:
- `knowledge-architecture/OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md` (620 lines)
- `knowledge-architecture/_od-audit-scratchpad/` (29 files, 9,275 lines)
Neither is linked from or present in the provenance directory.

**Delta:** The data exists but is not in the provenance chain. A provenance-only reader would not know OD was audited.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md`: complete audit synthesis
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/FIX-STATE.md`: fix execution record
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/fix-verification-programmatic.md`: 187 test results
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/fix-verification-visual.md`: 12 screenshot verifications

**Traversals broken:** Audit Integration (audit not in provenance), Reproducibility (provenance-only reader misses audit entirely)

---

## 2.2 Incomplete Files

### GAP-006: STAGE-HEADER.md -- STATUS STALE

**Perfect state:** A COMPLETE stage header with narrative "The Story" section (written in past tense about what happened, not future tense about what will happen), consumed/produced tables with actual values (not placeholders), quality achieved table with actual scores, key decisions section (5-10 major decisions with What/Why/Impact), and files-in-folder table showing all files as COMPLETE.

**Current state:** `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/STAGE-HEADER.md` (178 lines) exists but:
- Title says "IN PROGRESS -- Where Cognitive Rhythm Will Be Discovered" (future tense)
- "The Story (Unfolding)" section uses future tense ("Six explorations are planned")
- "What This Stage Will Consume" and "What This Stage Will Produce" use future tense
- Files table shows 5 of 6 files as "PENDING"
- No Quality Achieved table (DD has one with 7 metrics)
- No Key Decisions section (DD has 5 decisions)
- Inline threading header (line 33) says "OD work has not begun"

**Delta:** The stage header was written BEFORE OD work began and never updated AFTER completion. All 6 OD explorations are built, audited, and fixed, but the stage header still describes them as pending. This is the most visible stale-document gap.

**Raw material locations:**
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: actual scores, density pairings, key insights, build status
- `OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md`: research mapping data
- DD's `STAGE-HEADER.md`: template for complete structure

**Traversals broken:** Forward (agents reading this file think OD is not started), Reproducibility (stage header is primary navigation -- stale data misleads)

---

### GAP-007: CLAUDE.md -- STILL PLACEHOLDER

**Perfect state:** A complete navigation file with 5-section standard (Identity, How To Read, What's Here, How This Connects, Mindset), all file statuses accurate, reading order reflecting actual complete state, connection map updated.

**Current state:** `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/CLAUDE.md` (114 lines) exists but:
- Its own threading header (line 8) calls it "Placeholder navigation file"
- Status on line 41 says "IN PROGRESS" when all 6 ODs are complete and audited
- "What's Here" table (line 66) shows 5 of 6 files as "PENDING" -- but OD-RESEARCH-GATE actually EXISTS and is PASSED
- Does not mention the 3 files that now exist (STAGE-HEADER, CLAUDE.md, OD-RESEARCH-GATE)
- Does not mention that OD-outbound-findings, HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD, and OD-SYNTHESIS are the actual missing items

**Delta:** File exists but provides misleading navigation. An agent entering this directory would be told 5 files are pending when actually 3 exist and 3 are genuinely missing.

**Raw material locations:**
- DD's `CLAUDE.md`: template for complete 5-section structure
- Actual directory listing: 3 files exist

**Traversals broken:** Reproducibility (navigation is misleading), Forward (reading order suggests files that do not exist)

---

### GAP-008: OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md -- INCOMPLETE (Pre-Build Only)

**Perfect state:** A research gate that serves as BOTH a pre-build planning document AND a post-build verification record. After OD completion, it should contain: (a) the original finding-by-finding mapping, (b) a "What Was Actually Applied" addendum showing APPLIED/NOT-APPLIED status for each finding with evidence, (c) the delta between planned and actual application with explanations.

**Current state:** `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md` (145 lines) exists and has PASSED status, but:
- Contains only the pre-build mapping (Section 2: R-1 findings mapped to OD explorations with implementation plans)
- No post-build verification (did the planned implementations actually happen?)
- R-1 application target is stated as "86% mapped = achievable" but actual applied rate is not recorded
- Summary table (line 128) shows "R-1: 24 mapped" but not "R-1: N applied"
- Status says "PASSED" but this is the gate passing, not the post-build verification

**Delta:** The gate was used as a pre-build planning tool (correctly) but never updated as a post-build evidence record. The "PASSED" status is about the planning phase, not the execution phase.

**Raw material locations:**
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD R-1 findings listed with applied status
- `checkpoints/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md`: should have OD application records
- 6 OD exploration inline headers: "Applied Research" sections with evidence

**Traversals broken:** Backward (research application verification incomplete), Finding Lifecycle (R-1 findings show planned status, not applied status)

---

## 2.3 Stale Files

### GAP-009: PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md -- OD Sections Stale

**Perfect state:** Section B should contain OD-F-001 through OD-F-008 with formal entries. Section C soul pieces should reflect OD determination. Section D organizational patterns should have a provenance table. Section E cross-reference index should include OD example traces.

**Current state:**
- Section B, line 183: "Stage 3 (OD-F-###) -- Organization -- PENDING. TBD -- OD explorations not yet complete."
- Section C, line 206: "? | TBD | OD-F-??? | Cognitive | May emerge from OD | R1-* (organization)"
- Section D, line 223: "Organizational Patterns -- PENDING. TBD -- OD explorations not yet complete."
- No OD entries in Section E cross-reference examples
- Finding lifecycle states (Section F) counts are stale (do not include OD-F findings)

**Delta:** 4 sections of the master pipeline manifest are stale. The manifest is the CENTRAL REGISTRY -- stale data here means every consumer gets wrong information.

**Raw material locations:**
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md` lines 140-157: OD-F-001 through OD-F-008 data

**Traversals broken:** Forward (manifest says OD findings are TBD), Finding Lifecycle (manifest lifecycle counts are wrong), Reproducibility (central registry does not reflect actual state)

---

### GAP-010: BACKBONE.md Section 4 -- Stale

**Perfect state:** Section 4 should tell the completed story of OD with consumed/produced tables filled in, key decisions documented, and the causal chain updated from "IN PROGRESS" to "COMPLETE."

**Current state:**
- Section 4 title (line 222): "STAGE 3: ORGANIZATION (OD) -- IN PROGRESS"
- "The Story (Unfolding)" section uses future tense
- "What It Will Consume" and "What It Will Produce" tables use future tense
- No key decisions section
- Causal chain diagram (Section 10, line 331): still shows "OD organizational explorations (in progress)"
- Generated Research Flow (Section 8, line 297): "OD-F-### | TBD"
- Soul Pieces Matrix (Section 9): no OD rows

**Delta:** The master narrative of the entire design system says OD is in progress. This is the most-read provenance document. Its staleness propagates confusion to every reader.

**Raw material locations:**
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: complete OD data
- DD's Section 3 in BACKBONE.md: template for complete stage narrative

**Traversals broken:** Forward (backbone says OD is unfinished), Cross-Traversability (soul matrix lacks OD rows), Reproducibility (master narrative is wrong)

---

### GAP-011: PATTERN-INDEX.md -- OD Patterns Stale

**Perfect state:** All 6 OD organizational patterns listed with VALIDATED status, scores, density pairings, and provenance links. The "Usage Flowchart" updated to include OD pattern selection step.

**Current state:** All 6 OD patterns listed as "Pending" (lines 129-133, 335-340). Line 64: "OD patterns (organizational) not yet validated -- placeholder only."

**Delta:** The pattern index is the primary consumer-facing reference. A designer cannot find OD patterns.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD scores and density pairings
- Missing: `organizational-patterns.md` (the pattern index references a file that does not exist)

**Traversals broken:** Forward (patterns cannot be used by migration), Cross-Traversability (density + org pattern pairing not navigable)

---

### GAP-012: Explorations CLAUDE.md Files -- Partially Stale

**Perfect state:** `explorations/CLAUDE.md` and `explorations/organizational/CLAUDE.md` accurately reflect OD completion status with scores, audit results, and links to provenance.

**Current state:**
- `explorations/CLAUDE.md`: OD status shows COMPLETE with all 6 files listed. This is CORRECT.
- `explorations/organizational/CLAUDE.md`: Shows all 6 ODs as COMPLETE with visual audit PASS. This is CORRECT. Scores shown match OD-CHECKPOINT. This file is accurate.

**Delta:** These files are actually UP TO DATE -- they were updated during the OD phase. This is one of the few accurate navigation files.

**Raw material locations:** N/A -- files are current.

**Traversals broken:** None for these specific files.

---

## 2.4 Cross-Reference Breakage

### GAP-013: DD-outbound-findings.md Successor Pointer -- Broken

**Perfect state:** The YAML frontmatter `successor` field should point to an existing file.

**Current state:** Line 6: `successor: provenance/stage-3-organization-od/OD-outbound-findings.md` -- points to a file that does not exist.

**Delta:** Broken forward pointer. The chain link from DD to OD is declared but the target does not exist.

**Raw material locations:** N/A -- requires OD-outbound-findings.md to be created.

**Traversals broken:** Forward (chain link broken)

---

### GAP-014: OD STAGE-HEADER.md Inline Threading Header -- Stale

**Perfect state:** The inline threading header should reflect the actual state of the file (status, diagnostic answers, etc.).

**Current state:** Line 33: "OD work has not begun." This is false -- OD work is COMPLETE with all 6 explorations built, audited, and fixed.

**Delta:** The threading header was written before OD work began and never updated. Every agent reading this file's inline section gets wrong status information.

**Raw material locations:** Actual state is documented in OD-CHECKPOINT.md.

**Traversals broken:** Reproducibility (inline threading header says work not started)

---

### GAP-015: PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md Section B Consumption Matrix -- Missing OD Entries

**Perfect state:** DD-F-001 through DD-F-005 consumption matrix should show OD column updated from "PENDING" to "APPLIED" with specific OD exploration evidence.

**Current state:** The consumption matrix (Section B, DD-F entries) still shows OD as the target but with status "PENDING" (lines 171-180). The reality is that DD-F-001 was consumed by OD-001, DD-F-002 by OD-002/OD-004, DD-F-003 by OD-003, DD-F-004 by OD-004, DD-F-005 by OD-001, DD-F-006 by ALL ODs.

**Delta:** The consumption status of 18 DD-F findings has not been updated from PENDING to APPLIED/CONSUMED despite all 6 OD explorations being complete.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: DD Sources listed per OD exploration
- `OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md` Section 4: DD constraints inherited

**Traversals broken:** Finding Lifecycle (DD-F status not updated), Forward (downstream stages see PENDING instead of APPLIED)

---

## 2.5 Finding Lifecycle Gaps

### GAP-016: OD-F Findings Have No Formal Lifecycle Record

**Perfect state:** Each OD-F finding has: discovery date, source exploration, validation evidence, current status, consuming stages.

**Current state:** OD-F-001 through OD-F-008 exist only as table entries in `OD-CHECKPOINT.md` with: Finding ID, Name, Description, Source. No lifecycle status. No consuming stages. No validation evidence beyond source file reference.

**Delta:** OD-F findings are informal notes, not formal provenance records. They lack the structural integrity of DD-F findings.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md` lines 140-157: the only location where OD-F findings are defined
- `OD-006-creative.html` inline header: OD-F-005 through OD-F-008 referenced

**Traversals broken:** Finding Lifecycle (no lifecycle tracking for any OD-F finding), Forward (no consuming stage mapping)

---

### GAP-017: OD-002 through OD-005 Generated No Formal Findings

**Perfect state:** Each OD exploration generates findings. DD had 18 findings across 6 explorations. OD should have a proportional number.

**Current state:** OD-001 generated OD-F-001 through OD-F-004. OD-006 generated OD-F-005 through OD-F-008. OD-002, OD-003, OD-004, and OD-005 generated ZERO formal findings despite each having "Key Insights" documented in OD-CHECKPOINT:
- OD-002: "Narrative arc NATURALLY creates CRESCENDO density"
- OD-003: "Task-based structure NATURALLY creates ISLANDS density"
- OD-004: "Confidence-level organization NATURALLY creates GEOLOGICAL density"
- OD-005: "Hub-and-spoke spatial organization NATURALLY creates WAVE density"

**Delta:** 4 explorations have key insights that parallel OD-F-003 ("Q&A as Natural PULSE Generator") but were never elevated to formal OD-F findings. This creates an inconsistency: if "Q&A naturally creates PULSE" is OD-F-003, then "narrative arc naturally creates CRESCENDO" should be an OD-F finding too.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: key insights for each OD exploration

**Traversals broken:** Finding Lifecycle (insights exist but are not formalized), Forward (AD/CD cannot cite these insights by finding ID)

---

### GAP-018: R-1 Finding Application Status Not Finalized

**Perfect state:** Every R-1 finding mapped in OD-RESEARCH-GATE has a final APPLIED/NOT-APPLIED status with evidence.

**Current state:** `OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md` shows 24 of 28 R-1 findings mapped with implementation plans and expected evidence. But there is no post-build verification column. The gate status is "PASSED" (meaning the planning was approved), but the actual application was never formally verified against the plan.

**Delta:** The planned-vs-actual gap is unknown. We know R1-001 was planned for OD-001, but we don't have formal provenance confirmation that it was actually applied (though the inline headers suggest it was).

**Raw material locations:**
- 6 OD exploration inline headers: "Applied Research" sections list actually applied findings
- `checkpoints/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md`: should track applied status
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD R-1 findings listed

**Traversals broken:** Backward (research application verification incomplete)

---

### GAP-019: EXT-* Findings Not Registered in Pipeline

**Perfect state:** External research findings (EXT-CONV, EXT-TASK, EXT-CONF, EXT-SPAT, EXT-CREATIVE, EXT-DENSITY) are registered in PIPELINE-MANIFEST or a companion registry with formal IDs, sources, application status.

**Current state:** EXT-* findings appear ONLY in:
- OD exploration inline headers (e.g., EXT-CONV-001 through EXT-CONV-005 in OD-001)
- `OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md` (12 resources with extracted techniques)
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md` (counts per OD)

They do NOT appear in PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md, RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md (as formal entries), or any provenance chain document.

**Delta:** A significant body of external research (~50+ EXT-* findings across all OD explorations) exists outside the provenance chain. These findings were applied but are not traceable through the pipeline.

**Raw material locations:**
- Inline headers: per-OD EXT-* listings
- `OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md`: full research feed
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: EXT-* counts

**Traversals broken:** Backward (EXT-* findings not traceable in pipeline), Finding Lifecycle (EXT-* have no lifecycle record)

---

## 2.6 Score and Decision Gaps

### GAP-020: Scoring Rubric Not Documented

**Perfect state:** A formal scoring rubric that defines what each dimension (Innovation, Utility, Soul, Execution) means, what each score level (1-10) looks like, and how the 40-point total is computed.

**Current state:** OD-001 has a 4-dimension breakdown in OD-CHECKPOINT: "Innovation: 8, Utility: 9, Soul: 9, Execution: 9." No other OD exploration has a dimension breakdown. No rubric document exists. The scoring appears to be perceptual rather than criteria-based.

**Delta:** Scores exist but cannot be audited against criteria because no criteria exist.

**Raw material locations:**
- DD explorations may have scoring criteria in earlier documents
- `DD-REAUDIT-PERCEPTUAL-SYNTHESIS.md` may contain rubric information

**Traversals broken:** Score Justification (scores cannot be audited without rubric)

---

### GAP-021: OD-002 through OD-006 Scores Lack Dimension Breakdowns

**Perfect state:** Every OD exploration has a score with the same 4-dimension breakdown (Innovation, Utility, Soul, Execution) that OD-001 has.

**Current state:**
- OD-001: ~35/40 (Innovation: 8, Utility: 9, Soul: 9, Execution: 9) -- COMPLETE
- OD-002: ~33/40 -- NO BREAKDOWN
- OD-003: ~33/40 -- NO BREAKDOWN
- OD-004: "INCLUDE" -- NO NUMERIC SCORE, NO BREAKDOWN
- OD-005: "INCLUDE" -- NO NUMERIC SCORE, NO BREAKDOWN
- OD-006: "INCLUDE (crown jewel, targeting >=36/40)" -- TARGET SCORE ONLY, NO BREAKDOWN

**Delta:** 5 of 6 explorations lack the dimension breakdown that OD-001 has. 3 of 6 lack even a numeric score.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD score entries (as shown above)
- Audit results may contain implicit quality assessments

**Traversals broken:** Score Justification (scores incomplete or missing)

---

### GAP-022: No Key Decisions Section for OD Stage

**Perfect state:** A "Key Decisions" section in the OD STAGE-HEADER (or OD-SYNTHESIS) documenting 5-10 major decisions with What/Why/Impact structure.

**Current state:** No such section exists in any OD provenance document. The STAGE-HEADER is still a planning document. Key decisions are scattered across OD-CHECKPOINT, inline headers, and audit results.

**Delta:** Major design decisions (why OD-001 was enriched but OD-002 was not, why OD-006 is the crown jewel, why BOOKENDS was used as secondary for OD-003, why OD-005 used WAVE instead of ISLANDS as primary) are undocumented in the provenance chain.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD key insights hint at decisions
- `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md`: 3-dialect analysis reveals decision implications
- Inline headers: MUST HONOR sections encode some decisions

**Traversals broken:** Decision Documentation (decisions not formally captured), Reproducibility (decisions cannot be reconstructed from provenance alone)

---

## 2.7 Negative Space and Emergence Gaps

### GAP-023: No "Paths Not Taken" Record

**Perfect state:** A formal document (or section within OD-SYNTHESIS) recording: rejected density pairings, research findings deliberately not applied (4 of 28 R-1 unmapped), alternative approaches considered and rejected for each OD, reasons OD-005 did not create a new density pattern despite "Custom" recommendation, reasons no cognitive soul pieces were discovered despite DD-F-011's prediction.

**Current state:** No such record exists. The 4 unmapped R-1 findings are simply absent from OD-RESEARCH-GATE without explanation. The "Custom" density recommendation for OD-005 was replaced by "WAVE + ISLANDS" without a formal rationale.

**Delta:** 100% missing. All negative space is implicit.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md`: 24 of 28 mapped -- which 4 were excluded?
- `HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md`: OD-005 was "Custom" -- why did it become WAVE?
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: some hints in per-OD notes

**Traversals broken:** Negative Space (no record of what was rejected), Decision Documentation (choices require knowledge of alternatives)

---

### GAP-024: Audit Finding Disposition Not Fully Documented

**Perfect state:** All 89 audit findings have documented dispositions: fixed (16), false positive (2), deferred (1), and the remaining 70 classified as accepted/notes/low-priority with explicit acknowledgment.

**Current state:** FIX-STATE.md documents 17 fix items (16 applied + 1 deferred). OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md documents 89 findings. But the bridge between 89 findings and 17 fix items is not explicit. The other 72 findings (the ones that did not become fix items) have no formal disposition record.

**Delta:** ~72 audit findings have implicit dispositions (they were noted but not acted on) without formal acknowledgment. Were they accepted as-is? Were they too low priority? Were they aesthetic opinions rather than defects?

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md`: all 89 findings
- `FIX-STATE.md`: 17 fix items with statuses
- Gap: no mapping between the two

**Traversals broken:** Negative Space (undocumented audit disposition), Audit Integration (audit-to-fix path incomplete)

---

### GAP-025: Emergence Reasoning Chains Incomplete

**Perfect state:** Every OD-F finding that represents an EMERGENT discovery (not predicted by handoff) has a complete reasoning chain: observation -> hypothesis -> evidence -> conclusion -> implications.

**Current state:**
- OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density": described in OD-CHECKPOINT and OD-006 inline header but with no formal reasoning chain. The claim is stated but the evidence path (which specific observations in which explorations proved it) is not formally documented.
- OD-F-007 "Mode-Transition Breathing": described briefly but no formal analysis of what breathing room is needed or why.
- OD-F-008 "Compound Creative Techniques": states techniques compound but does not formally document which combinations were tested or what the compound effect was.

**Delta:** Emergent findings are STATED but not ARGUED. The reasoning chains that produced them are implied by proximity to the explorations but not formally documented.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-006-creative.html` inline header: emergence descriptions
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: key insight descriptions
- `OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md`: creative technique source material

**Traversals broken:** Emergence Tracking (reasoning chains absent), Reproducibility (emergence cannot be reconstructed from provenance)

---

## 2.8 Soul and Anti-Pattern Registry Gaps

### GAP-026: SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md -- No OD Entries or Formal Determination

**Perfect state:** Either contains new OD-discovered soul pieces, or contains a formal "OD Result: No new soul pieces discovered" entry with justification referencing DD-F-011's prediction.

**Current state:** SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md contains exactly 5 soul pieces from Stage 1 (Component Foundation). No OD entries. No formal determination about OD soul discovery. The file's soul piece index (line 206) still shows "? | TBD | OD-F-??? | Cognitive | May emerge from OD" in PIPELINE-MANIFEST (not in SOUL-DISCOVERIES itself).

**Delta:** DD-F-011 specifically predicted cognitive soul pieces might emerge from OD. This prediction is unresolved. OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density" is a candidate for Soul Piece #6. No formal evaluation was conducted.

**Raw material locations:**
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: OD-F-005 description
- `OD-006-creative.html`: OD-F-005 discovery context
- `HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md` lines 164-174: "Potential Cognitive Soul Pieces (OD May Discover)"

**Traversals broken:** Soul Evolution (prediction unresolved), Finding Lifecycle (OD-F-005 soul-piece candidacy not evaluated)

---

### GAP-027: Anti-Pattern Registry -- No OD Updates

**Perfect state:** `DESIGN-SYSTEM/anti-patterns/registry.md` updated with OD-validated anti-patterns and any new anti-patterns discovered during OD.

**Current state:** The anti-pattern registry has not been checked for OD updates. The audit confirmed DD anti-patterns (DD-F-015 traffic-light, DD-F-016 inconsistent borders, DD-F-017 uniform density, DD-F-018 fighting the pattern) but no formal update to the registry was made. The "2px border epidemic" (108 CSS declarations systemic issue) is not registered.

**Delta:** Anti-pattern registry does not reflect OD experience. The systemic 2px border issue is an empirically validated anti-pattern that remains unregistered.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md`: "108 thin-border CSS declarations" finding
- `FIX-STATE.md`: border fix categorization system
- 6 OD inline headers: anti-patterns avoided sections

**Traversals broken:** Anti-Pattern Evolution (registry not updated)

---

### GAP-028: Soul Compliance Matrix Missing OD Rows

**Perfect state:** BACKBONE.md Section 9 soul compliance matrix extended with OD-001 through OD-006 rows showing per-exploration soul piece verification.

**Current state:** Section 9 shows only DD-001 through DD-006 rows. No OD rows despite OD-CHECKPOINT confirming 100% soul compliance (0 violations across 3,479 elements) and the audit verifying all 5 soul pieces across all 6 ODs.

**Delta:** The definitive soul compliance matrix does not include OD data.

**Raw material locations:**
- `OD-CHECKPOINT.md`: per-OD soul compliance status
- `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md`: detailed soul audit per OD
- `FIX-STATE.md`: soul compliance verification (0 violations)

**Traversals broken:** Soul Evolution (compliance matrix incomplete), Cross-Traversability (cannot compare DD and OD soul compliance in one place)

---

## 2.9 Audit Integration Gaps

### GAP-029: Audit Methodology Not Captured as Process Finding

**Perfect state:** The 17-agent adversarial audit methodology (4 phases, ~45 min wall time) is formally captured as a process finding for future stages -- equivalent to DD-F-009 ("Iteration on perceptual feedback improved scores").

**Current state:** The audit methodology is documented in MEMORY.md (lines 43-59 of the project memory) and in `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md` (lines 1-8). It is NOT captured as a formal finding in the provenance chain.

**Delta:** A major process innovation (17-agent audit) exists only in operational memory, not in the provenance chain. Future AD/CD agents would not know this methodology exists unless they read MEMORY.md.

**Raw material locations:**
- MEMORY.md: agent team lessons
- `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md`: methodology description
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/AUDIT-STATE.md`: execution tracking

**Traversals broken:** Reproducibility (audit methodology not in provenance), Forward (AD/CD cannot learn from OD audit process)

---

### GAP-030: Fix Execution Not Captured as Process Finding

**Perfect state:** The 7-agent fix execution methodology (4 fixers + 2 verifiers + weaver, ~25 min wall time, per-file ownership pattern) is formally captured for future stages.

**Current state:** Documented in MEMORY.md (lines 14-27) and `FIX-STATE.md`. NOT in provenance chain.

**Delta:** Another process innovation exists only in operational memory.

**Raw material locations:**
- MEMORY.md: fix execution lessons
- `FIX-STATE.md`: execution record
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/fix-report-fixer-*.md`: per-agent reports

**Traversals broken:** Reproducibility, Forward

---

## 2.10 Reproducibility Gaps

### GAP-031: Provenance Directory Is Insufficient for Reconstruction

**Perfect state:** The provenance directory (`stage-3-organization-od/`) contains or links to everything needed to reconstruct what OD produced and why.

**Current state:** The directory contains 3 files (CLAUDE.md, STAGE-HEADER.md, OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md) totaling 437 lines. Of these:
- CLAUDE.md is a placeholder with stale information
- STAGE-HEADER.md is a pre-build planning document with future tense and PENDING statuses
- OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md is a pre-build research mapping with no post-build verification

A fresh agent reading ONLY these 3 files would conclude: OD is planned but has not begun. Zero explorations exist. Zero findings generated. Zero quality data available.

**Delta:** The provenance directory for OD provides approximately 5% of the information available about OD. The other 95% is in:
- `checkpoints/OD-CHECKPOINT.md` (163 lines)
- `OD-GRANULAR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md` (620 lines)
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/` (29 files, 9,275 lines)
- 6 OD exploration HTML files (inline headers: ~900 lines total of provenance data)
- `OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md` (~50KB of research)
- Various gap analysis files in `_provenance-gap-analysis/`

**Raw material locations:** All listed above.

**Traversals broken:** Reproducibility (provenance directory alone is radically insufficient)

---

### GAP-032: External Research Feed Orphaned from Provenance

**Perfect state:** `OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md` is formally linked in the provenance chain, referenced by OD-outbound-findings or OD-SYNTHESIS, with its EXT-CREATIVE findings registered.

**Current state:** The file exists at `explorations/organizational/OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md` (50KB, 12 resources). It is referenced by OD-006's inline header but NOT by any provenance chain document. No file in `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/` mentions it.

**Delta:** 50KB of formal research is disconnected from the provenance chain.

### GAP-033: Process Innovation Knowledge Trapped in MEMORY.md

**Perfect state:** Process innovations (17-agent audit, 4-fixer execution, weaver pattern, 8-agent research, per-file ownership) are captured as formal process findings in the provenance chain.

**Current state:** Process innovations documented in:
- `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` (project memory)
- `knowledge-architecture/OD-RETROSPECTIVE-AND-PROTOCOL-v2.md`
- `_od-audit-scratchpad/` operational files
None of these are in or linked from the provenance chain.

**Delta:** The most valuable process learnings from OD (binary rules achieve 100% compliance, per-file ownership eliminates contention, sequential verification prevents Playwright contention) are not accessible through the provenance pipeline.

**Raw material locations:**
- MEMORY.md: comprehensive process lessons
- `OD-RETROSPECTIVE-AND-PROTOCOL-v2.md`: protocol formalization

**Traversals broken:** Reproducibility, Forward (AD/CD process decisions made without OD lessons)

## KEY OBSERVATION

The single most important finding of this audit is GAP-031: **the OD provenance directory represents approximately 5% of the information available about OD, and that 5% is stale.**

The OD phase produced substantial, high-quality artifacts:
- 6 HTML explorations totaling ~575KB of validated, soul-compliant, audited work
- 8 formal OD-F findings
- 89 audit findings, 16 fixes, 187 programmatic verifications
- ~50+ external research findings
- Rich inline threading headers (~900 lines of provenance data embedded in HTML)
- 29 scratchpad files (9,275 lines of evidence)
- 620 lines of audit synthesis

But the provenance directory contains 3 files (437 lines), all stale, that tell a reader "OD is planned but has not begun." This is the maximum possible gap between reality and provenance representation.

The raw material to close every gap exists. The information is produced. It is scattered across checkpoints, inline headers, audit scratchpads, and project memory. The gap is not a knowledge gap -- it is a formalization gap. The work happened; the provenance chain was not updated to reflect it.

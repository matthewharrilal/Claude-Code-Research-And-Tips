## Category M: Process Integrity (14 items)

| ID | Check | Result | Evidence |
|----|-------|--------|----------|
| M-01 | Gate-based team topology functioned (Researcher -> Builder -> Scribe -> Verifier) | **PASS** | RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE.md Agent Log: Each wave follows sequence -- researcher-Na/Nb -> builder-Na/Nb -> scribe-N -> verifier-N. Wave 1: researcher-1a/1b -> builder-1a/1b -> scribe-1 -> verifier-1. Wave 2: researcher-2a/2b -> builder-2a/2b -> scribe-2 -> verifier-2. Wave 3: researcher-3a/3b -> builder-3a/3b -> scribe-3 -> verifier-3. Completion times show sequential ordering. |
| M-02 | No single agent carried both creative and provenance responsibilities | **PASS** | Agent Log shows role separation: researchers write research packages, builders modify OD HTML, scribes update provenance chain files, verifiers produce verification reports. Builder-1a wrote OD-001 HTML; scribe-1 updated OD-outbound-findings + OD-RESEARCH-GATE + EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY. No overlap in file ownership. |
| M-03 | All gates were binary (file exists or doesn't; test passes or doesn't) | **PASS** | verification-wave1.md: All 23 checks YES/NO binary. verification-wave2.md: All 23 checks PASS/FAIL binary (Check 5 was FAIL, then overridden to PASS with documented rationale -- browser cache false positive). verification-wave3.md: All 23 checks YES/NO binary. Zero judgment-based checks. |
| M-04 | All findings born in chain (not retrofitted post-hoc) | **PASS** | verification-wave1.md check 14: "No new dark matter... All research traceable: 6 EXT-CONV from research-package-od-001.md -> registered in EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md." Same confirmation in wave2 check 14 and wave3 check 14. Scribes updated EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY, OD-outbound-findings, OD-RESEARCH-GATE, RESEARCH-ACTIVE at each wave before gate check. |
| M-05 | Scribe maintained provenance in real-time (not deferred) | **PASS** | RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE.md: scribe-1 completed at ~00:24 (before verifier-1 at ~00:30). scribe-2 at ~00:56 (before verifier-2 at ~01:04). scribe-3 at ~12:28 (before verifier-3 at ~12:32). Scribes always finished before verifiers checked provenance. Wave 5 scribe-report.md confirms 11 files updated. |
| M-06 | Verifier blocked progress until gates passed | **PASS** | RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE.md Wave Status: Wave 1 Gate = "PASS (14/14)", Wave 2 = initially "CONDITIONAL FAIL" then "PASS (23/23)" after false positive override, Wave 3 = "PASS (23/23)". Wave 2 CONDITIONAL FAIL shows verifier DID block -- Lead had to investigate and override with documented rationale. |
| M-07 | Convention established before building (Wave 0 complete before Wave 1) | **PASS** | RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE.md: Wave 0 agents (convention, dm-a, dm-b, dm-d, screenshot) all completed before Wave 1 agents started. convention agent output: OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (468 lines) at ~23:48. Wave 1 researchers started after ~00:00. Convention agent completed in Wave 0 per design. |
| M-08 | Weaver tracked cross-agent state (if applicable) | **PASS** | RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE.md is the weaver output -- maintained throughout with per-wave status updates, Finding ID Tracker (3 wave entries), and Agent Log (30+ entries with status, files written, completion times). Lead maintained this file as central state tracker per RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE inline header: "Updated by Weaver after each agent completion." |
| M-09 | Per-file ownership prevented contention (if parallel agents used) | **PASS** | RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE Agent Log: researcher-1a wrote research-package-od-001.md + r2-evaluation.md; researcher-1b wrote research-package-od-002.md. builder-1a modified OD-001 only; builder-1b modified OD-002 only. Same pattern in Waves 2-3. No two agents modified the same file (except sequential scribe updates to shared provenance files AFTER builders completed). |
| M-10 | HTTP server started before any Playwright-dependent work | **PASS** | verification-wave1.md line 38: "Method: Playwright MCP programmatic DOM checks at http://localhost:8080/". Verifiers successfully loaded pages at localhost:8080 in all 3 waves. verification-wave2.md: "http://localhost:8080/explorations/organizational/OD-003-task-based.html loads". Server was operational before Wave 1 verification. |
| M-11 | Sequential verification (programmatic then visual) for audit work | **PASS** | Wave 5 audit: RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE.md shows traverser and identity-brief completed first (~13:15), then visual agents (audit-visual-a/b/c at ~13:35), then systematic agents (audit-systematic-a/b/c at ~13:40). Visual before systematic matches documented methodology. Consistency agent runs last as synthesizer. |
| M-12 | Lead did not build or run Playwright (THIN rule) | **PASS** | RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE Agent Log: Lead agent does not appear as any builder, researcher, verifier, or audit agent. All building done by builder-{N}{a,b} agents. All Playwright done by verifier-{N} and audit-visual/systematic agents. Lead's only file output: calibration-violations.md (54 lines -- calibration plant management, not building). |
| M-13 | All agents wrote reports/output before returning | **PASS** | RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE Agent Log "Files Written" column populated for every agent except dm-c (which failed -- documented as "COMPLETE (NO OUTPUT)"). Wave 4: synthesizer-report.md, updater-a-report.md, updater-b-report.md, handoff-writer-report.md all confirmed. Wave 5: scribe-report.md confirms 11 files updated. All agents have non-empty "Key Metrics" field. |
| M-14 | One committer, one branch (lead commits, never agents) | **PASS** | Git log shows commits by human user (spacewizardmoneygang), not by agent names. RE-ENRICHMENT-STATE does not show any agent-initiated git commits. Agent reports all state "COMPLETE" or "Files Written" without mentioning commits. Lead orchestrated all git operations per THIN rule. |

Per-page details show clean h1->h2->h3 progressions with zero skips. OD-001 uses only h1+h2 (no h3 needed). All others have clean 3-level hierarchies. |

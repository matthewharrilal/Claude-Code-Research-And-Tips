## Files Modified

### 1. OD-SYNTHESIS.md
**Path:** `DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/stage-3-organization-od/OD-SYNTHESIS.md`
**Lines:** ~673 (up from 516)

**Sections Updated:**
- **Section 1 (The OD Story):** Updated to reflect convention unification, dialect gap resolution, and 2px border remediation through re-enrichment. Changed "4 of 6 ODs" to "all 6 ODs" for bespoke research.
- **Section 2 (Consumed/Produced):** Updated EXT-* resource counts to post-re-enrichment totals (11 CONV, 11 NARR, 19 TASK, 18 CONF, 18 SPAT, 15 CREATIVE). Added OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md to consumed list. Updated produced artifacts to v3.
- **Section 3 (6-Pattern Analysis Table):** All 6 scores updated to v3 values (37, 35, ~35, 34, 35, 37). Per-dimension breakdowns added. Key insights updated with re-enrichment discoveries (Freytag, collapsible islands, border-weight gradient, 3-phase cascade, 5 fractal scales).
- **Section 4 (3-Dialect Analysis):** Title changed to "RESOLVED". Pre/post structure added for each dialect. Dialect Gap Resolution subsection added explaining convention unification.
- **Section 5 (Key Decisions):** Decision #4 updated (ALL 6 ODs now have bespoke research). Decision #5 added (convention unification). Decision #8 updated (numeric scores for all 6).
- **Section 6 (Negative Space):** New subsection 6c added for ANTI-PHYSICAL identity (20/20 SOUL FAILs).
- **Section 7 (Emergence Tracking):** New "Re-Enrichment Validation" subsection added documenting OD-F-005 confirmation at token level.
- **Section 8 (Scoring Summary):** Complete rewrite with all 6 v3 scores, per-dimension breakdowns, delta column, comparison to DD updated.
- **Section 9 (Research Consumption):** R-1 table updated with R1-020 and R1-028. Rate updated to 78.6% (22/28). EXT-* table updated to post-re-enrichment totals (95 resources, 91 applied, 95.8%).
- **Section 10 (Cross-OD Lessons):** Lessons 1-5 updated. Lessons 6-8 replaced/added: Dark Header Universal Amplifier, 2px Border Remediation, ISLANDS Dual Mode.
- **Section 11 (File Consumption Matrix):** Updated EXT-* counts. Added OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md row. Updated OD-002 observation.
- **NEW Section 12 (RE-ENRICHMENT DELTA):** Added with subsections: Overview, Before/After Scores, Convention Spec Impact, Identity Evolution Summary (3 waves), Key Discoveries (27 total), 20/20 SOUL FAIL Pattern, 5th Fractal Scale Discovery, Zone Token Validation, Dark Header Universality.
- **SOURCE EVIDENCE:** Updated with re-enrichment sources (convention spec, state tracker, identity deltas, verification reports, before measurements).
- **COMPACTION-SAFE SUMMARY:** Rewritten to reflect complete post-re-enrichment state.

### 2. OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md
**Path:** `DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/stage-3-organization-od/OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md`
**Lines:** ~460 (up from 389)

**Sections Updated:**
- **NEW Section 11 (RE-ENRICHMENT):** Added with subsections:
  - Overview (re-enrichment context)
  - What Was Fixed (9 categories: dialect gap, 2px borders, off-palette color, spirit violations, semi-transparent offsets, semi-transparent backgrounds, research debt, type-meta)
  - What Was Newly Discovered (9 key discoveries: zone tokens, ISLANDS dual mode, compound density, 5th fractal scale, border-weight gradient, ANTI-PHYSICAL, dark header, semi-transparent systemic, Quintuple Equivalence)
  - Wave 5 Audit Data (TBD placeholder with 5 recommended audit targets)
  - Re-Enrichment Score Impact (before/after/v3 table for all 6 ODs)
- **COMPACTION-SAFE SUMMARY:** Rewritten to reflect complete state including re-enrichment section count (11 sections), v3 scores, dialect gap resolved status, 69/69 re-enrichment gate checks.

### 3. organizational-patterns.md
**Path:** `DESIGN-SYSTEM/patterns/organizational-patterns.md`
**Lines:** ~455 (up from 384)

**Sections Updated:**
- **PROVENANCE NOTICE:** Updated to reference re-enrichment (42 EXT-*, 27 discoveries, convention unification). Score table updated with v3 scores for all 6 ODs. EXT-* Applied column added.
- **CONVERSATIONAL:** Score updated to 37/40 (v3). EXT-CONV-006 through 011 added to research provenance. R1-020/R1-028 added. Re-Enrichment Discoveries subsection added (zone tokens, opacity binary gate, convention inheritance).
- **NARRATIVE:** Score updated to 35/40 (v3). EXT-NARR-001 through 011 added. Density pairing expanded to 5-beat Freytag. Re-Enrichment Discoveries subsection added (Freytag 5-beat, progressive disclosure, RD-1 resolved).

# Research Package: OD-005 Spatial Re-Enrichment

**Generated:** 2026-02-09
**Agent:** researcher-2b
**Purpose:** Bespoke external research for OD-005 re-enrichment, evaluation of unapplied EXT-SPAT-006/007, cross-pollination with Wave 1 outputs, identity delta forward question resolution
**OD-005 Context:** Spatial Hub-Spoke, WAVE+ISLANDS density, Rank 2 (strong), 1,019 DOM elements, 251 thin border instances, 8 accessibility failures

---

## CHAIN TRAVERSAL

### Path Followed:
1. `OD-outbound-findings.md` (YAML: predecessor = `stage-2-density-dd/DD-outbound-findings.md`)
2. `DD-outbound-findings.md` (YAML: predecessor = `stage-1-components/component-findings.md`)
3. `OD-SYNTHESIS.md` (OD-005 = WAVE+ISLANDS, INCLUDE, Dialect B Functional, rank 2 in audit)
4. `OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md` (OD-005: 8 accessibility failures, most of all ODs; width fixed 960->860px; territory tile hover = HIGH spirit violation)
5. `EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md` (EXT-SPAT: 10 applied, 2 gaps -- 006/007 NOT defined)
6. `OD-005-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md` (12 resources surveyed: Resources 6 and 7 = CSS Grid Named Areas/SVG Maps and Breadcrumbs/Wayfinding)
7. `ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md` (full identity, 539 lines)
8. `identity-delta-wave1.md` (forward question: flat hover alternative for territory tiles)
9. `research-package-od-001.md` (cross-pollination: semi-transparent offsets = spirit violation, zone tokens = OD-F-005 embodiment)
10. `research-package-od-002.md` (cross-pollination: SOUL FAIL findings pattern = depth illusions, Freytag falling action = cognitive decompression)

### Emergent Insight:
The chain traversal reveals that OD-005 occupies a unique position: it is ranked 2nd in quality (per OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS) yet has the MOST accessibility failures (8) and a HIGH spirit violation (territory tile fake-lift hover). This creates a tension: the spatial pattern is conceptually strong but the implementation has the most issues. The 12-resource external research file (OD-005-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md) is the most comprehensive of all ODs, yet 2 findings (006/007) were never formalized. The traversal also reveals that EXT-SPAT-006 and EXT-SPAT-007 correspond to Resource 6 (CSS Grid Named Areas + SVG Maps) and Resource 7 (Breadcrumbs + Wayfinding) in the original research -- their content was APPLIED in OD-005 but never given formal EXT-SPAT IDs.

Additionally, the identity-delta-wave1.md forward question is critical: the `.territory-tile:hover { transform: translate(-4px,-4px) }` creates a fake-lift that is a HIGH spirit violation. Builder-1a's discovery that ANY departure from flat = spirit violation means the hover effect needs replacement, not just adjustment. Cross-pollinating with OD-002's research (research-package-od-002.md), the pattern of SOUL FAIL findings is 100% depth illusions -- rounded progress bars, gradient backgrounds, blur animations. The flat alternative must use ONLY color, border, and background changes.

### Queries Generated From Traversal:

1. Given OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) + DD-F-003 (ISLANDS) + EXT-SPAT-001 (Hub-and-Spoke ISLANDS): How do hub-spoke spatial documentation systems maintain WAVE density oscillation through hub-sparse/spoke-dense rhythm while preserving flat interactive feedback for territory navigation? (Chain: OD-F-005 -> DD-F-003 -> EXT-SPAT-001)

2. Given identity-delta-wave1.md forward question + EXT-CREATIVE-001 spirit violation + Soul Piece 4 (Shadows Lie About Depth): What flat hover interaction patterns create interactive feedback for grid tiles WITHOUT transform/translate depth illusion, using only border-color, background-color, or outline changes? (Chain: identity-delta -> EXT-CREATIVE-001 -> Soul Piece 4)

3. Given EXT-SPAT-008 (Screen Reader Accessibility) + OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS (8 accessibility failures) + CSS Spatial Navigation Level 1 spec: What keyboard-driven spatial navigation patterns exist for CSS Grid hub-spoke layouts that support arrow-key traversal between territory zones? (Chain: EXT-SPAT-008 -> audit -> W3C spec)

4. Given R2-1.5 (Whitespace as Content) + R2-2.3 (Dense but Breathable) + DD-F-003 (ISLANDS isolation): What spatial documentation patterns create breathable dense islands within a sparse hub-spoke framework, using whitespace as the primary density differentiator? (Chain: R2-1.5 -> R2-2.3 -> DD-F-003)

## EXT-SPAT-006/007 EVALUATION

### EXT-SPAT-006 Status: NOT FORMALLY DEFINED

**Original Research Source:** Resource 6 in OD-005-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md -- "CSS Grid Named Areas & SVG Interactive Maps" (Ahmad Shadeed, freeCodeCamp, CSS-Tricks)

**Content Already Applied:** The CSS Grid named areas technique IS applied in OD-005. The existing HTML uses `grid-template-areas` for the hub-spoke layout. SVG connection lines are implemented.

**Assessment:** EXT-SPAT-006 was never formalized as a finding because its content was organically absorbed into the OD-005 build. The techniques (named grid areas, SVG overlays) are implementation details, not conceptual findings. The R2-evaluation.md already covers CSS Grid applicability (R2-4.3, R2-4.5).

**Recommendation:** Do NOT create a retroactive EXT-SPAT-006 finding. The content is applied. Creating a retroactive ID would be provenance theater -- adding an ID to something already implemented without the ID.

### EXT-SPAT-007 Status: NOT FORMALLY DEFINED

**Original Research Source:** Resource 7 in OD-005-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md -- "UX Wayfinding Crash Course & Breadcrumb Patterns" (Progress, NN/G, W3C WAI)

**Content Already Applied:** OD-005 implements breadcrumbs with triangle separators (EXT-SPAT-002 covers this). The wayfinding principles (current location, available destinations, routes, return paths) are embedded in the hub-spoke navigation.

**Assessment:** Similar to EXT-SPAT-006, the content was absorbed without formalization. EXT-SPAT-002 (Breadcrumbs as WAVE Trigger) covers the breadcrumb portion. The four wayfinding questions (where am I, where can I go, how do I get there, how do I return) are architectural principles embedded in the design, not discrete findings.

**Recommendation:** Do NOT create a retroactive EXT-SPAT-007. The content is applied via EXT-SPAT-002 and the hub-spoke architecture itself. The gap in numbering reflects that not all researched resources produced distinct findings -- this is normal and does not indicate missing work.

**Summary:** Both EXT-SPAT-006 and EXT-SPAT-007 are phantom gaps -- the research was consumed, the techniques were applied, but the findings never warranted their own IDs. The 10 formalized EXT-SPAT findings accurately represent OD-005's external research contribution.

## SOUL PASS FINDINGS (for Builder)

### EXT-SPAT-013: Flat Hover Feedback via Border-Color Assertion

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-SPAT-013 |
| **Summary** | Interactive feedback for grid tiles/territory cards should use border-color change (e.g., `border-color: var(--color-primary)`) and/or background-color shift as the ONLY hover mechanism. Transform-based hover (translate, scale) creates depth illusion that violates Soul Piece 4. Border-color assertion communicates "this is interactive" without implying "this floats above the page." |
| **Application Guidance** | Replace `.territory-tile:hover { transform: translate(-4px,-4px) }` with `.territory-tile:hover { border-color: var(--color-primary); background-color: var(--color-border-subtle) }`. The border-color change from `--color-border` to `--color-primary` (#E83025) creates a strong, flat visual signal. The background shift from default to `--color-border-subtle` (#F0EBE3) adds a secondary signal without depth. Add `transition: border-color 0.15s, background-color 0.15s` for smooth feedback. This resolves the HIGH spirit violation flagged in OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS and identity-delta-wave1.md. |
| **Source URL** | https://thelinuxcode.com/css-hover-selector-in-2026-practical-patterns-pitfalls-and-accessible-interactions/ + https://www.stan.vision/journal/micro-interactions-2025-in-web-design |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS |
| **Gate 1 (Soul Pieces)** | PASS -- border-radius remains 0, box-shadow remains none, no depth illusion created. Border-color change is a 2D surface operation, not a 3D depth operation. |
| **Gate 2 (Locked Tokens)** | PASS -- Uses locked palette colors only (--color-primary #E83025, --color-border-subtle #F0EBE3). No off-palette values. |
| **Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns)** | PASS -- No 2px borders introduced (uses existing border width). No callout stacking. |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | SUPPORTS WAVE -- Hub tiles at rest = sparse visual weight (subtle border). Hub tiles on hover = slightly denser (red border + warm bg). The hover state does NOT change the density pattern, only the interactive affordance. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | PRODUCTIVE TENSION -- The Unhurried Editor is confident and static. Hover feedback implies responsiveness, which suggests eagerness. Resolution: the border-color assertion is CONFIDENT -- it says "I am here, interact with me" without begging for attention. The transition is minimal (0.15s) and the effect is understated. This is the editorial equivalent of a slight emphasis change, not a flashy call-to-action. |

**IDENTITY RESOLUTION FOR FORWARD QUESTION:**
The identity-delta-wave1.md asked: "What creates interactive feedback without depth illusion?" The answer: **border-color assertion**. The border changes color (flat, 2D), not position (depth, 3D). The element stays grounded on the same plane. This is consistent with builder-1a's discovery that "ANY departure from flat = spirit violation" -- border-color change IS flat. It changes the element's surface appearance without moving it in z-space. A secondary signal (background-color shift within locked palette) reinforces the interaction state.

### EXT-SPAT-014: CSS Spatial Navigation for Hub-Spoke Keyboard Traversal

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-SPAT-014 |
| **Summary** | CSS Spatial Navigation Level 1 (W3C draft) defines arrow-key-based focus movement between focusable elements based on spatial position. For hub-spoke grid layouts, this enables keyboard users to navigate territory tiles using arrow keys (left/right/up/down) rather than Tab sequencing. The `spatial-navigation-action: focus` property and `navigate()` JS method provide the interaction model. Even without native browser support, the PRINCIPLE -- that spatial layouts should support directional navigation matching their visual structure -- should inform OD-005's keyboard accessibility. |
| **Application Guidance** | OD-005 has 8 accessibility failures (most of all ODs). Implement a polyfill-style approach: (1) Add `tabindex="0"` to all territory tiles. (2) Add `role="grid"` to the territory grid container and `role="gridcell"` to each tile. (3) Add a JavaScript keydown handler that moves focus between tiles using arrow keys based on their grid position. (4) Visual focus indicator: `outline: 3px solid var(--color-primary); outline-offset: 2px` (no border-radius, uses locked palette). This addresses the accessibility gap while aligning with the W3C spatial navigation direction. |
| **Source URL** | https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nav-1/ + https://wicg.github.io/spatial-navigation/ |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS |
| **Gate 1 (Soul Pieces)** | PASS -- Focus outlines use `outline` (no border-radius needed). Grid/gridcell roles are semantic, not visual. No depth illusion. |
| **Gate 2 (Locked Tokens)** | PASS -- Focus color uses --color-primary (#E83025). Outline width 3px aligns with border conventions. |
| **Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns)** | PASS -- No anti-pattern match. Improves accessibility. |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | NEUTRAL -- Keyboard navigation is interaction-level, density-agnostic. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | NONE -- Accessibility is non-negotiable. The Unhurried Editor is for everyone. |

### EXT-SPAT-015: Breathable Islands via Three-Level Gestalt in Spatial Layouts

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-SPAT-015 |
| **Summary** | Cross-pollinating EXT-CONV-003 (Three-Level Gestalt Spacing from OD-001: 8px within / 32px between / 64px chapters) with OD-005's WAVE+ISLANDS density pairing. In spatial layouts, the three-level Gestalt creates breathable islands: (1) Within a territory spoke: 8px spacing between related content elements. (2) Between spokes/territory sections: 32px gap creating visible island isolation. (3) Between the hub overview and spoke content zones: 64px chapter-level breathing. This addresses OD-005's Dialect B classification (Functional, longest pages, most thin borders) by imposing the same spacing discipline that elevated OD-001 to Dialect A (Polished). |
| **Application Guidance** | Apply three-level Gestalt to OD-005's spatial layout: `--space-within: 8px` for elements within each spoke section (paragraphs, code blocks, callouts within a territory). `--space-between: 32px` for gaps between territory sections and between the hub map and the first spoke. `--space-chapter: 64px` for the major transition between the hub overview zone and the spoke content zone. This creates WAVE density: hub zone (64px chapter spacing = sparse) -> spoke zone (8px within-spacing = dense). The three levels ARE the WAVE rhythm in spatial form. |
| **Source URL** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-001.md (EXT-CONV-003) + R2-2.3 (Dense but Breathable) evaluation |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS |
| **Gate 1 (Soul Pieces)** | PASS -- Spacing changes, no visual soul implications. Strengthens Rule 6 (Whitespace as Design Element). |
| **Gate 2 (Locked Tokens)** | PASS -- Uses --space-2 (8px), --space-8 (32px), --space-16 (64px) from locked token system. |
| **Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns)** | PASS -- Directly prevents DD-F-017 (uniform density) by enforcing three-level spacing variation. |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | STRONGLY SUPPORTS -- Three-level Gestalt IS WAVE density in spatial form. The 64px hub/spoke transition IS the WAVE trough-to-crest boundary. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | NONE -- Whitespace discipline IS the Unhurried Editor's natural voice. |

### EXT-SPAT-016: Zone Tokens for Spatial Density Semantics

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-SPAT-016 |
| **Summary** | Cross-pollinating builder-1a's Discovery 3 from OD-001 (zone token naming reveals architecture): OD-005 should rename its spatial background tokens from container-specific names (--color-hub-bg, --color-spoke-bg, --color-transition-bg) to density-semantic names (--color-zone-sparse, --color-zone-dense, --color-zone-breathing). This embodies OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) at the token level: the hub IS the sparse zone, spokes ARE dense zones, transitions ARE breathing zones. The naming proves the finding -- spatial organization IS wave density. |
| **Application Guidance** | Replace in OD-005's :root block: `--color-hub-bg: #FEF9F5` -> `--color-zone-sparse: #FEF9F5`. `--color-spoke-bg: #FFFFFF` -> `--color-zone-dense: #FFFFFF`. `--color-transition-bg: #FAF5ED` -> `--color-zone-breathing: #FAF5ED`. Then update all CSS references. The actual color values DO NOT change -- only the names change. This is a semantic operation, not a visual one. It aligns OD-005 with the convention spec zone token naming established in Wave 1. |
| **Source URL** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-001.md (Builder Discovery 3: Zone Token Naming) |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS |
| **Gate 1 (Soul Pieces)** | PASS -- Token renaming, no visual change. |
| **Gate 2 (Locked Tokens)** | PASS -- Color values unchanged (#FEF9F5, #FFFFFF, #FAF5ED). Only custom property names change. |
| **Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns)** | PASS -- No anti-pattern match. |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | SUPPORTS -- Makes WAVE density explicit in token names. Hub=sparse, spoke=dense, transition=breathing. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | NONE -- Semantic naming IS editorial precision. |

### EXT-SPAT-017: Dark Header as Spatial Landmark Anchor

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-SPAT-017 |
| **Summary** | Cross-pollinating builder-1a's Discovery 2 (dark header convention changes page character) and builder-1b's Discovery 3 (convention spec header transform changes page identity): the dark header (#1A1A1A background, white text) serves as Kevin Lynch's PRIMARY LANDMARK in the spatial layout. Lynch's wayfinding theory (Resource 1 in OD-005-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md, already applied as EXT-SPAT-005) identifies landmarks as "easily identifiable reference points for orientation." The dark header is the most visually distinctive element on the page -- it IS the landmark. For OD-005's hub-spoke pattern, the dark header establishes the "you are at the hub" signal before the user even scrolls. |
| **Application Guidance** | Convert OD-005's light header to the convention spec dark header per OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md Section 4. Use `background: var(--color-text)` (#1A1A1A), white text, inner wrapper matching page container max-width. The dark header creates a CRESCENDO-inverse at page scale (per builder-1a): visually intense header (landmark) -> calm hub overview (sparse) -> dense spoke content (dense). This layering -- landmark anchor -> sparse navigation -> dense content -- IS the WAVE pattern in architectural form. |
| **Source URL** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-001.md (Builder Discovery 2) + research-package-od-002.md (Builder Discovery 3) + Kevin Lynch wayfinding theory (EXT-SPAT-005) |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS |
| **Gate 1 (Soul Pieces)** | PASS -- Uses locked palette (#1A1A1A background). Sharp edges. No shadows. |
| **Gate 2 (Locked Tokens)** | PASS -- All values from locked palette. |
| **Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns)** | PASS -- No anti-pattern match. |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | SUPPORTS -- Dark header + sparse hub + dense spokes = WAVE with landmark anchor. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | PRODUCTIVE TENSION -- The dark header is BOLD, which could conflict with "Unhurried." Resolution (per builder-1a): the boldness is typographic conviction, not decorative flamboyance. The Unhurried Editor opens with authority, then relaxes into content. |

---

### EXT-SPAT-018: Functional Animation as Wayfinding (Scroll-Driven WAVE Indicator)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-SPAT-018 |
| **Summary** | 2025-2026 design trends establish that "motion is less about visual flair and more about helping users understand what is happening on the screen" -- functional animation where movement supports clarity. For OD-005's spatial layout, a scroll-driven density indicator could visualize the WAVE pattern itself: as users scroll from hub (sparse) to spoke (dense), a subtle indicator shows the density shift. This would make OD-005's core hypothesis (hub-spoke IS WAVE) VISIBLE to the reader, similar to OD-002's tension meter (OD-F-011) but adapted for spatial density rather than narrative tension. |
| **Application Guidance** | Implement a CSS-only density indicator (similar to OD-001's scroll witness, EXT-CREATIVE-003) as a fixed sidebar element with rectangular markers (Soul Piece 5: squares signal system). Each marker represents a territory zone. The current zone's marker fills with --color-primary (#E83025) as the user scrolls into it. Implementation: `animation-timeline: scroll()` with `@keyframes fill` for each marker. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` with static fallback (all markers visible, current highlighted). Chromium-only with graceful degradation -- non-Chromium browsers see a static zone indicator. |
| **Source URL** | https://webpeak.org/blog/css-js-animation-trends/ + https://www.stan.vision/journal/micro-interactions-2025-in-web-design |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS |
| **Gate 1 (Soul Pieces)** | PASS -- Rectangular markers (Soul Piece 5). No border-radius. No box-shadow. No blur/gradient. |
| **Gate 2 (Locked Tokens)** | PASS -- Uses --color-primary for active marker, --color-border for inactive. |
| **Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns)** | PASS -- Minimal visual footprint, single element per zone, not callout stacking. |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | STRONGLY SUPPORTS -- The indicator VISUALIZES the WAVE pattern. Users can SEE the density rhythm as they navigate. This makes the core hypothesis (hub-spoke IS WAVE) empirically observable. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | PRODUCTIVE TENSION -- Scroll-driven animation is "web native" vs "magazine-like static editorial." Resolution (same as EXT-NARR-007 for OD-002): the indicator is PERSISTENT (like a magazine's section tab), not animated for entertainment. Progressive enhancement with prefers-reduced-motion fallback. |

## UNAPPLIED R-1 FINDINGS EVALUATION FOR OD-005

### R1-012: Permutation Strategy
**Applicability:** NOT APPLICABLE. Component variant documentation doesn't map to spatial hub-spoke.
**Verdict:** Skip.

### R1-014: Interactive Playground
**Applicability:** LOW. Code blocks within spoke content could be interactive, but OD-005's hypothesis is about spatial navigation, not code interaction.
**Verdict:** Defer to CD stage.

### R1-020: Four Pillars of Editorial
**Applicability:** HIGH. OD-005 has strong Layout (hub-spoke CSS Grid) and Typography (serif/sans hierarchy). Color is locked palette. Imagery is the gap -- the hub-spoke map visualization IS the imagery, but spoke content could use more diagrams. OD-005's 1,019 DOM elements suggest dense visual content, but per OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS the Dialect B classification means it lacks the Imagery pillar polish of Dialect A (OD-001/002).
**Application Guidance:** Add a system architecture diagram at the hub level showing the hub-spoke structure itself (meta-documentation). Use flat CSS/SVG, locked palette colors only.
**Soul Test:** SOUL PASS.

### R1-021: Code Snippet Best Practices
**Applicability:** MEDIUM. OD-005's spoke content contains code blocks. Line highlighting and copy buttons would strengthen spoke density.
**Verdict:** LOW priority -- code blocks are secondary to spatial navigation hypothesis.

### R1-023: Decision Matrix Layout
**Applicability:** CONDITIONALLY APPLICABLE. A comparison table showing "when to use spatial organization vs other patterns" could serve as a climax element in OD-005, similar to OD-002's Act III decision matrix (OD-F-013).
**Verdict:** LOW priority -- spatial pattern is self-evident, less need for comparison matrix.

### R1-024: Props/API Table Format
**Applicability:** NOT APPLICABLE.
**Verdict:** Skip.

### R1-027: Status Grouping
**Applicability:** NOT APPLICABLE.
**Verdict:** Skip.

### R1-028: WAI-ARIA Compliance
**Applicability:** HIGH. OD-005 has the MOST accessibility failures of all ODs (8 per audit). ARIA compliance is critical. Add `role="grid"` to territory grid, `role="gridcell"` to tiles, `aria-label` to all spatial sections, skip links for territory navigation.
**Application Guidance:** See EXT-SPAT-014 above -- the spatial navigation finding addresses this comprehensively.
**Soul Test:** SOUL PASS.

### R-1 Summary for OD-005:
- **APPLICABLE (2):** R1-020 (Four Pillars), R1-028 (WAI-ARIA)
- **CONDITIONALLY APPLICABLE (2):** R1-021, R1-023
- **NOT APPLICABLE (4):** R1-012, R1-014, R1-024, R1-027

## R-2 CROSS-REFERENCE (from r2-evaluation.md)

OD-005 has the MOST applicable R-2 findings (16 out of 25 SOUL PASS). Key HIGH priority from r2-evaluation.md:

| R-2 Finding | Priority | Application |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| R2-1.5 (Whitespace as Content) | HIGH | Validates Rule 6, breathable islands |
| R2-5.2 (Whitespace for Hierarchy) | HIGH | 1.5x heading proximity rule |
| R2-5.3 (Typographic Hierarchy) | HIGH | Responsive clamp-based sizing |

These are already evaluated. Builder should consult r2-evaluation.md Section "For OD-005" directly.

## SOUL FAIL FINDINGS (documentation only, DO NOT APPLY)

### SOUL FAIL 1: Transform-Based Hover Lift (Current OD-005 Implementation)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | Current OD-005: `.territory-tile:hover { transform: translate(-4px,-4px) }` |
| **What it does** | Translates tile upward and leftward on hover, creating a "lifting off the page" illusion |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 1 FAIL -- Contradicts Soul Piece 4 (Shadows Lie About Depth / everything grounded on same plane). Transform-translate creates a perceptual depth shift even without box-shadow. The tile appears to "float" above its neighbors. |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | ANY departure from flat = spirit violation (per builder-1a's identity refinement in Wave 1). Transform-translate on hover is functionally equivalent to box-shadow: both create the illusion that an element exists at a different z-depth than its neighbors. The soul says "everything is GROUNDED on the same plane." A tile that moves when hovered is no longer grounded. |

### SOUL FAIL 2: Scale-Up Hover Effect (Common Alternative)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | Common CSS hover pattern: `transform: scale(1.05)` |
| **What it does** | Enlarges the tile slightly on hover |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 1 FAIL -- Scale creates implicit depth hierarchy (larger = closer to viewer = floating). While less severe than translate, it still violates the "same plane" principle. The enlarged tile overlaps its neighbors' visual space, creating a z-order impression. |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | Scale hover effects are "depth lite" -- they create a subtler depth illusion than translate but still violate the flat design principle. The soul test question applies: "Squint at the page. Do some elements pop forward?" A scaled-up tile pops forward. |

### SOUL FAIL 3: CSS Perspective/3D Transforms

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | Various CSS card hover tutorials: `transform: perspective(500px) rotateY(5deg)` |
| **What it does** | Creates a 3D rotation effect on hover |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 1 FAIL -- Explicit 3D transformation. Soul Piece 4 violation. Gate 2 FAIL -- requires z-depth properties not in locked tokens. |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | Obviously violates flat design. Included for completeness to document the full gradient of depth illusion techniques that are prohibited. |

---

## SOUL FAIL SUMMARY

| Count | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| 3 rejected | All involve transform-based hover effects that create depth/z-position illusion |
| Pattern | 100% of SOUL FAIL findings involve MOVEMENT that implies the element exists at a different z-depth than its neighbors |
| Lesson | Hover feedback must change SURFACE PROPERTIES (color, border-color, background-color) not SPATIAL PROPERTIES (position, scale, rotation). The element stays on the same plane; only its appearance changes. |

---

## SURPRISING FINDINGS

### Surprising 1: EXT-SPAT-006/007 Are Phantom Gaps, Not Missing Research

The chain traversal revealed that EXT-SPAT-006 and EXT-SPAT-007 (flagged in EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md and OD-REENRICHMENT-SPECIFICATION.md as "not applied, evaluate for re-enrichment") are NOT missing findings. They correspond to Resources 6 (CSS Grid Named Areas/SVG) and 7 (Breadcrumbs/Wayfinding) in OD-005-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md. The content WAS applied in OD-005 -- the CSS Grid named areas ARE the hub-spoke layout, and the breadcrumb system IS implemented. They simply never received formal EXT-SPAT IDs because their contribution was architectural (implementation technique) rather than conceptual (design finding). Creating retroactive IDs would be provenance theater. This resolves the evaluation requirement without creating false findings.

### Surprising 2: The Border-Color Assertion IS the Flat Alternative to ALL Depth-Based Hover Effects

The identity-delta forward question asked specifically about OD-005's territory-tile hover. But the answer generalizes: border-color assertion is the universal flat alternative to ANY depth-based hover effect across ALL ODs. OD-006 also has `.territory-tile:hover { transform: translate(-2px,-2px) }` (MEDIUM severity). The same border-color solution applies. This is a SYSTEMIC fix, not an OD-005-specific one. Builder should apply EXT-SPAT-013 to OD-005 AND flag the same fix for OD-006's Wave 3 re-enrichment.

### Surprising 3: CSS Spatial Navigation Spec Validates OD-005's Architecture

The W3C CSS Spatial Navigation Level 1 specification (still a draft, but with active interest from Samsung, LG, and TV/embedded browser vendors) describes EXACTLY the navigation model OD-005 needs: arrow-key traversal between grid cells based on spatial position. OD-005's territory grid is not just a visual layout -- it is a spatial navigation surface. The spec's `spatial-navigation-action: focus` property and the "grid" algorithm option were designed for exactly this use case. Even though the spec isn't widely implemented yet, OD-005 can implement the PRINCIPLE with a simple JS keydown handler, positioning it as forward-compatible with the W3C direction.

### Surprising 4: Three-Level Gestalt IS WAVE in Spatial Form

Cross-pollinating EXT-CONV-003 (from OD-001) with OD-005's spatial layout reveals that the three-level Gestalt spacing (8px/32px/64px) directly maps to the WAVE density pattern: 64px = WAVE trough (breathing between hub and spokes), 32px = WAVE transition (between spoke sections), 8px = WAVE crest (within dense spoke content). This is the SAME discovery as OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) but applied to SPACING -- spacing IS density IS organization. The three are the same phenomenon at different levels of abstraction.

## CROSS-POLLINATION NOTES

### From research-package-od-001.md:
- **Discovery 1 (Semi-Transparent Offsets):** OD-005 does NOT have semi-transparent offset pseudo-elements. No action needed.
- **Discovery 2 (Dark Header):** APPLICABLE -- converted to EXT-SPAT-017.
- **Discovery 3 (Zone Token Naming):** APPLICABLE -- converted to EXT-SPAT-016.
- **Discovery 4 (5% Question Margin):** NOT APPLICABLE -- OD-005 doesn't use Q&A width variation.
- **Discovery 5 (Convention Spec Type Scale):** APPLICABLE -- OD-005 should adopt convention spec type scale. Builder can apply directly from OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md.

### From research-package-od-002.md:
- **SOUL FAIL pattern (depth illusions):** DIRECTLY APPLICABLE -- validates that OD-005's territory-tile hover is a spirit violation (same category as OD-002's rejected rounded progress bars, gradient backgrounds, blur animations).
- **Freytag's falling action (cognitive decompression):** PARTIALLY APPLICABLE -- OD-005 doesn't have a narrative arc, but the principle of "cognitive decompression after dense content" applies to spoke-to-hub return. After dense spoke content, the return to the sparse hub should feel like a deliberate exhale, not an abrupt cut.
- **EXT-NARR-008 Four Pillars gap:** Cross-reference -- OD-005 also has an Imagery pillar gap (per R1-020 evaluation above).
- **SURPRISE-1 (Progressive Disclosure = Narrative Arc):** Interesting cross-connection -- in OD-005's spatial layout, NAVIGATION IS progressive disclosure. Clicking from hub (overview) to spoke (detail) IS progressive disclosure in spatial form. This extends OD-F-005 further: Organization IS Density IS Progressive Disclosure IS Navigation.

### Re-evaluation of SOUL FAIL findings from OD-002 against OD-005's WAVE+ISLANDS:
- **SOUL-FAIL-001 (Rounded Progress Bars):** Still FAIL for OD-005. Any density indicator must use rectangular markers.
- **SOUL-FAIL-002 (Gradient Backgrounds):** Still FAIL. Transition between hub and spoke should use flat color shift (#FEF9F5 -> #FFFFFF), not gradient.
- **SOUL-FAIL-003 (Animated Text Reveals with Blur):** Still FAIL. If scroll-driven reveal is used, opacity+translateY only (per EXT-CREATIVE-004).

## PRIORITY ENRICHMENT ACTIONS FOR BUILDER (ordered by impact):

1. **FIX territory-tile hover** -- Remove `transform: translate(-4px,-4px)`, replace with border-color + background-color assertion (EXT-SPAT-013). This resolves the HIGH spirit violation. HIGHEST PRIORITY.
2. **Apply dark header convention** -- Convert light header to dark per convention spec (EXT-SPAT-017). Establishes spatial landmark anchor.
3. **Rename zone tokens** -- Hub-bg/spoke-bg/transition-bg -> zone-sparse/zone-dense/zone-breathing (EXT-SPAT-016). Semantic alignment with OD-F-005.
4. **Apply three-level Gestalt spacing** -- 8px/32px/64px for within/between/chapter (EXT-SPAT-015). Creates breathable WAVE rhythm.
5. **Add keyboard spatial navigation** -- Grid role + arrow-key handler for territory tiles (EXT-SPAT-014). Addresses accessibility gap.
6. **Add WAVE density indicator** -- Scroll-driven sidebar showing current zone (EXT-SPAT-018). Makes WAVE hypothesis visible.
7. **Apply R1-020** -- Add hub-level architecture diagram (Imagery pillar gap).
8. **Apply R1-028** -- ARIA landmarks and skip links for all spatial sections.

## BUILDER DISCOVERIES (appended by builder-2b, 2026-02-09)

### Discovery 1: The Solid Offset Pseudo-Element Must Stay Static on Hover

The original territory-tile had a hover animation that moved both the tile AND its `::after` solid-offset pseudo-element (tile translates up-left, `::after` moves to top:0/left:0). This created a synchronized "lift" animation that amplified the depth illusion. The fix was NOT just removing `transform: translate()` from the tile -- the `::after` hover state also had to be removed. A static solid offset is a flat graphic (acceptable). An animated solid offset that syncs with tile movement IS a depth animation (spirit violation). The distinction: static offset = graphic device. Animated offset = physics simulation.

### Discovery 2: Dark Header on Spatial Layout Creates Stronger Landmark Than on Q&A

When the convention spec dark header was applied to OD-005, the effect was more pronounced than expected. In OD-001 (conversational), the dark header establishes authority but the Q&A content immediately takes over. In OD-005 (spatial), the dark header creates a Kevin Lynch LANDMARK effect: users orient themselves against the dark header as "home base" before navigating into spoke content. The sparse hub directly below the dark header creates a strong visual decompression: dark-dense header -> light-sparse hub -> dense-spoke content. This three-phase density cascade (landmark -> breathing -> content) is more dramatic than the two-phase cascade in conversational layouts.

### Discovery 3: WAVE Density Indicator Makes the Hypothesis Self-Documenting

The EXT-SPAT-018 wave indicator (fixed sidebar rectangles) transforms OD-005 from "a page that demonstrates WAVE density" to "a page that SHOWS you its own WAVE density in real time." As you scroll from hub to spoke, the indicator rectangle fills with red. The indicator IS the meta-documentation: it proves the hypothesis (hub-sparse/spoke-dense) by visualizing the density shift as you experience it. This is the first OD exploration where the core hypothesis is empirically visible to the reader rather than described in text.

### Discovery 4: Keyboard Spatial Navigation Validates the Hub-Spoke Metaphor

Adding arrow-key navigation to the territory grid (EXT-SPAT-014) revealed that the hub-spoke pattern IS spatial in a way that keyboard navigation proves. Users can arrow between tiles left/right/up/down based on grid position. This is not possible in linear layouts (OD-001, OD-002) where Tab is the only navigation model. The spatial pattern's uniqueness is validated by the fact that it supports a fundamentally different interaction model. This should inform AD work: axis layouts for spatial patterns must preserve the 2D grid navigability.

### Discovery 5: Zone Token Renaming Reveals Architectural Intent More Than Expected

Renaming `--color-hub-bg` to `--color-zone-sparse` (EXT-SPAT-016) did more than prove OD-F-005. It made the CSS itself read like a density specification. Reading the CSS comment "Zone backgrounds (PULSE / WAVE differentiation)" with tokens named `zone-sparse/zone-dense/zone-breathing` immediately communicates that this is a density-aware layout. The old names (hub-bg/spoke-bg/transition-bg) communicated spatial architecture but hid the density dimension. The new names communicate both: "zone" = spatial, "sparse/dense/breathing" = density. This dual-semantic naming should be the standard for all future ODs.

### Discovery 6: Comprehensive Reduced-Motion Rule Supersedes Per-Component Rules (Iteration 2)

The convention spec's comprehensive `prefers-reduced-motion` rule (`*, *::before, *::after { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; ... }`) makes per-component reduced-motion rules redundant. OD-005 had separate reduced-motion rules for scroll reveal animations and the wave indicator. Replacing both with the single comprehensive rule from the convention spec reduces CSS complexity and ensures no future interactive addition can accidentally bypass the accessibility preference. The comprehensive rule is a "prophylactic" approach (per metacognition analysis): it prevents failure by making compliance the default, not the exception. All future ODs should use this single-rule approach.

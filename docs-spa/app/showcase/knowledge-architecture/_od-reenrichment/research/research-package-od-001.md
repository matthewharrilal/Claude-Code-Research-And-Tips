# Research Package: OD-001 Conversational Re-Enrichment

**Generated:** 2026-02-08
**Agent:** researcher-1a
**Purpose:** Bespoke external research for OD-001 re-enrichment, plus evaluation of unapplied R-1 findings

## CHAIN TRAVERSAL

### Path Followed:
1. `OD-outbound-findings.md` (YAML frontmatter: predecessor = `stage-2-density-dd/DD-outbound-findings.md`)
2. `DD-outbound-findings.md` (YAML frontmatter: predecessor = `stage-1-components/component-findings.md`)
3. `OD-SYNTHESIS.md` (BUILT ON table -> OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md, DD-outbound-findings.md)
4. `OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md` (3-quality-dialect ranking: OD-001 = rank 3 out of 6, STRONG)
5. `HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md` (successor to OD-outbound-findings.md, mandatory R-2 evaluation flagged)
6. `ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md` (full identity context, 539 lines)

### Emergent Insight:
The chain reveals that OD-001 sits at an interesting intersection: it is ranked 3rd in quality (per OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS Section 8), yet it was the FIRST OD built and the ONLY one to receive v2 enrichment. The audit identified semi-transparent offset pseudo-elements (EXT-CREATIVE-001) as a HIGH spirit violation unique to OD-001. The dialect gap between Polished (OD-001/002) and Functional (OD-003-005) means OD-001's enrichment style IS the quality bar that other ODs failed to reach. Re-enrichment must deepen OD-001's existing strengths without introducing new spirit violations.

### Queries Generated From Traversal:
1. Given OD-F-003 (Q&A IS PULSE) + DD-F-001 (PULSE rhythm) + OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density): How do conversational interfaces in premium documentation maintain PULSE density without explicit manipulation? (Chain: OD-F-003 -> DD-F-001 -> OD-F-005)
2. Given OD-F-001 (width variation TIDAL) + DD-F-005 (width = inverse density) + EXT-CONV-005 (responsive TIDAL choreography): What width-ratio research exists for Q&A containers that maintains readability across viewport sizes? (Chain: OD-F-001 -> DD-F-005 -> EXT-CONV-005)
3. Given OD-F-002 (fractal nesting follow-ups) + DD-F-006 (fractal at 4 scales) + EXT-CONV-001 (Socratic narrowing): What progressive narrowing patterns exist in conversational documentation that satisfy fractal self-similarity? (Chain: OD-F-002 -> DD-F-006 -> EXT-CONV-001)

## SOUL PASS FINDINGS (for Builder)

### EXT-CONV-006: Hourglass Conversational Architecture

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-CONV-006 |
| **Summary** | Socratic dialogue follows an "hourglass" structure: broad universal question -> narrow particular case -> broad universal answer. This maps to density: sparse (universal) -> dense (particular) -> sparse (resolution). |
| **Application Guidance** | OD-001 already uses Socratic progressive narrowing (EXT-CONV-001). Strengthen by making the hourglass structure EXPLICIT at section scale: each chapter opens with a broad philosophical question (sparse), narrows through specific implementation detail (dense), and resolves with a universal principle (sparse). This creates PULSE at the section scale, satisfying DD-F-006 fractal. |
| **Source URL** | https://mspguide.org/2022/03/18/socratic-dialogue/ |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (no soul contradiction), Gate 2 (no locked token violation), Gate 3 (no anti-pattern match) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | SUPPORTS OD-001's PULSE + TIDAL pairing. The hourglass IS PULSE at section scale. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | None. Extends Socratic narrowing naturally. |

---

### EXT-CONV-007: Rhythm Through Repetition (Visual Hierarchy Principle)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-CONV-007 |
| **Summary** | Visual rhythm is created by repeating elements in a pattern -- the guiding beat that prevents users from getting lost. In conversational Q&A, the question marker + question text + answer block pattern ITSELF is the repeating element that creates rhythm. The repetition of the Q&A structural pattern IS the rhythm device. |
| **Application Guidance** | Given OD-F-003 (Q&A IS PULSE generator), ensure the visual markers of Q&A transitions (question markers, background shifts, width changes) are consistent enough to establish rhythm but varied enough to prevent monotony. Apply: consistent 8px square question markers + consistent background shift (EXT-CONV-004 already applied) + consistent width shift (60%/100%). The three visual signals compound into a recognizable beat. |
| **Source URL** | https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/design-principles-compositional-flow-and-rhythm/ |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (reinforces Soul Piece 5 -- squares signal system), Gate 2 (no token violation), Gate 3 (no anti-pattern) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | SUPPORTS PULSE. Rhythm IS pulse -- the repetition of Q(sparse)->A(dense) is the beat. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | None. |

---

### EXT-CONV-008: Staged Disclosure for Nested Follow-ups

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-CONV-008 |
| **Summary** | Staged disclosure (IxDF/NNGroup) moves users from abstract to specific through a predefined linear sequence, revealing only a fraction of information at each stage. In conversational Q&A, this maps to follow-up depth: Level 1 (top-level Q&A) shows the abstract answer; Level 2 (follow-up) reveals specific implementation; Level 3 (nested follow-up) shows edge cases. Max 2 levels of disclosure (per EXT-DENSITY-002). |
| **Application Guidance** | OD-001 already has follow-up questions (OD-F-002). Strengthen by ensuring follow-ups use `<details>` for depth-on-demand disclosure. Top-level Q&A visible by default. Follow-up Q&A collapsed. This satisfies DD-F-006 fractal at section scale: the same Q&A pattern repeats within itself. The progressive disclosure is abstract->specific, matching Socratic narrowing. Enforce max 2 nesting levels (EXT-DENSITY-002 constraint). |
| **Source URL** | https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (no contradiction), Gate 2 (no token violation), Gate 3 (no anti-pattern match -- max 2 levels prevents callout cacophony) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | SUPPORTS. Nested follow-ups create PULSE at component scale (collapsed=sparse, expanded=dense). |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | Productive tension: depth-on-demand trades initial simplicity for discoverable complexity. The "Unhurried Editor" identity says trust the reader's intelligence -- progressive disclosure RESPECTS that by not dumbing down, while still providing a clean initial view. |

---

### EXT-CONV-009: Information Architecture Trends 2026 -- Conversational IA

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-CONV-009 |
| **Summary** | 2026 IA trend: information architects must structure content for conversational flow, anticipating natural language question patterns rather than keyword hierarchies. Voice search is moving toward natural language. Documentation structured as conversation aligns with this IA trend -- users already think in Q&A format. |
| **Application Guidance** | OD-001 is already conversational. Strengthen by ensuring question phrasing matches natural language patterns (how users would actually search for this information). Questions should be "How do I..." / "What happens when..." / "Why does..." rather than "Section: Configuration" or "Topic: Setup." This makes OD-001 future-compatible with conversational search interfaces. |
| **Source URL** | https://slickplan.com/blog/information-architecture-trends |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (no contradiction), Gate 2 (no token violation), Gate 3 (no anti-pattern) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | Neutral. Content-level guideline, density-agnostic. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | None. Natural language questions align with editorial conversational voice. |

---

### EXT-CONV-010: Flowing Rhythm in Layout (Wave Analogy)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-CONV-010 |
| **Summary** | A flowing rhythm has repeated elements that follow bends or curves, like ocean waves. In layout, this means elements should have a recognizable pattern with organic variation -- not strict identical repetition. For Q&A conversational layouts, the TIDAL width variation (60%/100%) creates this flowing rhythm: questions narrow like retreating water, answers spread like advancing waves. |
| **Application Guidance** | OD-001 already uses TIDAL width variation (OD-F-001). Strengthen by making the width transition MORE fluid -- consider CSS transitions on max-width during scroll-driven reveal (EXT-CREATIVE-004 already applies arriving wisdom). The question width could use a slight indent (`margin-left: 8%` alongside `max-width: 60%`) to create asymmetry that reinforces the tidal metaphor. This satisfies DD-F-005 (TIDAL: width = inverse density). |
| **Source URL** | https://www.lullabot.com/articles/designing-rhythm-and-proportion |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (no contradiction), Gate 2 (no token violation -- margin-left doesn't violate any locked token), Gate 3 (no anti-pattern) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | STRONGLY SUPPORTS TIDAL. The flowing rhythm metaphor directly maps to TIDAL density variation. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | Slight tension: the "Unhurried Editor" is authoritative and static. Wave-like flowing rhythm implies movement. Resolution: the flow is in the READER's experience (scrolling through), not in the layout itself. The layout is static; the rhythm emerges during reading. |

---

### EXT-CONV-011: Bold Minimalism 2026 -- Typography as Architecture

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-CONV-011 |
| **Summary** | 2026 graphic design trend "Bold Minimalism" takes clean, structured foundations and injects contrast, character, and attitude. Typography-only hero sections get increasing adoption. Sharp edges, clean lines, and utilitarian precision characterize the aesthetic. This validates and extends the KortAI soul's editorial identity with contemporary support. |
| **Application Guidance** | OD-001's chapter openings could leverage bold minimalism more aggressively: larger chapter titles (using EXT-CREATIVE-002 typographic cascade), editorial drop caps (EXT-CREATIVE-005 already applied), and MORE contrast between question typography (Instrument Serif italic, large) and answer typography (Inter, standard). The typographic CASCADE from question to answer IS the visual hierarchy -- no decoration needed. |
| **Source URL** | https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/forward-thinking-graphic-trends-2026-graphic-design-120126 |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (STRENGTHENS Soul Piece 1 -- sharp edges, and Soul Piece 2 -- serif=wisdom), Gate 2 (no token violation), Gate 3 (no anti-pattern) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | SUPPORTS. Bold typography in questions (sparse zone) creates strong visual contrast with dense answer zones. The typography size differential AMPLIFIES the PULSE perception. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | PRODUCTIVE TENSION: "Bold" is not the same as "Unhurried." The Unhurried Editor has nothing to prove -- but bold minimalism DOES make a statement. Resolution: the boldness is in the TYPOGRAPHIC CONVICTION, not in decorative flamboyance. A serif drop cap IS bold AND unhurried. |

## UNAPPLIED R-1 FINDINGS EVALUATION FOR OD-001

### R1-012: Permutation Strategy (Finding 4.2)
**Description:** One story per significant variant -- Button/Primary, Button/Secondary, etc.
**Applicability to OD-001:** NOT APPLICABLE. R1-012 is about component showcases (Storybook pattern). OD-001 is an organizational exploration demonstrating conversational Q&A, not a component variant showcase. The concept of "permutations" doesn't map to Q&A organizational patterns.
**Verdict:** Skip for OD-001. More applicable to CD (combination) stage.

### R1-014: Interactive Playground (Finding 4.4)
**Description:** Live code editors with real-time preview -- edit, preview, reset, fork.
**Applicability to OD-001:** PARTIALLY APPLICABLE. OD-001 contains code blocks within answers. An interactive playground could enhance the code examples, letting readers edit and run them. However, OD-001's hypothesis is about CONVERSATIONAL ORGANIZATION, not interactive code. Adding a playground would shift focus away from the organizational pattern being tested.
**Verdict:** LOW priority. Could be applied as an enhancement to code blocks within answers but should not distract from the Q&A organizational hypothesis. Defer to CD stage where component interactions are the focus.

### R1-020: Four Pillars of Editorial (Finding 5.5)
**Description:** Layout + Typography + Color + Imagery must unite in editorial design.
**Applicability to OD-001:** APPLICABLE. OD-001 already achieves Layout (Q&A with width variation), Typography (Instrument Serif/Inter/JetBrains hierarchy), and Color (locked palette with background differentiation). Imagery is the gap -- OD-001 uses the density visualization panel but could benefit from more diagrammatic content illustrating the conversational flow pattern itself.
**Application Guidance for Builder:** Consider adding a simple diagram at the chapter level showing the Q->A->Q->A PULSE flow, using only locked palette colors and flat design (no drop shadows, no gradients). A simple ASCII-art or CSS-only diagram showing the width variation pattern would satisfy R1-020 without violating soul.
**Soul Test:** SOUL PASS. Diagrams using flat design and locked palette colors do not violate any gate.

### R1-021: Code Snippet Best Practices (Finding 6.1)
**Description:** Syntax highlighting + copy button + language tabs + line highlighting (Stripe pattern).
**Applicability to OD-001:** APPLICABLE. OD-001 v2 already has code blocks with syntax highlighting. Line highlighting and language tabs could strengthen the code sections within answers. However, OD-001's code blocks are pedagogical (teaching React Server Components), not reference (API docs). The Stripe pattern (multi-language tabs, user API keys) is overly complex for tutorial code.
**Application Guidance for Builder:** Apply selectively: line highlighting for the specific lines being discussed in the answer. Skip multi-language tabs (irrelevant for RSC tutorial). Copy button already present. Line numbers already present.
**Soul Test:** SOUL PASS. Syntax highlighting and line numbers are soul-neutral.

### R1-023: Decision Matrix Layout (Finding 6.3)
**Description:** Options x Criteria grid with visual scoring for decisions.
**Applicability to OD-001:** CONDITIONALLY APPLICABLE. OD-001 doesn't currently contain a decision point. However, a decision matrix could be added as a climax element (per OD-F-013: decision matrices as natural climax). For OD-001, a decision matrix comparing "When to use conversational organization" vs other OD patterns could serve as the final chapter's summary.
**Application Guidance for Builder:** If a decision matrix is added, place it at the END of OD-001 as a chapter-closing summary. Use the established table styling (horizontal rules only, no vertical borders per anti-pattern registry). This creates a natural CRESCENDO end to the PULSE pattern.
**Soul Test:** SOUL PASS. Tables with horizontal rules only, no rounded corners, locked palette.

### R1-024: Props/API Table Format (Finding 6.4)
**Description:** Name | Type | Required | Default | Description format for component APIs.
**Applicability to OD-001:** NOT APPLICABLE. OD-001 is an organizational exploration, not a component API reference. Props tables don't map to Q&A organizational content.
**Verdict:** Skip for OD-001. Applicable to CD stage.

### R1-027: Status Grouping (Finding 7.3)
**Description:** Organize components by maturity status (Production Ready / Experimental / Deprecated).
**Applicability to OD-001:** NOT APPLICABLE. OD-001 demonstrates an organizational pattern, not a component gallery. Status grouping is relevant to the overall showcase, not to individual OD explorations.
**Verdict:** Skip for OD-001. Applicable to Migration/showcase-level work.

### R1-028: WAI-ARIA Compliance Callout (Finding 7.4)
**Description:** Dedicated accessibility section per component documenting ARIA attributes, keyboard nav, focus management.
**Applicability to OD-001:** APPLICABLE (already partially addressed). OD-001 v2 fix phase added skip-to-content links, focus-visible styles, and prefers-reduced-motion. However, there is no DEDICATED accessibility section in OD-001. Adding one would demonstrate that conversational organization supports accessible navigation (semantic HTML, ARIA landmarks for Q&A regions, keyboard tab through questions).
**Application Guidance for Builder:** Consider adding ARIA attributes to Q&A sections: `role="region"` with `aria-label` for each Q&A pair, or semantic `<article>` wrapping. Add `aria-expanded` to collapsible follow-up `<details>` elements. Document keyboard navigation pattern: Tab through questions, Enter to expand follow-ups.
**Soul Test:** SOUL PASS. Accessibility attributes are soul-neutral. Adding them strengthens the exploration's production quality.

### Unapplied R-1 Summary for OD-001

| Finding | Verdict | Priority for Builder |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| R1-012 (Permutation) | NOT APPLICABLE | -- |
| R1-014 (Interactive Playground) | LOW priority | Defer |
| R1-020 (Four Pillars) | APPLICABLE | MEDIUM -- add diagram |
| R1-021 (Code Snippets) | APPLICABLE | LOW -- line highlighting |
| R1-023 (Decision Matrix) | CONDITIONALLY APPLICABLE | LOW -- if climax added |
| R1-024 (Props Table) | NOT APPLICABLE | -- |
| R1-027 (Status Grouping) | NOT APPLICABLE | -- |
| R1-028 (WAI-ARIA) | APPLICABLE | MEDIUM -- ARIA attributes |

**Applicable count:** 4 of 8 (R1-020, R1-021, R1-023, R1-028)
**Recommended for builder:** R1-020 and R1-028 (medium priority); R1-021 and R1-023 (low priority)

## SOUL FAIL FINDINGS (documentation only, DO NOT APPLY)

### SOUL FAIL 1: Card Manipulation and Animation (from R2, 6.4)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | R2 Finding 6.4: Card Manipulation and Animation |
| **What it proposes** | Cards that respond to interaction beyond hover -- liquid glass aesthetic, tactile shadows, 3D details, drag-and-drop reordering |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 1 FAIL (contradicts Soul Piece 4 -- shadows lie about depth), Gate 2 FAIL (requires box-shadow, border-radius > 0 for "liquid glass"), Gate 3 FAIL (matches anti-pattern: Hover Lift Effects) |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | Every aspect of this finding contradicts KortAI's soul: liquid glass = shadows + blur + rounded corners. Tactile shadows = box-shadow. 3D details = fake depth. Drag-and-drop = treats content like interactive objects rather than editorial content. |

### SOUL FAIL 2: Overlapping/Layered Elements with Z-Index (from R2, 6.2)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | R2 Finding 6.2: Overlapping Elements |
| **What it proposes** | CSS Grid + z-index for intentional overlapping, text overlaying images, decorative elements enhancing content |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 1 FAIL (contradicts Soul Piece 4 -- flat design, everything grounded on same plane). Overlapping creates implicit depth hierarchy. Gate 3 FAIL (matches anti-pattern: Decorative Grid Breaking) |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | Overlapping elements create a visual depth hierarchy that contradicts the flat design principle. Nothing should float; everything is grounded on the same plane. |

### SOUL FAIL 3: Golden Ratio Typography Scale (from R2, 4.4)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | R2 Finding 4.4: Golden Ratio Grid System -- typography application |
| **What it proposes** | Type scale based on 1:1.618 ratio: 16px -> 26px -> 42px |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 2 FAIL. The locked type scale uses a ~1.5x ratio (EXT-CREATIVE-002), not 1.618x. The golden ratio values (26px, 42px) diverge from locked scale values (24px, 40px). NOTE: the grid layout proportions (61.8%/38.2%) PASS -- only the typography values fail. |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | Type scale is locked. Any deviation from EXT-CREATIVE-002's 1.5x ratio introduces off-scale values that create the same inconsistency flagged in EXT-CREATIVE-002 spirit violation. |

---

## SOUL FAIL SUMMARY

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total findings evaluated | 6 new EXT-CONV + 8 unapplied R-1 + 27 R-2 (see r2-evaluation.md) |
| SOUL PASS (for builder) | 6 new EXT-CONV findings |
| SOUL FAIL (excluded) | 3 findings documented above |
| Pattern of what fails | Depth illusions (shadows, overlapping, z-index layering), decoration-over-content, and off-scale typography values |

---

## SURPRISING FINDINGS

### Surprising 1: The Hourglass IS the Fractal
EXT-CONV-006 reveals that Socratic dialogue's "hourglass" shape (broad->narrow->broad) is LITERALLY DD-F-006 fractal self-similarity applied to conversational structure. The hourglass pattern at page scale (opening question broad -> specific implementation -> universal conclusion) repeats at section scale (chapter question -> detail -> chapter summary) and at component scale (follow-up question -> nested answer -> return to main thread). This was NOT in the compiled identity -- it's a novel connection between two independently documented patterns (Socratic Method from EXT-CONV-001 and Fractal from DD-F-006).

### Surprising 2: Bold Minimalism Validates KortAI's Soul Post-Hoc
EXT-CONV-011 shows that 2026 design trends are moving TOWARD what KortAI already is -- sharp edges, flat design, typography-dominant, utilitarian precision. The soul was "discovered" through perceptual deepening in late 2025/early 2026, and the broader design industry is independently converging on the same aesthetic. This suggests the soul is not arbitrary but reflects a genuine design zeitgeist.

### Surprising 3: Conversational IA is an Industry Trend
EXT-CONV-009 shows that information architecture is moving toward conversational structures for navigation and content discovery. OD-001's conversational organization is not just an experimental pattern -- it aligns with a mainstream IA evolution toward natural-language-structured content. This elevates OD-001 from "one of six explorations" to "the most industry-aligned exploration."

## BUILDER DISCOVERIES (appended by builder-1a during v3 re-enrichment)

### Discovery 1: Semi-Transparent Offsets Were More Pervasive Than Expected

**Expected:** The research package flagged 2 instances of semi-transparent offset pseudo-elements (callout-essence at 0.15, code-block at 0.3).
**Found:** There was a THIRD instance: `.essence-pullquote::after` also had `opacity: 0.3`. This was not flagged in the research package or the known issues table.
**Impact:** The spirit violation was more systemic than documented. All three pseudo-elements used different opacity values (0.15, 0.3, 0.3) which also violated visual consistency. All three were fixed to fully opaque with locked palette colors.
**Identity Refinement:** The "solid offset" technique (EXT-CREATIVE-001) must be FULLY opaque to comply with the soul. Any opacity < 1.0 on offset pseudo-elements creates the same visual effect as box-shadow (graduated depth illusion) and should be treated as a spirit violation.

### Discovery 2: Dark Header Convention Dramatically Changes Page Character

**Expected:** Converting the light header to dark background per OD-CONVENTION-SPEC Section 4 would be a straightforward color swap.
**Found:** The dark header fundamentally changes the page's opening statement. The white-on-dark typography creates a much stronger editorial authority -- the page ANNOUNCES itself rather than gently introducing itself. This validates EXT-CONV-011's "bold minimalism" finding: the typographic conviction IS the boldness, not decorative flamboyance.
**Identity Refinement:** The dark header is not merely a convention unification -- it is an editorial STANCE. The Unhurried Editor opens with a dark, authoritative declaration, then relaxes into the warm cream content below. This creates a CRESCENDO-inverse at the page scale: the most visually intense element is the header (dense), followed by progressively calmer content zones. This is a fractal echo of PULSE at the macro scale.

### Discovery 3: Zone Token Naming Reveals Architecture

**Expected:** Replacing `--color-question-bg` / `--color-answer-bg` / `--color-chapter-bg` with `--color-zone-sparse` / `--color-zone-dense` / `--color-zone-breathing` would be cosmetic.
**Found:** The semantic zone tokens from the convention spec are MORE powerful than the OD-001-specific names. The original names (`question-bg`, `answer-bg`) tied the tokens to this specific OD pattern. The zone names (`sparse`, `dense`, `breathing`) are UNIVERSAL -- they describe the density function, not the organizational container. This is OD-F-005 in action: the token names now say "sparse zone" not "question zone," because the question IS the sparse zone. Organization IS density, and now the tokens reflect that identity.

### Discovery 4: 5% Question Margin Creates Unexpectedly Strong TIDAL Signal

**Expected:** Adding `margin-left: 5%` to questions (EXT-CONV-010) would create subtle asymmetry.
**Found:** The 5% left margin, combined with the existing 60% max-width, creates a surprisingly strong flowing rhythm effect. Questions now feel visually "pulled in" from the left margin while answers spread to both edges. The TIDAL metaphor (water retreating then advancing) is much more perceptible than with centered-left alignment alone. This is a LOW-EFFORT, HIGH-IMPACT enhancement.

### Discovery 5: Convention Spec Type Scale Actually Preserves Existing Values

**Expected:** The convention spec would require changing --type-section from 1.625rem (26px) and --type-subsection from 1.375rem (22px) to different values.
**Found:** The convention spec's type scale (Section 5) uses the SAME values as OD-001 v2 for sections and subsections. The ONLY actual deviation was `--type-meta` (0.625rem/10px in v2 → 0.75rem/12px in convention spec). The research package's known issues table had listed "26px→24px, 22px→20px" which was INCORRECT -- the convention spec preserves 26px and 22px. The only real fix needed was --type-meta.
**Identity Refinement:** The convention spec was built FROM OD-001's type scale, not the other way around. OD-001 as the first OD SET the standard that the convention spec formalized.

## CONTEXT ACCUMULATION PROTOCOL

### Chain Traversal (3+ links)

**Link 1:** OD-outbound-findings.md -> OD-004 is the source of the GEOLOGICAL+CRESCENDO compound pattern. No OD-F findings were generated specifically BY OD-004 (all 17 OD-F came from OD-001, OD-002, OD-006). OD-004 is a CONSUMER of DD-F-004 (GEOLOGICAL), DD-F-002 (CRESCENDO), DD-F-006 (FRACTAL mandatory), and R1-001/003/004/006.

**Link 2:** OD-SYNTHESIS.md Section 4 -> OD-004 is classified as Dialect B (Functional). Characteristics: light code blocks, no scroll-witness, simpler headers, 19 thin-border CSS declarations, stratum transitions marked but spacing inconsistent. The dead zone at ~6,881px was identified in audit but later confirmed as FALSE POSITIVE (scroll-animation artifact).

**Link 3:** EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md Category 4 -> 12 EXT-CONF findings exist using DESCRIPTIVE names (not numeric IDs). All 12 APPLIED, all 12 SOUL PASS. ID format inconsistency flagged. Proposed numeric mapping in Appendix already exists but is marked "PROPOSED, not canonical."

**Link 4:** ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md Section 7 -> OD-004 needs: R1-001 (certain=sparse, uncertain=dense), R1-003 (one certainty level per viewport), R1-004 (Three-Column Doctrine), R1-006 (Horizontal Comparison Break). Density pairing: GEOLOGICAL (primary) + CRESCENDO (secondary). External research suggestions: epistemic status indicators (Gwern, LessWrong), medical grading systems, API stability markers, confidence intervals from data viz.

| EXT-CONF-001 | EXT-CONF (NNG Progressive Disclosure) | OD-004-EXTERNAL-RESEARCH.md Resource 1 | APPLIED, SOUL PASS |
| EXT-CONF-002 | EXT-CONF (Confidence Visualization) | Resource 2 | APPLIED, SOUL PASS |
| EXT-CONF-003 | EXT-CONF (Agentic Categorical Labels) | Resource 3 | APPLIED, SOUL PASS |
| EXT-CONF-004 | EXT-CONF (Gwern Kesselman Vocabulary) | Resource 4 | APPLIED, SOUL PASS |

## SOUL PASS FINDINGS

### EXT-CONF-013: Border-Weight Confidence Encoding (Stratum Visual Differentiation)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding** | Encode confidence via border-left thickness: Established=4px, Probable=3px, Speculative=2px, Open=1px. Creates a GEOLOGICAL visual gradient where structural weight correlates with certainty. |
| **Source** | Cross-synthesis: Node.js stability index (4-tier system: Deprecated/Experimental/Stable/Legacy) + uncertainty visualization research (border thickness as encoding channel) + neobrutalist design (bold borders as structural authority) |
| **Source URLs** | https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html, https://www.nngroup.com/articles/neobrutalism/ |
| **Query Context** | OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) + DD-F-004 (GEOLOGICAL layers) + DD-F-016 (inconsistent border widths) + EXT-CONF-002 (confidence visualization) |
| **Traversal** | OD-outbound -> DD-outbound -> ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY -> EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY |

**Application Guidance:** OD-004 currently uses confidence labels (Established/Probable/Speculative/Open per EXT-CONF-003) but the VISUAL encoding of confidence is primarily through typography and background color. Border-weight provides a THIRD encoding channel that is immediately perceptible at the squint-test level. This makes GEOLOGICAL layering VISIBLE even before reading text. The 4px->3px->2px->1px gradient maps directly to the geological metaphor: deeper strata have thicker, more foundational borders; surface/atmospheric strata have thinner, more tentative borders.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1: border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none -- PASS. Borders remain sharp and flat.
- Gate 2: Locked palette -- PASS. Uses only --color-primary (#E83025) for borders. Font/spacing unchanged.
- Gate 3: No 2px epidemic -- NUANCED. This intentionally uses 2px and 1px borders as MEANINGFUL confidence signals, not inconsistency. The semantic purpose differentiates this from DD-F-016's anti-pattern (random 2px borders with no semantic meaning). Rule 5 ("1px borders signal uncertainty") is actually VALIDATED by this finding -- in OD-004, 1px borders deliberately signal the lowest certainty level (Open Questions).
- Gate 4: GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO -- PASS. Border weight gradient IS the geological visual signal. Thickest at bedrock (Established), thinnest at atmosphere (Open).
- Gate 5: Identity tension -- PRODUCTIVE. The tension between Rule 5 ("commit to borders, no 1px") and semantic confidence encoding resolves productively: 1px borders are not uncertain DESIGN but uncertain CONTENT. The Unhurried Editor is confident about what is uncertain.

**Identity Tension:** PRODUCTIVE. Rule 5 says "1px borders signal uncertainty." In OD-004, they SHOULD signal uncertainty -- that IS the content's confidence level. The editor is not being timid; the editor is being honest about what is established vs speculative. This EXTENDS Rule 5 from a prohibition to a semantic tool.

---

### EXT-CONF-014: Stratum Transition Spacing System (Geological Boundary Markers)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding** | Stratum transitions need a 3-component boundary marker: 48px whitespace + visible border (3px solid --color-border) + stratum label with confidence indicator. Creates geological unconformity signals at each certainty level shift. |
| **Source** | Cross-synthesis: sticky header UX guidelines (scroll-padding for anchor navigation) + Smashing Magazine sticky menu patterns + Gestalt spacing (EXT-CONV-003) applied to geological context |
| **Source URLs** | https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/05/sticky-menus-ux-guidelines/, https://www.parallelhq.com/blog/what-sticky-header |
| **Query Context** | OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS ("stratum transitions marked but spacing inconsistent") + DD-F-004 (GEOLOGICAL layers) + EXT-CONF-010 (information scent at boundaries) + R1-003 (one certainty level per viewport) |
| **Traversal** | OD-SYNTHESIS -> OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS -> DD-outbound -> EXT-CONF-010 |

**Application Guidance:** OD-004's audit identified "stratum transitions marked but spacing inconsistent" as a key weakness. The current implementation has variable whitespace between strata with no systematic boundary treatment. This finding formalizes the transition system: each stratum boundary gets 48px vertical whitespace (matching the three-level Gestalt's chapter-level spacing from EXT-CONV-003), a visible 3px horizontal rule in --color-border (#E0D5C5), and a stratum label showing the upcoming confidence level. The label should use --font-mono (JetBrains Mono) at --type-meta size for a "classification marker" feel -- like a geologist's field notation at a stratigraphic boundary. Additionally, `scroll-padding-top` must account for the sticky geological survey header to prevent anchor targets from being hidden.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1: border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none -- PASS. Horizontal rules are flat, no shadows.
- Gate 2: Locked palette/typography -- PASS. Uses --color-border for rules, --font-mono for labels. All locked.
- Gate 3: No 2px borders -- PASS. Uses 3px horizontal rule (Cat 1 structural).
- Gate 4: GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO -- PASS. Formalizes the geological "unconformity" concept at each stratum boundary. The CRESCENDO aspect is preserved: spacing between strata can DECREASE as depth increases (tighter packing at denser confidence levels).
- Gate 5: Identity tension -- NONE. The Unhurried Editor marks section transitions clearly. This is editorial discipline.

---

### EXT-CONF-015: Dark Header as Geological Survey Map (Convention Unification)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding** | Convert OD-004's light header to dark (#1A1A1A) per OD-CONVENTION-SPEC Section 4. The dark header serves as a geological survey map -- a persistent overview showing all 4 strata, current reader position, and confidence gradient. |
| **Source** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-001.md Discovery 2 (dark header = editorial STANCE) + research-package-od-003.md EXT-TASK-016 (dark header as archipelago map) + research-package-od-005.md EXT-SPAT-017 (dark header as spatial landmark) |
| **Source URLs** | Cross-pollination (no new external URL) |
| **Query Context** | OD-CONVENTION-SPEC Section 4 + Builder Discovery 2 (OD-001) + EXT-CONF-009 (geological survey header always visible) |
| **Traversal** | research-package-od-001 -> research-package-od-003 -> research-package-od-005 -> OD-CONVENTION-SPEC |

**Application Guidance:** All three prior research packages independently converged on dark headers as a powerful convention. In OD-004's case, the dark header should contain a miniature geological column visualization showing the 4 strata as horizontal bands with decreasing border-left thickness (4px/3px/2px/1px per EXT-CONF-013), the stratum labels (Established/Probable/Speculative/Open), and a position indicator showing the reader's current stratum. This is EXT-CONF-009 (geological survey header always visible) made concrete via the convention spec's dark header pattern. The header should be sticky or partially-persistent (hide on scroll-down, reveal on scroll-up) per sticky header best practices.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1: border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none -- PASS. Dark background, no rounded corners, no shadows.
- Gate 2: Locked palette -- PASS. #1A1A1A is --color-text (locked). White text on dark bg is convention-standard.
- Gate 3: No 2px borders -- PASS. Survey map uses EXT-CONF-013 border-weight system (4/3/2/1px) intentionally.
- Gate 4: GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO -- PASS. The survey map IS the geological metaphor made visual.
- Gate 5: Identity tension -- PRODUCTIVE. Same tension as OD-001/003/005: boldness vs unhurried calm. Resolution: the dark header is typographic conviction, not flamboyance (per Builder Discovery 2).

### EXT-CONF-016: Zone Tokens for Confidence Density Semantics

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding** | Rename OD-004-specific tokens (--color-established-bg, --color-probable-bg, etc.) to dual-semantic zone tokens: --color-zone-sparse (Established), --color-zone-moderate (Probable), --color-zone-dense (Speculative), --color-zone-densest (Open). |
| **Source** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-001.md Discovery 3 (zone tokens ARE OD-F-005) + research-package-od-005.md EXT-SPAT-016 (zone tokens for spatial density) + identity-delta-wave2.md (zone tokens are now dual-semantic) |
| **Source URLs** | Cross-pollination (no new external URL) |
| **Query Context** | OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) + identity-delta-wave1 (zone token naming reveals architecture) + identity-delta-wave2 (dual-semantic naming standard) |
| **Traversal** | identity-delta-wave1 -> identity-delta-wave2 -> research-package-od-001 -> research-package-od-005 |

**Application Guidance:** Waves 1 and 2 established that zone tokens are not cosmetic renaming -- they EMBODY OD-F-005 at the CSS level. OD-004's current tokens (--color-established-bg, --color-probable-bg, --color-speculative-bg, --color-open-bg) tie the tokens to this specific OD pattern. The zone names communicate both spatial architecture AND density dimension: "zone" = spatial stratum, "sparse/moderate/dense/densest" = density level. When a stratum section uses --color-zone-dense, the CSS SAYS the speculative stratum is dense. Confidence IS density. Organization IS density. The token names now prove all three are the same.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1-3: PASS. Token renaming has zero CSS visual impact.
- Gate 4: GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO -- PASS. Zone tokens EMBODY the geological density gradient at the code level.
- Gate 5: Identity tension -- NONE. This is OD-F-005 manifest in code.

### EXT-CONF-017: Comprehensive Reduced-Motion for Scroll Animations

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding** | Apply the universal reduced-motion rule: `*, *::before, *::after { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; animation-iteration-count: 1 !important; transition-duration: 0.01ms !important; }` within `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`. Single prophylactic rule replacing per-component reduced-motion. |
| **Source** | Cross-pollination from identity-delta-wave2.md ("Comprehensive reduced-motion supersedes per-component rules. Binary rule for all future ODs.") |
| **Source URLs** | Cross-pollination (no new external URL) |
| **Query Context** | OD-004 RD-3 (scroll-driven animations Chromium-only) + identity-delta-wave2 (prophylactic reduced-motion) |
| **Traversal** | identity-delta-wave2 -> OD-004 Research Debt RD-3 |

**Application Guidance:** OD-004's inline threading header lists RD-3: "Scroll-driven animations are Chromium-only. Firefox/Safari get static fallback." Identity-delta-wave2 established the binary rule: ONE comprehensive reduced-motion block replaces all per-component rules. This is prophylactic compliance -- accessibility as default, not exception. Builder should verify OD-004 has this universal rule and add it if missing.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1-3: PASS. Accessibility mechanism, no visual soul impact.
- Gate 4: GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO -- PASS. Animations are enhancement, not structure.
- Gate 5: Identity tension -- NONE.

### EXT-CONF-018: Stratum-Internal Micro-Pacing (Fractal Compliance)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding** | Each stratum should exhibit internal micro-pacing: sparse intro (stratum orientation) / dense body (stratum content) / sparse bridge (transition to next stratum). This creates DD-F-006 fractal self-similarity at section scale within each geological layer. |
| **Source** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-002.md EXT-NARR-011 (Micro/Macro Pacing Duality) + SURPRISE-4 (micro-pacing gap explains weak fractal compliance) |
| **Source URLs** | https://fiveable.me/editorial-design/unit-1/key-elements-editorial-design/study-guide/pTBCV6S24E4M4qnn |
| **Query Context** | DD-F-006 (FRACTAL at 4 scales) + OD-SYNTHESIS Section 4 ("stratum transitions marked but spacing inconsistent") + EXT-NARR-011 (micro-pacing) |
| **Traversal** | research-package-od-002 SURPRISE-4 -> DD-F-006 -> OD-004 fractal compliance section |

**Application Guidance:** OD-002's research discovered that macro-pacing (three-act arc) was strong but micro-pacing (within-act rhythm) was weak, explaining ~33/40 score. The same diagnosis likely applies to OD-004: macro-pacing (4-stratum progression) may be adequate, but within-stratum micro-pacing may be absent. Each stratum should have: (1) sparse orientation (stratum label + confidence indicator + brief summary), (2) dense body (the actual technical content of that certainty level), (3) sparse bridge (summary of what was covered + preview of what the next stratum introduces). This creates the fractal pattern: page scale (4 strata, sparse-to-dense) mirrors section scale (within each stratum, sparse-dense-sparse) mirrors component scale (callout label sparse, callout body dense).

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1-3: PASS. Content structure, no CSS soul implications.
- Gate 4: GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO -- PASS. Micro-pacing STRENGTHENS both patterns. The geological layering becomes more visible when each stratum has internal rhythm.
- Gate 5: Identity tension -- NONE. The Unhurried Editor paces deliberately at every scale.

## SOUL FAIL FINDINGS

### SOUL-FAIL-001: Gradient Stratum Backgrounds (from uncertainty visualization research)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | Uncertainty visualization best practices -- gradient backgrounds to signal confidence transitions |
| **What it proposes** | CSS linear-gradient backgrounds transitioning between stratum colors to create smooth geological layering effect |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 1 FAIL. Gradients create depth illusion, violating Soul Piece 4 (Shadows Lie About Depth). Flat design is honest design. Gate confirmed by research-package-od-002.md SOUL-FAIL-002 (gradient backgrounds = FAIL). |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | Stratum boundaries should be SHARP, not gradual. The geological metaphor actually supports this: real geological strata have distinct boundaries (unconformities), not smooth gradients. Sharp transitions between flat background colors (#FEF9F5 -> #FFFFFF -> #FAF5ED) reinforce both the soul and the metaphor. |

### SOUL-FAIL-002: Color-Coded Confidence (Traffic-Light Pattern)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | Confidence visualization UI patterns -- green=established, yellow=probable, red=speculative |
| **What it proposes** | Assign distinct hues to confidence levels: green for established (safe), amber for probable (caution), red for speculative (warning) |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 2 FAIL. Three-color palette is LOCKED: Red + Cream + Black. Adding green and amber as semantic confidence colors contaminates the palette. Gate 3 FAIL: DD-F-015 (traffic-light colors adjacent) is an explicit anti-pattern. |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | Confidence must be encoded through TYPOGRAPHY (size, weight, style), BORDER WEIGHT (EXT-CONF-013), DENSITY (sparse vs dense), and LANGUAGE (categorical labels per EXT-CONF-003) -- never through hue. The Unhurried Editor uses language, not color coding. Callout accents (blue, green, coral, amber, purple) are the ONLY permitted colors beyond the core palette, and they signal callout TYPE, not confidence LEVEL. |

### SOUL-FAIL-003: Animated Stratum Reveal (Scrollytelling Depth)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | Scrollytelling patterns for geological/layered content |
| **What it proposes** | As user scrolls, each stratum "uncovers" the next with a reveal animation simulating geological excavation -- top layers slide away to expose deeper strata |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 1 FAIL. Sliding/reveal animations create z-depth illusion (layers appearing to exist at different depths). Soul Piece 4: everything is grounded on the same plane. Gate confirmed by research-package-od-005.md SOUL FAIL pattern (100% of fails involve MOVEMENT implying different z-depth). |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | The geological metaphor is ORGANIZATIONAL, not VISUAL. Strata are sections of a page, not literal layers that slide over each other. The reader scrolls THROUGH strata, not PAST them. If scroll-triggered reveal is used, it must be opacity 0->1 + translateY only (per EXT-CREATIVE-004 "Arriving Wisdom"), never slide/uncover. |

### SOUL-FAIL-004: Rounded Confidence Badges (Pill-Shaped Markers)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | Various confidence/status badge UI patterns |
| **What it proposes** | Pill-shaped badges (border-radius: 12px) displaying confidence level labels like "Established" / "Speculative" |
| **Gate Failure** | Gate 1 FAIL. border-radius > 0 violates Soul Piece 1 (Sharp Edges Command Authority). Gate 2 FAIL: --border-radius: 0 is LOCKED. Confirmed by research-package-od-002.md SOUL-FAIL-001 (rounded progress indicators). |
| **Exclusion Rationale** | Confidence badges must be RECTANGULAR. Sharp edges on a confidence marker communicate "this classification is precise and deliberate" -- exactly what an epistemic status marker should convey. Rounded badges would signal "this classification is approximate and friendly," undermining the editorial authority of the confidence system. |

---

## SOUL FAIL SUMMARY

| Count | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| 4 rejected | 2 depth illusions (gradients, animated reveals), 1 palette contamination (traffic-light), 1 geometry violation (rounded badges) |
| Pattern | Consistent with Waves 1-2: the soul rejects visual decoration that creates perceived depth, adds off-palette colors, or softens edges. Confidence must be encoded through typography, border weight, density, and language -- not through color hue, gradients, animation, or rounded shapes. |
| Lesson | The GEOLOGICAL metaphor is ORGANIZATIONAL (content structure), not VISUAL (page looks like rock layers). Visual encoding of confidence uses the system's existing vocabulary (border weight, typography, spacing) -- it does not import geology's visual vocabulary (gradients, textures, reveals). |

---

## SURPRISING FINDINGS

### SURPRISE 1: Rule 5 Inversion -- 1px Borders Become Semantic Tools

The most surprising finding is the inversion of Rule 5. The identity brief states "1px borders signal uncertainty." In every other OD, this is an anti-pattern to AVOID. But in OD-004, 1px borders should deliberately signal the lowest confidence level (Open Questions). The Rule 5 prohibition becomes a semantic FEATURE. This means OD-004 is the ONLY OD where thin borders are not just acceptable but REQUIRED by the content's identity. The builder should NOT apply the standard thin-border remediation to OD-004's Open Questions stratum -- those thin borders are doing exactly what Rule 5 says they do, just intentionally.

This resolves part of the "179 thin border instances" issue: some of those thin borders may be SEMANTICALLY CORRECT for the Open/Speculative strata, while others remain true anti-pattern violations. Builder must discriminate: thin borders in Established/Probable strata = anti-pattern (fix to 3px or 4px). Thin borders in Speculative/Open strata = semantic confidence signal (preserve or formalize to exactly 1px with clear intent).

### SURPRISE 2: OD-004 Answers the Forward Question -- GEOLOGICAL Layering IS Visible (Via Border Weight)

The identity-delta-wave2 forward question asked: "Does the confidence strata metaphor create visible GEOLOGICAL layering, or is it just labeled that way?"

ANSWER: With EXT-CONF-013 (border-weight confidence encoding), the GEOLOGICAL layering becomes VISIBLE at the squint-test level. Currently, OD-004's geological metaphor is primarily communicated through labels and content density. But border-weight encoding adds a STRUCTURAL visual gradient: 4px borders at the top (bedrock/Established) progressively thinning to 1px at the bottom (atmosphere/Open). This creates a visual equivalent of geological stratigraphy -- thicker, heavier, more foundational layers at the base; thinner, lighter, more tentative layers at the surface. The reader can SQUINT at the page and see the geological gradient without reading any text.

OD-003 proved compound density patterns work (ISLANDS+CRESCENDO). OD-004's GEOLOGICAL+CRESCENDO is ALSO a compound pattern, and now it has a VISIBLE compound signal: border-weight gradient (GEOLOGICAL) + typography-size reduction (CRESCENDO, per OD-F-010). Two visual gradients operating simultaneously at page scale.

### SURPRISE 3: Node.js Stability Index Validates OD-004's 4-Tier Model

Node.js documentation (v25.6.0) uses a remarkably similar 4-tier confidence system: Stability 0 (Deprecated) / 1 (Experimental, with sub-levels 1.0/1.1/1.2) / 2 (Stable) / 3 (Legacy). OD-004's Established/Probable/Speculative/Open maps directly: Established = Stable, Probable = Experimental 1.2, Speculative = Experimental 1.0, Open = not yet in API. The Node.js system has been battle-tested across thousands of API pages for 10+ years. This validates OD-004's 4-tier model as not just theoretically sound but production-proven.

The sub-level detail in Node.js (1.0 Early / 1.1 Active / 1.2 Release Candidate) suggests OD-004's Probable and Speculative strata could each have internal gradations -- but this would fight DD-F-001 (max 4 strata per EXT-CONF-001). The 4-tier model is the right granularity.

### SURPRISE 4: Dead Zone Was Already Resolved -- But Stratum Spacing Explains It

The OD-004 dead zone at ~6,881px was confirmed as a FALSE POSITIVE (scroll-animation artifact). However, the PERCEPTION of a dead zone may be explained by the "stratum transitions marked but spacing inconsistent" issue. If the Probable->Speculative transition has excessive whitespace (80px+) compared to the Established->Probable transition (32px), readers experience a perceived dead zone even though no structural gap exists. EXT-CONF-014 (stratum transition spacing system) would resolve this by formalizing consistent 48px transitions with visible boundary markers. The boundary markers fill the whitespace with PURPOSE, converting a perceived dead zone into a meaningful geological unconformity signal.

---

## FORWARD QUESTION ANSWER (from identity-delta-wave2)

**Question:** "OD-003 proved compound density patterns work (ISLANDS+CRESCENDO). OD-004's GEOLOGICAL+CRESCENDO is also a compound pattern. Does the confidence strata metaphor create visible GEOLOGICAL layering, or is it just labeled that way?"

**Answer:** With the enrichments in this research package, OD-004's GEOLOGICAL layering becomes VISIBLE through THREE channels simultaneously:

1. **Border-weight gradient** (EXT-CONF-013): 4px->3px->2px->1px left borders create a structural visual gradient visible at the squint test.
2. **Typography-size reduction** (OD-F-010, already applied): heading sizes compress as confidence decreases, creating CRESCENDO visual compression.
3. **Zone token density** (EXT-CONF-016): background color tokens shift from --color-zone-sparse (Established) to --color-zone-densest (Open), making the density gradient code-legible.

The compound pattern is: GEOLOGICAL (visible via border-weight stratigraphy) + CRESCENDO (visible via typography compression + increasing content density). Both are simultaneously active at page scale, just as OD-003's ISLANDS (discrete task clusters) + CRESCENDO (progressive complexity gradient) are simultaneously active.

**The answer to the forward question is: YES, but only after EXT-CONF-013 is applied.** Currently it is "just labeled." After enrichment, the labeling is REINFORCED by structural visual encoding.

| Discovery 3 (zone tokens ARE OD-F-005) | EXT-CONF-016 -- zone tokens for confidence density semantics. | HIGH |
| Discovery 4 (5% question margin = strong TIDAL) | Not directly applicable to confidence-based. But the principle (small CSS change, large perceptual impact) informs EXT-CONF-013 (border-weight gradient is a small CSS change with large perceptual impact). | INFORM |
| Discovery 5 (convention type scale preserves existing) | Verify OD-004 type scale matches convention spec. Note: OD-004 header lists --type-meta: 0.625rem (10px) which may diverge from convention. | VERIFY |

### From research-package-od-002.md:

| Wave 1 Finding | OD-004 Application | Priority |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| SOUL FAIL pattern (depth illusions) | Validates SOUL-FAIL-001 (gradients) and SOUL-FAIL-003 (animated reveals). | CONFIRM |
| EXT-NARR-011 (Micro/Macro Pacing Duality) | EXT-CONF-018 -- stratum-internal micro-pacing. | HIGH |
| SURPRISE-1 (Progressive Disclosure = Narrative Arc) | Extends to OD-004: Progressive Disclosure = Confidence Strata. Revealing more complex/uncertain content IS progressive disclosure. The confidence-based organization IS a form of narrative arc (from certainty to exploration). | INFORM |
| SURPRISE-3 (Missing editorial pillars) | Cross-reference: evaluate OD-004 against all four editorial pillars (Typography, Color, Layout, Imagery). OD-004 likely has Typography (strong per geological metaphor) + Color (weak per locked palette) + Layout (WEAK -- OD-SYNTHESIS calls it "simpler headers") + Imagery (survey visualization = adequate). Layout is the primary gap. | EVALUATE |

### From research-package-od-003.md:

| Wave 2 Finding | OD-004 Application | Priority |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| EXT-TASK-013 (island layout variation) | Not directly applicable to strata (strata are sequential, not parallel). But the principle of INTERNAL VARIATION applies: each stratum should have different internal layout (not all identical). | MEDIUM |
| EXT-TASK-018 (collapsible islands -> dynamic density) | Consider collapsible strata? Probably NOT -- the geological metaphor implies you dig DOWN through layers, not expand/collapse them. Collapsing a stratum would break the spatial metaphor. | REJECT |
| SURPRISE 3 (zone tokens answer forward question) | Reinforces EXT-CONF-016. | CONFIRM |
| SURPRISE 4 (OD-003 missing all four editorial pillars) | Cross-reference with OD-004 editorial pillar evaluation above. | EVALUATE |

### From research-package-od-005.md:

| Wave 2 Finding | OD-004 Application | Priority |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| EXT-SPAT-013 (flat hover feedback via border-color) | If OD-004 has any hover effects on strata or elements, they must use border-color assertion, not transform. | VERIFY |
| EXT-SPAT-015 (three-level Gestalt IS density pattern) | Directly applicable: 8px within stratum / 32px between sections within stratum / 48px between strata. This IS the geological density spacing system. | HIGH |
| SURPRISE 2 (border-color as universal flat hover) | Systemic fix. If OD-004 has territory tiles or interactive elements with transform hover, apply same fix. | VERIFY |
| SURPRISE 4 (three-level Gestalt IS WAVE in spatial form) | In OD-004 context: three-level Gestalt IS GEOLOGICAL in confidence form. Spacing hierarchy maps to confidence hierarchy. | CONFIRM |

### Re-evaluation of Prior SOUL FAIL Findings Against GEOLOGICAL+CRESCENDO:

| Prior SOUL FAIL | Re-evaluation for OD-004 |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| OD-001 SOUL-FAIL-001 (Liquid Glass / tactile shadows) | Still FAIL. No depth illusions for confidence visualization. |
| OD-001 SOUL-FAIL-002 (Overlapping/layered z-index) | Still FAIL. Geological strata must NOT literally overlap with z-index. They are sequential sections. |
| OD-001 SOUL-FAIL-003 (Golden Ratio typography) | Still FAIL. Type scale is locked. |
| OD-002 SOUL-FAIL-001 (Rounded progress indicators) | Still FAIL. Confidence markers must be rectangular. |
| OD-002 SOUL-FAIL-002 (Gradient backgrounds) | Still FAIL. Confirmed by SOUL-FAIL-001 in this package. |
| OD-002 SOUL-FAIL-003 (Animated text reveals with blur) | Still FAIL. No blur effects. |
| OD-003 SOUL-FAIL (circles, shadows, gradients, animated transitions) | All still FAIL for OD-004. |
| OD-005 SOUL-FAIL (transform-based hover creating depth) | Still FAIL. If OD-004 has hover transforms, fix per EXT-SPAT-013. |

## PRIORITY ENRICHMENT ACTIONS FOR BUILDER (Ordered by Impact)

1. **EXT-CONF-013 (Border-Weight Confidence Encoding)** -- HIGH. THE primary enrichment. Creates visible GEOLOGICAL layering via 4px/3px/2px/1px gradient. Answers the Wave 2 forward question. Transforms OD-004 from "labeled geological" to "visibly geological."
2. **EXT-CONF-015 (Dark Header as Geological Survey Map)** -- HIGH. Unifies with convention spec + creates persistent geological overview. Cross-validated by 3 prior research packages.
3. **EXT-CONF-014 (Stratum Transition Spacing System)** -- HIGH. Fixes the audit-identified "spacing inconsistent" issue. 48px whitespace + 3px rule + stratum label at each boundary.
4. **EXT-CONF-016 (Zone Tokens)** -- HIGH. Embodies OD-F-005 at CSS level. Standard dual-semantic naming.
5. **EXT-CONF-018 (Stratum-Internal Micro-Pacing)** -- MEDIUM-HIGH. Fixes fractal compliance at section scale. Each stratum gets sparse intro / dense body / sparse bridge.
6. **EXT-CONF-017 (Comprehensive Reduced-Motion)** -- MEDIUM. Binary accessibility rule. Quick to apply, resolves RD-3.
7. **Verify type scale matches convention spec** -- MEDIUM. OD-004 header shows --type-meta: 0.625rem (10px). Convention spec likely has 12px. Fix if divergent.
8. **Verify no semi-transparent offsets** -- LOW. Quick audit.
9. **Verify no transform-based hover effects** -- LOW. Apply border-color assertion if found.

## BUILDER DISCOVERIES (builder-3a)

### Discovery B3A-001: Semi-Transparent Backgrounds Were Pervasive in OD-004
**What:** OD-004 had `rgba(0,0,0,0.04)` backgrounds on callout inline code and troubleshoot inline code. These were not flagged in the research package or prior audits. Replaced with solid `var(--color-border-subtle)` backgrounds.
**Why it matters:** Identity-delta-wave1 established that ALL opacity < 1.0 creates the same visual effect as box-shadow. This is the same class of violation that builder-1a found in OD-001 (essence-pullquote::after at opacity 0.3). OD-004 had it in TWO independent locations.
**Identity impact:** Reinforces the binary rule: opacity === 1 on all visual elements. The pattern is systemic across ODs — every builder in every wave has found semi-transparent violations not caught by prior audits.

### Discovery B3A-002: The Border-Weight Gradient Creates a VISUAL Geological Column at Page Scale
**What:** After applying EXT-CONF-013, the left border of the page visually reads as: thick black line (Established) -> medium blue line (Probable) -> thin amber line (Speculative) -> hairline purple line (Open). This creates a literal geological column visible in the browser's scroll bar area, even without reading any text. The page LOOKS stratified.
**Why it matters:** This answers the Wave 2 forward question definitively. Before EXT-CONF-013, the geological metaphor was communicated only through text labels and typography compression. After EXT-CONF-013, it is STRUCTURALLY visible. A squint test at 50% zoom shows the 4-layer gradient clearly. This is the highest-impact single CSS change in the re-enrichment: ~20 CSS properties changed, but the perceptual impact is transformative.
**Identity impact:** OD-004 moves from "labeled geological" to "visibly geological." The compound pattern (GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO) is now dual-encoded: border-weight gradient (GEOLOGICAL) + typography compression (CRESCENDO). Both visible simultaneously at page scale.

### Discovery B3A-003: Content-Block Separators Were Using 2px Borders as Anti-Pattern
**What:** All four strata had `.content-block + .content-block { border-top: 2px solid var(--color-border-subtle); }` — this is the 2px border epidemic identified as systemic anti-pattern OD-F-AP-001. Changed to 1px (Cat 2 data separators). These borders separate content blocks WITHIN a stratum, making them data separators, not structural.
**Why it matters:** OD-004 had 4 instances of the 2px epidemic that were NOT the intentional EXT-CONF-013 semantic borders. The distinction matters: stratum LEFT borders (4px/3px/2px/1px) are semantic confidence signals. Content-block TOP borders are data separators (always 1px per Cat 2). Conflating these two purposes is exactly how the 2px epidemic metastasized.
**Identity impact:** Clarifies that the 3-category border system and EXT-CONF-013 can coexist precisely because they serve different purposes on different axes (left borders = confidence encoding, top borders = data separation).

### Discovery B3A-004: Zone Token Background Differentiation Is Subtle But Measurable
**What:** Applied --color-zone-sparse (#FEF9F5), --color-zone-moderate (#FFFFFF), --color-zone-dense (#FFFFFF), --color-zone-densest (#FAF5ED) as stratum backgrounds. The visual difference between #FEF9F5 and #FFFFFF is extremely subtle (warm cream vs pure white), and #FFFFFF and #FAF5ED are also close. However, combined with the border-weight gradient, the zone backgrounds create a PULSE effect: the page breathes between warm and cool as you scroll through strata.
**Why it matters:** Zone tokens alone would be cosmetic. Zone tokens PLUS border-weight gradient PLUS typography compression creates three simultaneous encoding channels. The zone backgrounds are the weakest channel individually but they create subtle PULSE rhythm that reinforces the geological layering.
**Identity impact:** Confirms identity-delta-wave1 Discovery 3: zone tokens ARE OD-F-005 in action. The CSS proves organization IS density — when you name a token --color-zone-sparse and apply it to the Established stratum, the code SAYS confident content is sparse.

### Discovery B3A-005: --type-meta Was 10px (0.625rem) — Convention Spec Requires 12px (0.75rem)
**What:** OD-004's original --type-meta was 0.625rem (10px), matching OD-003-005 (Dialect B). Convention spec Section 5 specifies 0.75rem (12px). Fixed. Additionally, many meta-level elements (exploration-meta, callout labels, evidence-dna, crux-block labels, boundary labels) were using hardcoded small pixel sizes (9px, 10px, 11px) instead of var(--type-meta). All converted to var(--type-meta).
**Why it matters:** This confirms research-package-od-001 Discovery 5 — the convention spec type scale preserves OD-001 values. The 10px was a Dialect B artifact that should have been caught in the original audit. Converting hardcoded sizes to var(--type-meta) means a single token change propagates correctly.
**Identity impact:** The type scale is now fully tokenized. No hardcoded font sizes below --type-meta remain in meta-level elements.

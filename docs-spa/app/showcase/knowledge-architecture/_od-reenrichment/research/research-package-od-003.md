# Research Package: OD-003 Task-Based Re-Enrichment

**Generated:** 2026-02-09
**Agent:** researcher-2a
**Purpose:** Bespoke external research for OD-003 re-enrichment, plus evaluation of unapplied EXT-TASK findings and cross-pollination from Wave 1
**Target:** OD-003 (Task-Based) — ISLANDS + BOOKENDS density pairing
**Quality Rank:** 6th of 6 (NEEDS MOST WORK per OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS)
**Ship Verdict:** CONDITIONAL NO

---

## CHAIN TRAVERSAL

### Path Followed:
1. `OD-outbound-findings.md` (YAML: predecessor = `stage-2-density-dd/DD-outbound-findings.md`)
2. `DD-outbound-findings.md` (YAML: predecessor = `stage-1-components/component-findings.md`)
3. `OD-SYNTHESIS.md` (Section 4: OD-003 scored ~33/40, Functional dialect B, ISLANDS+BOOKENDS)
4. `OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md` (Section 8: OD-003 ranked 6th, "NEEDS MOST WORK", 661 thin-border instances, craft=LOW)
5. `ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md` (Section 7: OD-003 specific requirements — R1-007/008/009/010/011/015, DD-F-003/006/010/014/015/016)
6. `identity-delta-wave1.md` (forward question: "How do you create VARIATION across 6 identical task islands?")
7. `research-package-od-001.md` (Wave 1 cross-pollination: zone tokens, dark header stance, opacity binary rule)
8. `research-package-od-002.md` (Wave 1 cross-pollination: Freytag falling action, micro/macro pacing, four editorial pillars)

### Emergent Insight:
The chain traversal reveals a COMPOUNDING deficit: OD-003 is ranked 6th, received the lowest craft score, AND has 4 unapplied EXT-TASK findings (5/7/8/10). It also has the most thin-border instances (661) and the longest page height (19,829px). But the deeper problem is STRUCTURAL MONOTONY — all 6 task islands follow an identical template (number + title + steps + code + checkpoint) with zero variation in complexity, layout, or visual treatment. This is the antithesis of DD-F-006 fractal self-similarity, which requires self-SIMILAR patterns, not self-IDENTICAL patterns. Similarity implies variation within coherence; identity implies no variation at all.

Cross-pollinating from Wave 1: builder-1a's discovery that zone tokens (`--color-zone-sparse`, `--color-zone-dense`) embody OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) at the token level suggests a path forward. Task islands could use zone tokens to differentiate INTERNAL structure while maintaining EXTERNAL island identity. Builder-1b's discovery that Freytag's falling action serves as a "cognitive decompression chamber" applies to OD-003's BOOKENDS pattern — the back BOOKEND could use a falling-action structure rather than abrupt termination.

## UNAPPLIED EXT-TASK FINDINGS EVALUATION

### EXT-TASK-005: Task Dependency Visualization

**Original Description:** Visual representation of task dependencies showing which tasks must complete before others can begin. Dependency arrows or connection lines between task containers.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1 (Soul Pieces): CONDITIONAL PASS — Dependency lines must be straight (not curved), sharp corners at turns. No decorative arrowheads with rounded tips.
- Gate 2 (Locked Tokens): PASS — Uses locked palette colors for lines. Line weight 3px minimum (Rule 5 context — structural lines, not accent borders).
- Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns): PASS — Does not match registry entries.
- Gate 4 (Density Pairing): SUPPORTS ISLANDS — Dependency lines CONNECT islands across the sparse sea. The visual connection emphasizes the archipelago structure — islands are related but separate. Lines in the sparse zone reinforce the density contrast.
- Gate 5 (Identity Tension): PRODUCTIVE TENSION — The Unhurried Editor is clean and minimal. Dependency lines add visual complexity. Resolution: the lines serve a STRUCTURAL purpose (showing prerequisite relationships), not a decorative one. A senior editor would include a prerequisite diagram.

**Verdict:** SOUL PASS — APPLICABLE. Should be applied to the task-map grid (the overview at the top) showing which tasks depend on which. Not to individual task islands (would clutter the dense zones). Implementation: straight 3px lines in `--color-border` (#E0D5C5) connecting task squares in the overview grid. Direction indicators via square arrowheads (Soul Piece 5).

**Priority for Builder:** MEDIUM — Strengthens the task-map overview but does not address the primary issue (structural monotony).

---

### EXT-TASK-007: Task Complexity Indicators

**Original Description:** Visual indicators showing task complexity level (beginner/intermediate/advanced) through typography weight, border thickness, or icon treatment.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1 (Soul Pieces): PASS — Complexity communicated through typography weight and border thickness aligns with soul. Size > Weight > Color hierarchy (R1-016).
- Gate 2 (Locked Tokens): PASS — Uses locked border widths (4px primary, 3px secondary). Font weights from Inter (400/500/600).
- Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns): PASS — No anti-pattern match.
- Gate 4 (Density Pairing): STRONGLY SUPPORTS ISLANDS — Complexity indicators create VARIATION between islands without breaking island structure. Each island retains its 4px left border + dense content + sparse sea isolation, but the border thickness/color and header typography weight DIFFERENTIATE one island from another. This DIRECTLY ADDRESSES the structural monotony problem.
- Gate 5 (Identity Tension): NO TENSION — A senior editor would absolutely indicate article complexity to the reader. Professional publications do this routinely.

**Verdict:** SOUL PASS — HIGH PRIORITY APPLICABLE. This finding directly solves the primary deficit: 6 identical islands become differentiated by complexity. Implementation: Task 1 = `border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-green)` (beginner, light weight header), Task 3 = `border-left: 4px solid var(--color-primary)` (intermediate, medium weight), Task 6 = `border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-purple)` (advanced, bold weight). The complexity progression creates a CRESCENDO within the ISLANDS pattern, satisfying DD-F-006 fractal at page scale.

**Priority for Builder:** HIGH — Primary solution for structural monotony.

---

### EXT-TASK-008: Task Estimated Duration

**Original Description:** Visual indication of estimated time to complete each task, helping users plan their engagement with the procedural content.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1 (Soul Pieces): PASS — Duration is informational metadata. Displayed in monospace (JetBrains Mono) as a technical specification — aligns with Soul Piece 5 (squares signal system) and the tech spec aesthetic (R1-019).
- Gate 2 (Locked Tokens): PASS — Uses JetBrains Mono + locked palette. Duration badge uses flat styling (no border-radius, no box-shadow).
- Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns): PASS — Duration is not a callout. It is metadata in the island header. Does not contribute to callout stacking.
- Gate 4 (Density Pairing): SUPPORTS ISLANDS — Duration metadata differentiates the sparse "island header" zone from the dense "island body" zone. Short tasks (2 min) have visibly different headers from long tasks (15 min), creating visual variety across islands.
- Gate 5 (Identity Tension): NO TENSION — Professional documentation (Stripe, Vercel, Linear docs) routinely shows estimated reading/completion times. Editorial magazines show article reading times. This is standard editorial metadata.

**Verdict:** SOUL PASS — APPLICABLE. Duration badges in JetBrains Mono in each island header provide visual differentiation AND user utility. Implementation: `<span class="task-duration">~5 min</span>` in monospace, `--color-text-secondary` (#666666), positioned in the island header next to the task number. Badge styling: `border: 3px solid var(--color-border)`, `padding: 4px 8px`, flat (no border-radius, no box-shadow).

**Priority for Builder:** MEDIUM — Adds visual variety to island headers and serves user needs.

---

### EXT-TASK-010: Task Bookmarking/Resume Pattern

**Original Description:** Mechanism for users to bookmark their position in a multi-task procedure and resume from where they left off. Typically via URL fragments or local storage.

**Soul Test:**
- Gate 1 (Soul Pieces): PASS — Bookmarking is a functional feature. No visual soul implications. URL fragments are invisible. Local storage is invisible.
- Gate 2 (Locked Tokens): PASS — No visual tokens required.
- Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns): PASS — No anti-pattern match.
- Gate 4 (Density Pairing): NEUTRAL — Bookmarking is a behavioral feature, not a visual one. Does not affect ISLANDS density.
- Gate 5 (Identity Tension): NO TENSION — The Unhurried Editor respects the reader's time. Bookmarking is a form of that respect.

**Verdict:** SOUL PASS — APPLICABLE but LOW PRIORITY. Implementation: Add `id` attributes to each task island header (e.g., `id="task-1-configure-pipeline"`) enabling URL fragment navigation. No visual changes needed. For enhanced version: `<a href="#task-1-configure-pipeline" class="task-anchor">` with square anchor icon (Soul Piece 5).

**Priority for Builder:** LOW — Functional improvement with zero visual impact. Should be applied but is not a quality differentiator.

### EXT-TASK Unapplied Summary

| Finding | Verdict | Priority for Builder | Addresses Primary Deficit? |
|---------|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| EXT-TASK-005 (Dependencies) | SOUL PASS | MEDIUM | No — task-map enhancement |
| EXT-TASK-007 (Complexity) | SOUL PASS | **HIGH** | **YES — differentiates 6 identical islands** |
| EXT-TASK-008 (Duration) | SOUL PASS | MEDIUM | Partially — adds header variety |
| EXT-TASK-010 (Bookmark) | SOUL PASS | LOW | No — functional only |

**All 4 unapplied findings PASS the 5-gate Soul Test. All should be applied.**

## SOUL PASS FINDINGS (for Builder)

### EXT-TASK-013: Island Layout Variation via Internal Structure Differentiation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-TASK-013 |
| **Summary** | Magazine editorial technique: recurring sections follow a familiar structural pattern, but VARY the internal layout (column count, image size, visual weight) to prevent monotony while maintaining navigability. Applied to task islands: each island retains the same external frame (4px left border, sparse sea isolation, square markers) but varies internal layout across 3-4 templates. |
| **Application Guidance** | Given DD-F-006 (FRACTAL: self-SIMILARITY, not self-IDENTITY) and DD-F-017 (anti-pattern: uniform density throughout): create 3-4 internal island templates that rotate across the 6 task islands. Template A: "Standard" — header + steps list + code block + checkpoint (used for 2 islands). Template B: "Split" — header + two-column layout (steps left, code right) for comparison tasks (used for 1-2 islands). Template C: "Dense" — header + tightly spaced steps with inline code (no separate code block) for quick tasks (used for 1 island). Template D: "Showcase" — header + large code block first + steps as annotations below for code-heavy tasks (used for 1 island). The external frame (4px border, isolation spacing, header structure) stays consistent; the internal body varies. This is self-SIMILARITY: same family, different members. |
| **Source URL** | https://fiveable.me/advanced-editorial-design/unit-6/pacing-flow-magazine-layouts/study-guide/qx1oPMn6LxMZ6RVH + https://www.publitas.com/blog/how-to-design-a-magazine-layout/ |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (no contradiction — sharp edges maintained in all templates), Gate 2 (locked tokens preserved in all templates), Gate 3 (avoids DD-F-017 uniform density), Gate 4 (STRENGTHENS ISLANDS — variation within islands creates micro-density rhythms per DD-F-006 fractal at component scale), Gate 5 (no tension — editorial variety is the identity) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | STRONGLY SUPPORTS ISLANDS + FRACTAL. Internal layout variation creates density variation WITHIN each island, satisfying DD-F-006 at component scale. The page-scale ISLANDS pattern (dense clusters in sparse sea) remains intact while each island now has its own internal density rhythm. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | None. Magazine design consistently uses section template variation. Publitas: "recurring segments benefit from layouts that follow a familiar pattern" while varying visual weight. This IS the editorial approach. |

### EXT-TASK-014: Progressive Complexity Gradient Across Task Sequence

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-TASK-014 |
| **Summary** | Wizard/stepper UX research establishes that 3-7 steps is the optimal range, with progressive complexity creating engagement: early steps are simple (low cognitive load), middle steps build complexity, and final steps represent peak difficulty. Applied to task islands: the 6 tasks should increase in complexity, step count, and visual density from Task 1 (simple, 3 steps) through Task 6 (complex, 8+ steps). This creates a CRESCENDO within the ISLANDS pattern — the page-level density is ISLANDS (discrete clusters), but the SEQUENCE of islands follows a CRESCENDO gradient. |
| **Application Guidance** | Given DD-F-003 (ISLANDS: dense clusters in sparse ocean) + DD-F-002 (CRESCENDO: sparse-to-dense progression) + OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density): implement progressive complexity across the 6 task islands: Task 1 (3 steps, green accent = beginner, single code block, 1 checkpoint). Task 2 (4 steps, green accent = beginner, 1 code block, 1 checkpoint). Task 3 (5 steps, amber accent = intermediate, 2 code blocks, 1 checkpoint + 1 troubleshoot). Task 4 (6 steps, primary red accent = intermediate, 2 code blocks + 1 config, 1 checkpoint). Task 5 (7 steps, purple accent = advanced, 3 code blocks, 2 checkpoints + 1 troubleshoot). Task 6 (8 steps, purple accent = advanced, 3+ code blocks, integration test, 2 checkpoints). The increasing density of each island creates a CRESCENDO gradient at page scale while maintaining ISLANDS isolation between them. |
| **Source URL** | https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/wizard-ui-pattern-explained + https://www.setproduct.com/blog/steps-ui-design |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (sharp edges maintained, square step markers preserved), Gate 2 (accent colors from locked palette: --accent-green, --accent-amber/--color-primary, --accent-purple), Gate 3 (avoids DD-F-017 uniform density by creating progressive gradient), Gate 4 (ISLANDS at page scale + CRESCENDO gradient across island sequence = compound density pattern), Gate 5 (no tension — progressive tutorials are natural editorial content) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | CREATES COMPOUND PATTERN: ISLANDS (page scale) + CRESCENDO (sequence scale). Each island is independently dense, but the island SEQUENCE builds from simple to complex. This is DD-F-006 fractal at PAGE scale — the same density-building pattern (CRESCENDO) appears at the page level across islands, not just within acts (OD-002) or within Q&A pairs (OD-001). |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | None. Professional documentation (Stripe, Vercel) routinely orders tutorials from simple to complex. |

### EXT-TASK-015: Dense-but-Breathable Island Spacing System

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-TASK-015 |
| **Summary** | UI density research establishes that dense interfaces can feel breathable through a systematic spacing hierarchy: tight spacing WITHIN groups, generous spacing BETWEEN groups. Applied to task islands: within each island, steps are tight (8px per R1-010), substep connectors are tighter (4px), code blocks have moderate padding (16px). Between islands, the sparse sea uses 80px+ separation (per ISLANDS isolation requirement). Between the front BOOKEND and first island, and between last island and back BOOKEND, use 64px. This three-level spacing hierarchy (4px/8px/16px within island, 64px at transitions, 80px+ between islands) creates the dense-but-breathable texture. |
| **Application Guidance** | Given R1-010 (8px within, 48px between groups) + EXT-TASK-004 (3rem after titles, 6rem between islands) + R2-2.3 (dense but breathable): formalize a 4-level spacing hierarchy for OD-003: Level 1 (micro): 4px — substep connectors, inline code padding. Level 2 (step): 8px — between steps within an island, callout internal padding. Level 3 (island): 16-24px — island header to body, code block padding, callout to next element. Level 4 (sea): 80px+ — between islands (sparse sea). Level 5 (bookend): 64px — BOOKEND to first/last island transition. This hierarchy enforces the three-level Gestalt spacing principle (EXT-CONV-003) within a task-based context. |
| **Source URL** | https://uxplaybook.org/articles/ui-fundamentals-best-practices-for-ux-designers |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (no contradiction), Gate 2 (uses --space-* tokens: --space-1:4px, --space-2:8px, --space-4:16px, --space-6:24px, --space-20:80px), Gate 3 (OPPOSES DD-F-017 uniform density by creating multi-level spacing hierarchy), Gate 4 (STRENGTHENS ISLANDS — the spacing hierarchy is the MECHANISM that creates visible island isolation), Gate 5 (no tension — professional documentation uses systematic spacing) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | FOUNDATIONAL for ISLANDS. Without a formal spacing hierarchy, island isolation is accidental. With it, the sparse sea is DESIGNED. The 80px+ gap between islands is not empty space — it is the ocean that makes the archipelago visible. |

### EXT-TASK-016: Dark Header as Island Archipelago Map

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-TASK-016 |
| **Summary** | Cross-pollinated from Wave 1 builder-1a Discovery 2 (dark header = editorial STANCE). Applied to OD-003: the dark header should serve as an ARCHIPELAGO MAP — a visual overview showing all 6 task islands, their complexity levels, dependencies, and the reader's current position. This extends the existing task-map grid concept with the dark header convention from OD-001/002 v3. The dark header establishes editorial authority ("this is a structured procedure, not a casual tutorial") and provides persistent wayfinding. |
| **Application Guidance** | Given identity-delta-wave1 (dark header = editorial STANCE) + EXT-TASK-005 (task dependency visualization) + OD-003 existing task-map grid: move the task-map grid into the dark header zone. Each task appears as a square tile (Soul Piece 5) with complexity indicator (EXT-TASK-007 color coding). Dependency lines (EXT-TASK-005, straight 3px lines) connect prerequisite tasks. Current task highlighted with --color-primary border. All tiles use border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none. Background: #1A1A1A. Text: #FAFAF5. |
| **Source URL** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-001.md Discovery 2 + research-package-od-002.md Discovery B1B-003 |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (sharp edges on all tiles, flat design), Gate 2 (locked palette: #1A1A1A bg, #FAFAF5 text, locked accents for complexity), Gate 3 (no anti-pattern), Gate 4 (STRENGTHENS ISLANDS — the map IS the ISLANDS pattern at a miniature scale, a fractal echo per DD-F-006), Gate 5 (no tension — editorial authority opening per Wave 1 discoveries) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | FRACTAL at page scale. The dark header map is a MINIATURE version of the full page's ISLANDS pattern — small dense squares (tasks) in a dark sparse field. The reader sees the archipelago twice: once as an overview (header) and once as the full content (body). This is DD-F-006 at page/section scales. |

### EXT-TASK-017: BOOKEND Back-End as Cognitive Decompression

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-TASK-017 |
| **Summary** | Cross-pollinated from Wave 1 builder-1b Discovery B1B-002 (Freytag falling action = cognitive decompression chamber). Applied to OD-003's BOOKENDS density pattern: the back BOOKEND should not be an abrupt summary but a staged decompression — verification (dense: did everything work?), then reflection (medium: what did you learn?), then next steps (sparse: where to go from here). This transforms the back BOOKEND from a flat summary into a 3-beat falling action that mirrors the front BOOKEND's 3-beat orientation (context, prerequisites, overview). |
| **Application Guidance** | Given OD-003 BOOKENDS density pairing (dense front, sparse middle, dense back) + EXT-NARR-001 (Freytag 5-beat) cross-pollinated via research-package-od-002.md: restructure the back BOOKEND as: (1) VERIFICATION island — dense, "Run these commands, you should see these outputs" (green accent). (2) REFLECTION — medium density, Essence callout (Instrument Serif italic) reflecting on what the procedure taught. (3) NEXT STEPS — sparse, clean list of forward paths. This creates a falling-action decompression: dense verification -> medium reflection -> sparse next-steps. The BOOKEND itself has internal CRESCENDO-inverse (dense-to-sparse), mirroring OD-002's Freytag structure. |
| **Source URL** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-002.md Discovery B1B-002 + EXT-NARR-001 (Freytag's Five-Act) |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (Instrument Serif italic in Essence callout = Soul Piece 2), Gate 2 (locked palette, locked fonts), Gate 3 (avoids callout stacking — max 1 Essence callout in the reflection section, per DD-F-014), Gate 4 (STRENGTHENS BOOKENDS — the back BOOKEND now has internal density variation, satisfying DD-F-006 fractal at section scale), Gate 5 (no tension — decompression after procedure completion is natural editorial practice) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | EXTENDS BOOKENDS. The back BOOKEND was previously flat (uniform dense summary). Now it has a 3-beat internal rhythm (dense verification -> medium reflection -> sparse next-steps). This is BOOKENDS + CRESCENDO-inverse, a compound density pattern that creates a satisfying cognitive conclusion. |

### EXT-TASK-018: Page Height Reduction via Collapsible Island Bodies

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-TASK-018 |
| **Summary** | Progressive disclosure research (NNGroup, IxDF) validates that collapsible sections reduce cognitive load and page height without losing content. Applied to OD-003's 19,829px problem: task islands should be collapsible via `<details>` — the island header (task number, title, complexity badge, duration badge) remains visible, while the island body (steps, code blocks, checkpoints) collapses. This transforms the page from "scroll through 6 full islands" to "see 6 island headers, expand the one you need." Initial state: Task 1 expanded, Tasks 2-6 collapsed. This preserves the ISLANDS visual pattern (6 visible headers in the sparse sea) while dramatically reducing initial page height. |
| **Application Guidance** | Given OD-003 19,829px page height (worst of all ODs) + EXT-TASK-006 (collapsible steps, already applied) + EXT-DENSITY-002 (NNGroup max 2 levels disclosure): extend collapsibility from WITHIN islands (EXT-TASK-006: completed steps collapse) to the ISLAND LEVEL. Each task island wrapped in `<details>` with `<summary>` containing the island header. Styling: `<summary>` has the full island header appearance (4px left border, complexity color, task number, title, duration). `<details>` body has the step content. This reduces the visible page to approximately: dark header (300px) + front BOOKEND (400px) + 6 island headers (6 x 120px = 720px) + 1 expanded island (~1500px) + back BOOKEND (600px) = ~3,520px. A 5.6x reduction from 19,829px. |
| **Source URL** | https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure + https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-progressive-disclosure/ |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (sharp edges on summary headers, square disclosure marker), Gate 2 (locked tokens preserved), Gate 3 (OPPOSES DD-F-017 uniform density — collapsed islands are sparse, expanded island is dense, creating dynamic ISLANDS), Gate 4 (TRANSFORMS ISLANDS — the collapsed state IS the sparse sea; each expansion creates a temporary dense island. The user controls which island is dense.), Gate 5 (PRODUCTIVE TENSION — The Unhurried Editor doesn't hide content. Resolution: the content is not hidden, it is ORGANIZED. The reader chooses which island to visit, like choosing which archipelago to explore. This IS editorial curation — the editor organizes, the reader navigates.) |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | TRANSFORMS ISLANDS from static to DYNAMIC. Instead of 6 permanently dense islands in a sparse sea, the user controls which island is currently "surfaced" (expanded = dense) while others remain as markers (collapsed = sparse). The ISLANDS pattern becomes interactive. |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | PRODUCTIVE. Unhurried = present everything confidently. Collapsible = hide things. Resolution: the editor ORGANIZES content by task, presenting an overview (all island headers visible) and letting the reader choose depth. This is editorial curation, not information hiding. The `<summary>` shows enough to make an informed choice about whether to expand. |

### EXT-TASK-019: Zone Tokens for Island Internal Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-TASK-019 |
| **Summary** | Cross-pollinated from Wave 1 builder-1a Discovery 3 (zone tokens ARE OD-F-005). Applied to OD-003: use semantic zone tokens (`--color-zone-dense`, `--color-zone-sparse`, `--color-zone-breathing`) instead of OD-003-specific container names. Within each task island, the step section uses `--color-zone-dense`, the checkpoint section uses `--color-zone-breathing`, and the surrounding sea uses `--color-zone-sparse`. This makes the density pattern VISIBLE in the CSS itself and enables each island to internally differentiate dense (steps), breathing (checkpoints), and sparse (transitions) zones. |
| **Application Guidance** | Given identity-delta-wave1 (zone tokens ARE OD-F-005) + identity-delta-wave1 forward question ("Can task islands use zone tokens to differentiate internal structure?"): YES. Replace all OD-003-specific background variables with zone tokens: `--color-zone-sparse: #FAFAF5` (sea between islands, island header background). `--color-zone-dense: #F5F0E8` (step content, code blocks). `--color-zone-breathing: #FAF8F3` (checkpoints, transitions between step groups). `--color-zone-emphasis: rgba(232,48,37,0.03)` (the currently expanded island, subtly warm). This answers the identity-delta-wave1 forward question directly and embodies OD-F-005 at the token level. |
| **Source URL** | Cross-pollination from research-package-od-001.md Discovery 3 |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS: Gate 1 (no contradiction), Gate 2 (all zone values within locked palette range — #FAFAF5, #F5F0E8, #FAF8F3 are warm cream variants), Gate 3 (no anti-pattern), Gate 4 (EMBODIES ISLANDS — the tokens DEFINE the archipelago: zone-sparse IS the sea, zone-dense IS the island), Gate 5 (no tension — semantic naming is editorial clarity) |

## UNAPPLIED R-1 EVALUATION FOR OD-003

### R1-009: Code-Adjacent Callout Positioning
**Already cited in OD-003 HTML header (line 23).** Verify application: warning callouts should appear BEFORE code blocks, tip callouts AFTER. If implemented, mark as APPLIED. If not, flag for builder.
**Verdict:** VERIFY — may already be applied.

### R1-011: Default Story Pattern
**Already cited in OD-003 requirements (ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY Section 7).** Each task should start with minimal required state. Verify: does each island begin with a "Prerequisites" or "You need" section showing minimal starting state?
**Verdict:** VERIFY — should already be applied per spec.

### R1-015: Recipe Pattern
**Already cited in OD-003 requirements.** Tasks show components in combination. Verify: does the final task island (Task 6) demonstrate how prior tasks combine into a complete workflow?
**Verdict:** VERIFY — the progressive complexity gradient (EXT-TASK-014) addresses this by making Task 6 the integration task.

### R1-010: Grouping Proximity
**Already applied per OD-003 HTML header (line 22).** Steps tight (8px), tasks separated (48px). Verify spacing values match formal spec.
**Verdict:** VERIFY spacing values.

## SOUL FAIL FINDINGS (documentation only, DO NOT APPLY)

### SOUL FAIL 1: Rounded Progress Steppers

**Source:** Multiple stepper UI design resources (Material UI, MUI, PatternFly)
**What it proposes:** Circular step indicators, pill-shaped progress bars, rounded connector endpoints.
**Gate Failure:** Gate 1 FAIL (border-radius > 0 violates Soul Piece 1), Gate 2 FAIL (requires border-radius > 0 for circles/pills)
**Exclusion Rationale:** OD-003 already uses SQUARE step markers (EXT-TASK-002, Soul Piece 5). All stepper research that uses circles must be adapted to squares. The setproduct.com guide recommends "corner radius: consistency across all states, typically circles or soft rectangles" — we use SHARP rectangles, no exceptions.

### SOUL FAIL 2: Card Shadows for Depth Hierarchy

**Source:** Card UI design resources (bricxlabs.com "10 Card UI Design Examples")
**What it proposes:** Subtle elevation shadows on cards to create hierarchy, hover lift effects.
**Gate Failure:** Gate 1 FAIL (box-shadow violates Soul Piece 4), Gate 2 FAIL (requires box-shadow), Gate 3 FAIL (matches anti-pattern: Hover Lift Effects, per EXT-CREATIVE-001 spirit violation assessment)
**Exclusion Rationale:** Task island hierarchy is achieved through BORDER THICKNESS + COLOR + TYPOGRAPHY WEIGHT (per EXT-TASK-007), not through shadows. The solid offset technique (EXT-CREATIVE-001) is the only permitted depth substitute, and only when fully opaque (opacity = 1.0, per identity-delta-wave1 binary rule).

### SOUL FAIL 3: Gradient Connectors Between Steps

**Source:** Stepper design resources (designmodo.com "Progress Step UI Design Patterns")
**What it proposes:** Gradient-filled connector lines between steps, color transitioning from completed to upcoming.
**Gate Failure:** Gate 1 FAIL (gradients create depth illusion, Soul Piece 4). Gate 2 FAIL (gradients are off-palette — locked palette has no gradient definitions).
**Exclusion Rationale:** Step connectors use SOLID lines in a single color (completed: `--color-primary` #E83025; upcoming: `--color-border` #E0D5C5). The binary state (complete/incomplete) is signaled by color swap, not gradient.

### SOUL FAIL 4: Animated Step Transitions

**Source:** Multiple wizard/stepper resources recommending slide-in/fade animations between steps.
**Gate Failure:** Gate 1 CONDITIONAL FAIL — animation itself is not a soul violation (EXT-CREATIVE-004 "Arriving Wisdom" uses opacity + translateY). But animated TRANSITIONS between steps (slide-left, card-flip) create transient depth and movement illusion.
**Exclusion Rationale:** Task island expansion/collapse should use CSS-only `<details>` native behavior (instant toggle). If animation is desired, use ONLY opacity 0->1 + translateY(16px)->0 (per EXT-CREATIVE-004), respecting prefers-reduced-motion.

---

## SOUL FAIL SUMMARY

| Count | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| 4 rejected | All failed on Soul Piece violations: border-radius (circles/pills), box-shadow (card depth), gradients (connector fill), animated depth transitions |
| Pattern | 100% of SOUL FAIL findings involve DECORATIVE DEPTH — techniques that create visual depth hierarchy through shadows, gradients, rounded shapes, or animated spatial movement |
| Lesson | Task differentiation must be achieved through TYPOGRAPHY, COLOR, BORDER WEIGHT, and SPACING — the editorial toolkit. Never through depth, shadow, rounding, or gradient. |

## SURPRISING FINDINGS

### SURPRISE 1: ISLANDS + CRESCENDO = Compound Density Pattern

EXT-TASK-014 reveals that progressive complexity across 6 task islands creates a CRESCENDO gradient at page scale while maintaining ISLANDS isolation. This is a COMPOUND density pattern — two DD patterns operating simultaneously at different scales. ISLANDS governs the spatial relationship (dense clusters in sparse sea). CRESCENDO governs the sequential relationship (simple-to-complex progression). This was partially anticipated in ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md Section 7 ("BOOKENDS as secondary for Context-Action-Summary structures") but the CRESCENDO gradient across islands is a THIRD density pattern operating at page scale. OD-003 may be the first exploration to demonstrate THREE simultaneous density patterns: ISLANDS (spatial), BOOKENDS (structural), and CRESCENDO (sequential).

### SURPRISE 2: Collapsible Islands Transform ISLANDS from Static to Dynamic

EXT-TASK-018 transforms the ISLANDS density pattern from a static arrangement (6 fixed dense clusters) to a DYNAMIC one (user controls which island is "surfaced"). This is unprecedented — no other OD has a user-controlled density pattern. In OD-001, the Q&A PULSE is fixed. In OD-002, the narrative CRESCENDO is fixed. But in OD-003, the reader CHOOSES which island to expand, controlling the page's density distribution. This elevates ISLANDS from a spatial metaphor to an interactive navigation paradigm.

### SURPRISE 3: Zone Tokens Answer the Identity Delta Forward Question Definitively

The identity-delta-wave1 forward question asked: "Can task islands use zone tokens to differentiate internal structure while maintaining external island identity?" EXT-TASK-019 answers YES — and reveals that zone tokens don't just differentiate internal structure, they EMBODY OD-F-005 at the CSS level. The token name `--color-zone-dense` IS the density, not a description of it. When a task island's step section uses `--color-zone-dense`, the CSS SAYS the steps are dense. This is Organization IS Density manifest in code.

### SURPRISE 4: OD-003 Missing ALL Four Editorial Pillars

Cross-pollinating from research-package-od-002.md's EXT-NARR-008 (Four Pillars of Editorial Cohesion): OD-003 has WEAK scores in ALL four pillars — Typography (repetitive, no hierarchy across islands), Color (off-palette #B8A080 was removed, leaving monotone), Layout (identical template for all 6 islands), Imagery (no diagrams, no architecture visualization, task-map grid is the only visual element). OD-001 had strong Typography+Color with weak Layout+Imagery. OD-002 had strong Typography+Color with weak Layout+Imagery. OD-003 has ALL FOUR weak. This explains the rank-6 position.

## BUILDER DISCOVERIES (appended by builder-2a | 2026-02-09)

### Discovery B2A-001: Collapsible Islands Transform the ISLANDS Pattern into a Navigation Paradigm

The `<details>` wrapping per EXT-TASK-018 does more than reduce page height. It transforms the ISLANDS pattern from a static spatial arrangement into an **interactive wayfinding system**. In collapsed state, the 6 island headers form a visual table of contents — the reader sees the entire archipelago at a glance. Each expansion is a deliberate choice to "visit" that island. This is fundamentally different from OD-001 (linear scrolling through Q&A) or OD-002 (narrative arc demanding sequential reading). OD-003 becomes the first OD where the reader controls the density distribution of the page.

### Discovery B2A-002: The Three-Category Border System Handles 471 Thin Borders Cleanly

The identity-delta-wave1 question was: "Can the 3-category border system handle OD-003's 471 thin borders without destroying the island visual structure?" Answer: YES. The overwhelming majority of OD-003's 2px borders were micro-element borders (Cat 3: step markers, task-map squares, verification checks) that convert cleanly to 1px. Structural borders (Cat 1: task island frames, callout left-borders, code block frames) stay at 3-4px. The 2px-to-1px conversion actually IMPROVES island visual structure by creating stronger contrast between the heavy structural borders (3px+) that define island edges and the light micro borders (1px) inside islands.

### Discovery B2A-003: Progressive Complexity Creates a COMPOUND Density Pattern

Applying EXT-TASK-007 and EXT-TASK-014 together creates the compound ISLANDS + CRESCENDO pattern that researcher-2a predicted (Surprise Finding 1). The beginner islands (green, simpler) are genuinely less dense than the advanced islands (purple, more steps + more code blocks + more callouts). This means the CRESCENDO is not just visual (color gradient) but structural (actual density increase). The island SEQUENCE is a CRESCENDO while the island ARRANGEMENT is ISLANDS. Two density patterns operating simultaneously at different scales.

### Discovery B2A-004: Dark Header Map Is a Genuine Fractal Echo

The archipelago map (EXT-TASK-016) in the dark header creates a miniature version of the full page. 6 small squares (tiles) in a dark sparse field = the page structure compressed. Each tile has the same complexity color coding as its full island. This is DD-F-006 fractal at a MINIATURE scale — the reader encounters the same pattern twice at different sizes.

### Discovery B2A-005: Zone Tokens Reveal the Sparse Sea Mechanically

Replacing hard-coded `background: white` and `background: var(--color-border-subtle)` with `var(--color-zone-dense)` and `var(--color-zone-sparse)` makes the ISLANDS pattern visible in the CSS source code itself. The ocean (page background = --color-zone-sparse) and the islands (task containers = --color-zone-dense) are now named for what they ARE, not what container they're in. This is OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) manifest at the token level, confirming researcher-2a's Surprise Finding 3.

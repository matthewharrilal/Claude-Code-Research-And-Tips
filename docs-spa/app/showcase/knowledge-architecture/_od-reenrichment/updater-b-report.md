**Action:** Created v1.1 from v1, synthesizing all 3 identity delta documents.
**Key additions:**
- ANTI-PHYSICAL identity section (20/20 SOUL FAILs, 6 categories)
- Binary rules for opacity (=== 1.0) and animated offsets (move? FAIL)

- ISLANDS dual mode (static + interactive)
- GEOLOGICAL = BORDER WEIGHT (flat 2D encoding)
- 3-category border system with orthogonal encoding
- Zone token naming with dual semantics
- Dark header as universal amplifier
- Compound density patterns (2+ simultaneous)
- All 3 waves' surprises, refinements, and forward questions preserved
- v3 scores for all 6 ODs in all tables
- Open Questions for AD section (6 questions from all 3 wave deltas)
- Updated identity statement reflecting ANTI-PHYSICAL, 5th fractal scale, and org=density token proof

### 2. PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md

### 5. RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md
**Path:** `DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md`
**Edits:**
- Updated "Last Updated By" to Wave 4 updater-b
- Added final reconciliation update log entry with:

## Notes for Next Agents

- ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.1.md is the authoritative identity document for AD. AD should consume it and produce v2.
- The v1 file (ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.md) remains as historical record but is superseded by v1.1.
- Semi-transparent background audit (rgba sweep) is flagged as an AD requirement in both SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md and ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.1 Section 7.
- R-2 Creative Layouts (27 findings at 0% consumption) is flagged as AD evaluation target.

OD-005 Spatial (35/40, v3)
  ├── Density: WAVE (DD-F-005 TIDAL variant) + ISLANDS (DD-F-003)
  ├── DD-F-006 FRACTAL: mandatory at 5 scales
  ├── OD-005 v3: Hub-spoke IS WAVE — dark header creates 3-phase density cascade
  ├── OD-005 v3: Territory tiles as ISLANDS with flat hover feedback
  ├── OD-005 v3: CSS Grid named areas for spatial semantics
  ├── OD-005 v3: Breadcrumbs as WAVE trigger (spoke → hub orientation)

AD-005 Axis Choreography
  ├── Choreographed axis transitions: vertical → horizontal → vertical
  ├── Cinematic flow: establishing → medium → close-up → wide
  ├── Diagonal accents as section dividers (clip-path, not rotation)
  ├── Pairs with WAVE: hub-spoke transitions create density cascade
  └── DD-F-012: density implies axis — WAVE implies choreographed movement
```

**Transitive Chain:** Spatial (OD-F-005) → WAVE+ISLANDS (DD-F-005, DD-F-003) → Axis Choreography with cinematic flow and diagonal accents (DD-F-012, OD-F-FL-001)

**Why Choreography for Spatial:** Spatial organization demands intentional axis management — the reader navigates through hub-spoke territory, transitioning between 2D spatial zones. Choreography formalizes these transitions: when a reader moves from hub overview to spoke detail, the axis shifts from horizontal scanning (grid overview) to vertical reading (spoke content). This shift IS the WAVE — the density oscillates as the reader moves between sparse hub (overview) and dense spoke (detail). The cinematic analogy (establishing → close-up → wide) provides the pacing model for these transitions. Diagonal accents via clip-path mark axis direction changes, creating visual momentum without violating the ANTI-PHYSICAL identity.

## 2. R-4 FINDINGS (SOUL PASS + CONDITIONAL PASS)

### SOUL PASS Findings (18)

| # | Finding ID | Description | How AD-005 Should Apply |

| 2 | R4-038 | Alternating rhythm: set pattern repeats with variation (ABAB) | Hub-spoke WAVE alternation: sparse hub overview ↔ dense spoke content ↔ sparse hub return. |
| 3 | R4-043 | Musical analogy: verse=regular content, chorus=hero, bridge=transition | Hub = verse (regular grid), Spoke = chorus (hero content), Transition = bridge (axis change). |
| 4 | R4-050 | Cinematic establishing shot = context/overview | Hub page IS the establishing shot. Wide view of all territory tiles. Orients before diving. |
| 5 | R4-051 | Cinematic close-up = detail focus, creates intimacy | Spoke page IS the close-up. Dense, focused content on single topic. Typographic zoom (not CSS zoom). |
| 6 | R4-052 | Shot progression: wide (context) → close (detail) → wide (synthesis) | Hub (wide) → Spoke (close) → Hub return (wide synthesis). Natural WAVE density oscillation. |
| 7 | R4-053 | Montage (quick cuts) creates energy — use for feature lists | Hub tile grid IS a montage — multiple territory previews in quick visual succession. |
| 8 | R4-054 | Slow panning creates contemplation — use for concept explanations | Spoke deep-dive content uses generous whitespace and long-form text. IS-7 (Unhurried Editor). |
| 9 | R4-055 | Establishing shots orient before diving into details | Dark header (EXT-SPAT-017) as establishing shot showing territory map before hub content. |

| 13 | R4-064 | Hub-and-spoke: central hub enables exploration of spokes | Hub tile grid enables navigation to spoke pages. Hub IS the spatial navigation center. |
| 14 | R4-036 | Five types of visual rhythm: regular, alternating, progressive, flowing, random | Choreography uses ALTERNATING (hub↔spoke) with FLOWING transitions between them. |
| 15 | R4-042 | Breaking established rhythm creates focal points | Axis transition from vertical to horizontal is a deliberate rhythm break. Diagonal accent marks it. |
| 16 | R4-044 | Musical rest = whitespace/breathing room | Transition zones between hub and spoke are musical rests. 48px+ breathing (OD-F-007). |
| 17 | R4-090 | Verse-chorus-bridge maps to regular-hero-transition sections | Hub grid (verse) → Spoke hero (chorus) → Transition back (bridge). Repeating navigation cycle. |
| 18 | R4-098 | Pattern decision matrix with complexity ratings | Choreography is HIGH complexity. Budget extra iteration time. |

**Total R-4 Findings for AD-005: 49** (exceeds minimum of 20)

## 3. R-2 FINDINGS (EMBEDDED)

### R2-1.1: Breaking the Grid (Intentional Mess)

**AD-005 Application:** Choreographed spoke elements that extend beyond grid cells to create movement hierarchy. Within the hub grid, one territory tile spans 2 columns (breaking the regular grid pattern) to signal a featured territory. The grid break IS the choreographic accent — it directs the eye to the next axis direction change. In spoke pages, content elements that break the max-width container signal transitions between content types (code → explanation → diagram).

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-1.1 + R4-042 (rhythm break) = intentional grid breaks as choreographic cues.

---

### R2-1.3: Multi-Column Text with Visual Interruptions

**AD-005 Application:** Hub pages with multi-column spoke summaries. Each territory tile contains a 2-column internal layout: left column = territory name and description, right column = key metrics or preview. Spoke pages use multi-column for reference-heavy sections (code on left, explanation on right). Visual interruptions = diagonal clip-path accents between multi-column sections.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-1.3 + R4-056/057 (bidirectional scroll) = multi-column spoke layouts with contained horizontal scroll.

---

### R2-1.4: Running Headers and Section Markers (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-005 Application:** Running headers become choreography beat indicators. "Hub > Territory: Architecture > Section: Patterns" persists as the reader navigates through spoke content. The breadcrumb trail (EXT-SPAT-002) is the primary running header, showing hub → spoke → section path at all times. This anchors spatial orientation during axis transitions.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-1.4 + R4-091 (establishing shot) = persistent spatial wayfinding during choreography.

---

### R2-1.5: White Space as Content (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-005 Application:** Whitespace encodes axis transitions. Between hub tiles: 24px grid gap (regular ISLANDS spacing). Between hub and spoke content: 48px+ mode-transition breathing (OD-F-007). Between spoke sections: 32px section gap. The WAVE density oscillation is visible through whitespace variation: sparse hub → dense spoke → sparse transition → dense spoke.

---

### R2-2.2: Card-Based Composition with Hierarchy Signals

**AD-005 Application:** Choreographed spoke tiles as hierarchy-signaled cards. Territory tiles in hub grid use size hierarchy (2x1 featured, 1x1 standard) with flat cards (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none). Hierarchy signals through border-left width (4px for primary territories, 1px for secondary) and typography scale (larger title for featured territories). Flat hover feedback via border-color assertion (EXT-SPAT-013).

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-2.2 + R4-064 (hub-and-spoke) = hierarchy-signaled territory navigation cards.

---

### R2-2.3: Dense but Breathable Interfaces

**AD-005 Application:** Choreographed hub dense (tile overview, compact), spokes breathable at rest (generously spaced content), dense when expanded (code blocks, reference tables). The WAVE oscillates between these states. The hub is the "inhale" (compact information gathering), the spoke is the "exhale" (expansive content consumption), and the transition is the "breath" (axis change recovery).

---

### R2-4.1: Bento Grid Layout

**AD-005 Application:** Choreographed hub page uses bento-like tile arrangement for spoke navigation. 4-column grid with varied tile sizes: featured territory at 2x1, standard territories at 1x1. The bento layout IS the hub's spatial map — tile position encodes territory relationships. Grid gaps = ISLANDS ocean between territory tiles.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-4.1 + R4-064 (hub-and-spoke) = bento-grid hub with spoke navigation.

---

### R2-4.2: Asymmetric / Broken Grid Layouts

**AD-005 Application:** Choreographed spoke tiles with asymmetric sizing creates visual hierarchy without decoration. Featured territory tile at 2x1 breaks the regular 1x1 grid, creating asymmetry that signals "start here." The asymmetry IS the choreographic direction — the larger tile is the first beat.

---

### R2-4.3: CSS Grid with Fractional Units (fr)

**AD-005 Application:** Hub-spoke grid with flexible fr-based proportions. Hub grid: `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)` for equal territory tiles. Spoke layout: `grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr` for content + sidebar (magazine grid per EXT-SPAT-003). Fr units enable responsive axis choreography — proportions hold across viewports.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-4.3 + R4-057 (bidirectional scroll) = fr-based responsive hub-spoke layout.

---

### R2-4.4: Golden Ratio Grid System (PARTIAL PASS)

**AD-005 Application:** Hub at 61.8% viewport, spoke navigation sidebar at 38.2% creates natural balance. LAYOUT ONLY — typography values MUST use locked type scale (NOT golden ratio 1.618x scale). The golden ratio proportion creates a visually comfortable split between spatial overview (hub) and navigation tools (sidebar).

---

### R2-4.5: Swiss Design Grid System

**AD-005 Application:** Choreographed spoke page layouts use Swiss grid principles for clean, navigable structure. Consistent gutters (24px) across spoke pages create professional, editorial spacing. The Swiss tradition of "classic sophistication with modern flexibility" aligns with IS-7 (Unhurried Editor). Swiss grid discipline prevents choreographic chaos — the grid is the stable foundation that axis transitions play against.

---

### R2-6.1: Split Screen Layouts

**AD-005 Application:** Hub on one side, active spoke content on the other creates choreographed split-screen navigation. At desktop (1440px+), persistent hub sidebar (38.2% width) with spoke content (61.8% width). The split IS the spatial navigation — readers see both map (hub) and territory (spoke) simultaneously. On mobile, hub collapses to breadcrumb navigation.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-6.1 + R4-064 (hub-and-spoke) = split-screen spatial navigation.

---

### R2-6.3: Scrollytelling for Documentation

**AD-005 Application:** Choreographed scroll-driven transitions between hub and spoke views. As reader scrolls past hub tiles, the view transitions to spoke content (axis change from horizontal grid to vertical reading). Fixed wayfinding indicator (EXT-SPAT-018) updates to show current territory and density zone. Must respect prefers-reduced-motion — static fallback shows hub and spokes as stacked sections.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-6.3 + R4-116 (scroll-based disclosure) = scroll-driven hub-spoke choreography.

---

### R2-6.5: Copy-Paste Component Philosophy (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-005 Application:** Choreography axis layout CSS extractable and reusable. Hub-spoke grid, diagonal clip-path accents, transition zone spacing, territory tile components — all as copy-paste CSS patterns. The axis choreography system should be independently usable for any hub-spoke documentation layout.

**Total R-2 Findings for AD-005: 14** (exceeds minimum of 8)

## 4. UNAPPLIED OD-F / DD-F FINDINGS CARRIED FORWARD

### From OD Stage

| Finding | What It Says | How AD-005 Should Apply |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| OD-F-005 | Organization IS Density | Spatial mapping IS WAVE density. Hub-spoke navigation creates sparse-dense oscillation. |
| OD-F-007 | Mode-transition breathing (48px+) | Between hub and spoke content, 48px+ breathing zones. Axis change = mode transition. |
| OD-F-004 | Chapter dividers as breathing zones | Within spoke pages, chapter dividers between dense sections provide recovery whitespace. |
| OD-F-AP-001 | 2px border epidemic — use 3-category system | Hub tile borders Cat 1 (3px+ structural). Internal spoke separators Cat 2 (1px). Zero 2px. |

### From DD Stage

| Finding | What It Says | How AD-005 Should Apply |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| DD-F-003 | ISLANDS: dense clusters in sparse space | Territory tiles = dense clusters. Hub grid gaps = sparse space. Spoke content = dense island. |
| DD-F-005 | TIDAL: width as inverse density | Hub tiles at fixed width. Spoke content at max-width: 860px. Width variation creates TIDAL rhythm between hub (full-width grid) and spoke (constrained content). |
| DD-F-006 | FRACTAL: self-similarity at 5 scales | Choreography fractal: page scale (hub-spoke), section scale (within-spoke sections), component scale (territory tiles), character scale (typographic rhythm), navigation scale (breadcrumb path). |
| DD-F-014 | Max 2 callouts per viewport | Within spoke content, max 2 callouts visible. Dense spokes especially prone to stacking. |
| DD-F-015 | No traffic-light color adjacency | Territory tiles never use red/green adjacent accents. |
| DD-F-016 | Consistent border widths — 3-category system | Hub tile borders 3px+ (structural), spoke internal separators 1px (data). No 2px. |

## 5. EXT-AXIS-CH FINDINGS (Bespoke External Research)

### EXT-AXIS-CH-001: Cinematic Shot Progression as Axis Choreography Model

**Description:** The cinematic language of shot progression (establishing → medium → close-up → wide) provides the structural model for axis choreography. The "establishing shot" (hub overview) is horizontal scanning — the reader surveys all territories. The "medium shot" (spoke intro) shifts to vertical reading — the reader begins descending into a territory. The "close-up" (spoke detail) is deep vertical reading — dense code blocks and reference tables. The "wide shot" (spoke summary) returns to horizontal awareness — synthesis and return-to-hub prompt. Each shot transition is an AXIS CHANGE choreographed through spacing, typography scale, and content density.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Cinematic language is a structural metaphor. The CSS implementation is flat: spacing changes, typography scale changes, background zone changes. No animation, no parallax, no z-depth. The "shots" are content structure, not visual effects.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Hub establishing shot: `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);` — horizontal scanning
2. Spoke close-up: `max-width: 860px; margin: 0 auto;` — constrained vertical reading
3. Shot transition: 48px+ whitespace + background zone change + diagonal clip-path accent

---

### EXT-AXIS-CH-002: Diagonal Clip-Path as Axis Direction Signal

**Description:** Diagonal section dividers created via `clip-path: polygon()` serve as visual signals that the axis direction is changing. When the reader transitions from horizontal hub scanning to vertical spoke reading, a diagonal clip-path section marks the transition. The diagonal is a 2D graphic element — like a diagonal rule in a printed magazine — that creates visual momentum without animation or 3D effects. The angle encodes direction: top-left to bottom-right = "descending into detail", bottom-left to top-right = "ascending to overview."

**Soul Test:** PASS — clip-path is flat 2D CSS masking. The diagonal edge is a straight line (not curved). No border-radius, no box-shadow. Solid colors from locked palette. The diagonal is a graphic design element, consistent with editorial/magazine layout tradition.

**Signature Elements:**
1. `.axis-transition { clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 85%, 0 100%); }` — descending diagonal
2. Background: solid color from locked palette (--color-background or zone token)
3. Max 2-3 diagonal accents per page (R4-134: use sparingly)

---

### EXT-AXIS-CH-003: WAVE Density Oscillation via Hub-Spoke Navigation

**Description:** The hub-spoke navigation pattern creates a natural WAVE density oscillation. Hub = sparse (overview tiles, generous whitespace, horizontal scanning). Spoke = dense (detailed content, code blocks, vertical reading). Return-to-hub = sparse (breadcrumb navigation, hub overview). This oscillation IS the WAVE pattern — each hub-spoke-hub cycle is one complete wave. The choreography's job is to make the WAVE transition smooth through axis direction management, breathing zones, and consistent wayfinding.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Navigation pattern is content architecture. The WAVE oscillation is created through content density variation, not visual effects. Flat CSS throughout.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Hub density: sparse — `gap: 24px;` grid, minimal text per tile, generous margins
2. Spoke density: dense — `line-height: 1.6;` body text, code blocks, reference tables
3. Transition density: breathing — `padding: 48px 0;` between hub and spoke sections

---

### EXT-AXIS-CH-004: Flat Progress Indicator for Axis Position

**Description:** A flat, rectangular progress indicator showing the reader's position within the axis choreography. The indicator is a CSS-only element: a horizontal bar with rectangular segments representing hub (wide segment), transition (narrow segment), and spoke sections (variable segments). The active segment is highlighted with --color-primary. Square segment markers (Soul Piece 5). No rounded progress bar ends, no shadow, no gradient fill. This makes the choreography's structure VISIBLE to the reader.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Flat rectangular bar. border-radius: 0. box-shadow: none. Solid colors from locked palette. Square markers. The indicator is a flat 2D diagram, not a 3D progress element.

**Signature Elements:**
1. `.progress-segment { border-radius: 0; background: var(--color-border-subtle); }` — flat segments
2. `.progress-segment--active { background: var(--color-primary); }` — active highlight
3. Segments proportioned to content length: hub segment at 20%, spoke segments at 80%/n

---

### EXT-AXIS-CH-005: Responsive Axis Collapse Strategy

**Description:** At desktop (1440px+), choreography operates as designed: horizontal hub grid → diagonal transition → vertical spoke content → return-to-hub. At tablet (768px-1440px), the 4-column hub grid collapses to 2-column, and the split-screen (hub sidebar + spoke content) collapses to full-width spoke with breadcrumb navigation. At mobile (<768px), all choreography becomes vertical: hub tiles stack vertically, diagonal accents simplify to horizontal borders, spokes fill full viewport width. The WAVE oscillation is preserved at all breakpoints through density variation (spacing changes), even when the axis direction choreography simplifies.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Responsive design via CSS media queries and grid auto-flow. No soul implications. The axis simplification at smaller viewports is functional, not decorative.

**Signature Elements:**
1. `@media (max-width: 1440px) { .hub-grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); } }` — 2-column
2. `@media (max-width: 768px) { .axis-transition { clip-path: none; border-top: 3px solid; } }` — simplified
3. WAVE density preserved via spacing tokens regardless of axis direction changes

## 6. SIGNATURE ELEMENTS SUMMARY

| Finding | Signature Element 1 | Signature Element 2 | Signature Element 3 |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| EXT-AXIS-CH-001 | Hub: 4-column grid | Spoke: 860px constrained | 48px+ shot transitions |
| EXT-AXIS-CH-002 | clip-path: polygon() diagonal | Solid locked palette color | Max 2-3 per page |
| EXT-AXIS-CH-003 | Sparse hub (24px gap) | Dense spoke (code + text) | 48px breathing transition |
| EXT-AXIS-CH-004 | Flat rectangular progress bar | --color-primary active segment | Square segment markers |
| EXT-AXIS-CH-005 | 4→2→1 column collapse | Diagonal → border simplification | WAVE preserved via spacing |

## 7. SOUL FAIL FINDINGS (Reference Only — NOT for Application)

| Finding ID | Description | Why It Fails | Gate Violated |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| R4-152 | Diagonal: header "moves away from viewer, creating depth" | CSS perspective or translateZ = ANTI-PHYSICAL | G5, G6 |
| R4-153 | Cinematic: "close-ups create connection/intimacy" via visual zoom | CSS transform: scale() animation = ANTI-PHYSICAL | G5 |
| R4-156 | Cinematic: shot progression creates emotional journey | UI effects designed to create feelings = contradicts editorial calm | IS-7 |
| R4-157 | Visual rhythm: "flowing rhythm" like sand dunes | Rounded containers or organic shapes = G1/G8 violation | G1, G8 |
| R4-159 | Diagonal: "sense of action and excitement" | Animation or dynamic effects = contradicts editorial calm | IS-7 |
| R4-160 | Cinematic: montage quick cuts "create energy" | Rapid animation transitions = ANTI-PHYSICAL | G5 |
| R4-182 | Diagonal: header with parallax scroll depth effect | Parallax = canonical ANTI-PHYSICAL violation | G6 |
| R4-191 | Diagonal: gradient color transitions along diagonal | Gradient = light interaction = material simulation | G7 |

**AD-005 Specific Risk:** Choreography is the AD with the MOST CONDITIONAL PASS findings (20) because movement-based concepts (cinematic flow, diagonal accents, axis transitions) constantly brush against the ANTI-PHYSICAL identity. The key distinction: structural choreography (spacing changes, typography shifts, clip-path accents) = PASS. Visual choreography (animations, parallax, scroll-jacking, perspective transforms) = FAIL. Every "movement" in AD-005's choreography must be metaphorical (content structure) rather than literal (CSS animation). The reduced-motion prophylactic is MANDATORY for any scroll-driven behavior.

## 8. RESEARCH DISCOVERIES / OPEN QUESTIONS FOR IDENTITY DELTA

### Discoveries to Investigate

1. **Diagonal clip-path as KortAI signature:** Could diagonal section dividers (clip-path: polygon()) become a recognized KortAI axis element — a visual signature that differentiates KortAI choreography from generic hub-spoke navigation? The diagonal IS editorial (magazine layouts use angled columns), which aligns with IS-7.

2. **Choreography complexity budget:** AD-005 has 49 R-4 findings (most of any AD) and 20 CONDITIONAL PASS (most of any AD). Does this high conditional count indicate that choreography is inherently risky for this soul, or that choreography offers the most adaptation opportunities?

3. **WAVE density oscillation measurability:** Can the hub-spoke WAVE be quantified? E.g., hub sections at ~200 words/viewport vs spoke sections at ~400 words/viewport creates a measurable 2x density oscillation.

4. **Split screen persistence vs collapse:** At what viewport width should the split screen (hub sidebar + spoke content) collapse? EXT-AXIS-CH-005 proposes 1440px. Is this too aggressive — should the split persist down to 1024px?

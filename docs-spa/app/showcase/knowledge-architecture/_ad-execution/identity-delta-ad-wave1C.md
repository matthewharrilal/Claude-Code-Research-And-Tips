## 1. NEW DISCOVERIES (>= 2 surprises)

### Surprise 1: Fourth Equivalence Mechanism — Gravitational (AD-F-022)
Choreography creates density through CONNECTION COUNT, not content volume. A hub with one sentence is denser than a spoke with three paragraphs because density is topological (how many things point to you), not volumetric. This is genuinely new — not a variation of temporal/spatial/proportional.

### Surprise 2: Meta-Equivalence = Attention Topology (AD-F-023)
The meta-equivalence that unifies all four mechanisms is ATTENTION TOPOLOGY:
- Axis geometry = the topology (shape of the attention map)
- Density = the traversal (how the journey feels)
- Organization = the semantics (why content is arranged this way)
Three names for one map. This answers the Wave 1B forward question #3 directly.

### Surprise 3: Compound Is Sequential, Not Simultaneous (AD-F-024)
Multiple axis patterns in ONE viewport = cacophony. The correct compound approach: each section commits to ONE pattern; compound emerges from the SEQUENCE through scroll time. Compound axis is fundamentally temporal.

### Surprise 4: Choreographic "Movement" Is Static (AD-F-020)
There is no actual movement in choreography — the reader moves, not the content. CSS transitions are attention cues, not animation. The choreographic "dance" is the reader's eye path through static structure.

## 2. CHALLENGES RESOLVED

### CLASS A (Confirming — 5)
- AD-F-017 (Kinetic equivalence): Choreography adds 4th mechanism
- AD-F-018 (Diagonal as dual signal): Confirms Z-pattern finding at choreographic scale
- AD-F-021 (Triple equivalence at compound scale): All mechanisms validated simultaneously
- AD-F-027 (DD-F-006 fractal at 5 scales): Compound confirmed
- AD-F-028 (No 6th fractal scale): 5-scale model is complete, not extensible

### CLASS B (Extending — 7)
- AD-F-019 (WAVE density is token-dependent, not geometry-dependent)
- AD-F-020 (Choreographic movement = reader movement through static structure)
- AD-F-022 (Fourth mechanism: gravitational)
- AD-F-023 (Meta-equivalence: attention topology)
- AD-F-024 (Compound is sequential, not simultaneous)
- AD-F-025 (Transition grammar validated)
- AD-F-026 (Meta-documentation IS the purest density test)

### CLASS C: NONE across all 3 waves (28 findings total)
The identity proved robust across all 6 explorations, all 8 density patterns, and all axis types including exotic ones (Spiral, Choreography, Compound).

### SOUL FAIL Patterns
- AD-005: Avoided box-shadow on hub-spoke connections
- AD-006: Avoided border-radius on compound grid cells, avoided rgba overlays for section transitions

## 3. FINAL RESEARCH GUIDANCE (for synthesis)

The AD phase has produced a complete picture:
- 4 equivalence mechanisms (temporal, spatial, proportional, gravitational)
- 1 meta-equivalence (attention topology)
- 28 findings (AD-F-001 through AD-F-028)
- 0 Class C/D challenges
- 0 soul violations

The synthesis should document the ATTENTION TOPOLOGY as the primary AD contribution to the identity.

## 4. FORWARD QUESTIONS (for CD phase)

1. Does the attention topology framework predict which COMBINATION patterns will work? If axis=topology, density=traversal, org=semantics, then CD should be topology COMBINATION.
2. Can the 4 mechanisms (temporal, spatial, proportional, gravitational) be mixed within a single CD exploration, or is compound-sequential the only viable approach?
3. Does attention topology have a FIFTH mechanism we haven't discovered?

## 5. EXT-AXIS-* REFERENCES

- EXT-AXIS-CH-001 through CH-005: Choreographic patterns
- EXT-AXIS-CO-001 through CO-008: Compound patterns (8 — highest of any exploration)

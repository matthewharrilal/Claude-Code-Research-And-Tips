## Master Mapping Table

| # | R2 ID | Description | SOUL | Target AD(s) | How It Applies | R-4 Synergy |
|---|-------|-------------|------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | R2-1.1 | Breaking the Grid (Intentional Mess) | PASS | AD-001, AD-003, AD-005, AD-006 | AD-001: Z-pattern traversal with strategic elements breaking column boundaries to direct the Z-scan. AD-003: Bento tiles that break grid alignment at transition points between task islands. AD-005: Choreographed spoke elements that extend beyond grid cells to create movement hierarchy. AD-006: Compound axis uses grid-breaks as mode-transition markers between organizational patterns. | R-2 grid-breaking + R-4 axis rhythm = intentional visual disruption guides axis reading order |
| 2 | R2-1.2 | Pull Quotes as Structural Elements | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-004, AD-006 | AD-001: Pull quotes as Z-pattern anchor points -- large serif text at Z-scan endpoints creates visual weight at strategic positions. AD-002: Pull quotes as CRESCENDO breathing pauses within the F-pattern vertical scan. AD-004: Pull quotes at spiral reveal waypoints summarize confidence level at each turn. AD-006: Meta-quotes ("Organization IS Density") placed at compound axis intersections. | R-2 pull quotes + R-4 information hierarchy = axis-aware content anchoring |
| 3 | R2-1.3 | Multi-Column Text with Visual Interruptions | PASS | AD-002, AD-003, AD-005 | AD-002: F-pattern exposition sections use multi-column for sparse introduction, collapsing to single-column for dense climax. AD-003: Bento grid islands with internal multi-column layouts for reference-heavy task content. AD-005: Hub pages with multi-column spoke summaries. | R-2 multi-column + R-4 viewport adaptation = axis-responsive column strategies |
| 4 | R2-1.4 | Running Headers and Section Markers | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-003, AD-004, AD-005, AD-006 | UNIVERSAL: Running headers become axis-orientation devices. AD-001: Z-pattern phase indicator (which Z-line the reader is on). AD-002: F-pattern act position indicator. AD-003: Bento grid section/island counter. AD-004: Spiral depth indicator (which ring/confidence level). AD-005: Choreography beat indicator. AD-006: Current axis mode indicator. | R-2 running headers + R-4 information hierarchy = persistent axis wayfinding |
| 5 | R2-1.5 | White Space as Content | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-003, AD-004, AD-005, AD-006 | UNIVERSAL: Whitespace encodes axis transitions. AD-001: Z-pattern diagonal whitespace creates the "Z" shape. AD-002: F-pattern left-margin whitespace narrows during CRESCENDO. AD-003: Bento grid gutter spacing as structural breathing. AD-004: Spiral reveal whitespace increases as confidence decreases (more speculative = more breathing room). AD-005: Choreographed whitespace between hub and spokes. AD-006: Mode-transition whitespace (48px+ per OD-F-007). | R-2 whitespace studies + R-4 density gradients = axis density integration |
| 6 | R2-2.1 | F-Pattern and Z-Pattern for Information Hierarchy | PASS | **AD-001**, **AD-002**, AD-003, AD-006 | AD-001: Z-PATTERN IS THE AXIS. This finding is the PRIMARY research source for AD-001's entire axis geometry. Primary content top-left, secondary top-right, scanning diagonal to bottom-left, conclusion bottom-right. AD-002: F-PATTERN IS THE AXIS. Primary research source for AD-002. Content placed where eyes naturally scan: top-left strongest, scanning rightward then dropping. AD-003: Bento grid element placement follows F/Z hierarchy (featured tiles in primary scan positions). AD-006: Compound axis uses Z-scan for the 6-pattern comparison grid. | R-2 F/Z-pattern + R-4 visual rhythm = foundational axis geometry definition |
| 7 | R2-2.2 | Card-Based Composition with Hierarchy Signals | PASS | AD-001, AD-003, AD-005, AD-006 | AD-001: Z-pattern cards with size hierarchy (2x2 featured at Z-start, 1x1 supporting at Z-middle). AD-003: Bento grid IS card composition -- this finding provides the hierarchy mechanism (span 2 featured, span 1 standard). AD-005: Choreographed spoke tiles as hierarchy-signaled cards. AD-006: Pattern gallery cards with size encoding compound importance. Soul condition: border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none on all cards. | R-2 card hierarchy + R-4 information hierarchy = axis-weighted card sizing |
| 8 | R2-2.3 | Dense but Breathable Interfaces | PASS | AD-003, AD-004, AD-005, AD-006 | AD-003: Bento grid islands dense internally (8px base unit) but breathable between islands (generous gaps). AD-004: Spiral reveal layers dense at established core, progressively more breathing room toward speculative edge. AD-005: Choreographed hub dense, spokes breathable at rest, dense when expanded. AD-006: Dense-but-breathable applied at fractal scale -- each compound axis zone balances density independently. | R-2 data visualization + R-4 information hierarchy = axis zone hierarchy |
| 9 | R2-2.4 | Analytical Dashboard Storylines | PASS | AD-002, AD-004, AD-006 | AD-002: F-pattern organized as narrative storyline: hero overview -> building blocks -> composite components. Validates CRESCENDO + F-pattern synergy. AD-004: Spiral reveal as analytical storyline from certainty core to exploration edge. AD-006: Compound axis as meta-storyline showing how all 5 patterns combine. | R-2 dashboard storylines + R-4 axis sequencing = narrative axis ordering |
| 10 | R2-3.1 | Maturity Badges and Component Status | PASS | AD-003, AD-004, AD-006 | AD-003: Bento grid tiles with status badges indicating task complexity (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced). Soul-safe: sharp-edged badges with locked palette colors. AD-004: HIGHEST RELEVANCE. Spiral reveal rings carry confidence badges (Established/Probable/Speculative/Open) -- this finding provides the visual mechanism for confidence stratification within spiral geometry. AD-006: Compound axis sections carry pattern-status badges. | R-2 maturity badges + R-4 semantic axis markers = confidence-encoded axis zones |
| 11 | R2-3.2 | Brand-Forward Documentation (Audi Pattern) | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-003, AD-004, AD-005, AD-006 | UNIVERSAL: Each AD connects its axis pattern to real documentation use cases, not abstract demonstrations. AD-001: Z-pattern shown through actual RSC tutorial content. AD-002: F-pattern shown through actual learning journey. AD-003: Bento grid shown through actual task workflows. AD-004: Spiral shown through actual decision-making content. AD-005: Choreography shown through actual navigation scenarios. AD-006: Compound shown through actual meta-documentation. | R-2 brand-forward + R-4 contextual axis = use-case-grounded axis demonstrations |
| 12 | R2-3.3 | Development Kitchen / Experimental Namespace | PASS | AD-006 | AD-006 ONLY: The compound creative axis includes experimental axis combinations that didn't make it into AD-001 through AD-005. A "Kitchen" section showing prototype axis patterns reinforces AD-006's role as the meta-exploration synthesis page. | R-2 experimental namespace + R-4 axis innovation = compound axis laboratory |
| 13 | R2-3.4 | Atomic Design Organization | PASS | AD-003, AD-004 | AD-003: Bento grid tiles organized by complexity: Atoms (single-step), Molecules (multi-step), Organisms (full workflows). Creates CRESCENDO within ISLANDS along the bento axis. AD-004: Spiral reveal rings map to atomic levels: Atoms at core (established facts), Molecules mid-ring (common patterns), Organisms outer ring (complex recommendations). | R-2 atomic organization + R-4 axis layering = complexity-graduated axis zones |
| 14 | R2-4.1 | Bento Grid Layout | PASS | **AD-003**, AD-005, AD-006 | AD-003: BENTO GRID IS THE AXIS. This finding is the PRIMARY research source for AD-003's axis geometry. 4-column grid with varied tile sizes (2x2 featured, 2x1 wide, 1x2 tall, 1x1 standard). AD-005: Choreographed hub page uses bento-like tile arrangement for spoke navigation. AD-006: Pattern gallery comparison uses bento layout (2x2 featured axis + 1x1 supporting axes). Soul condition: all tiles border-radius: 0. | R-2 bento grid + R-4 axis innovations = primary AD-003 axis structure |
| 15 | R2-4.2 | Asymmetric / Broken Grid Layouts | PASS | AD-001, AD-005, AD-006 | AD-001: Z-pattern inherently creates asymmetry -- content placement alternates left/right along the Z diagonal. This finding validates intentional asymmetry as a Z-pattern tool. AD-005: Choreographed spoke tiles with asymmetric sizing creates visual hierarchy without decoration. AD-006: Mode transitions between organizational patterns use asymmetric breaks to signal axis shifts. | R-2 asymmetric grid + R-4 axis rhythm = intentional axis asymmetry |
| 16 | R2-4.3 | CSS Grid with Fractional Units (fr) | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-003, AD-004, AD-005 | AD-001: Z-pattern expressed as `grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr` for primary/secondary zones at each Z-scan line. AD-002: F-pattern expressed as `2fr 1fr 1fr` -- wide left column for primary scan, narrower right columns for secondary content. AD-003: Bento grid tiles proportioned via fr units for natural hierarchy. AD-004: Spiral reveal sections widened/narrowed via fr units (established=wider, speculative=narrower per OD-F-001 width-as-density). AD-005: Hub-spoke grid with flexible fr-based proportions. | R-2 CSS Grid fr + R-4 axis proportions = proportional axis geometry via fr units |
| 17 | R2-4.4 | Golden Ratio Grid System | PARTIAL PASS | AD-002, AD-005 | AD-002: F-pattern content area at 61.8% width, secondary content at 38.2% creates mathematically harmonious axis proportions. LAYOUT ONLY -- typography values MUST use locked type scale (NOT golden ratio 1.618x scale). AD-005: Hub at 61.8%, spoke navigation sidebar at 38.2% creates natural balance. | R-2 golden ratio (layout only) + R-4 axis proportions = harmonious axis geometry |
| 18 | R2-4.5 | Swiss Design Grid System | PASS | **AD-003**, AD-005, AD-006 | AD-003: Swiss grid is the structural backbone for bento -- modular grid with consistent gutters creates orderly island arrangements. Directly supports AD-003's bento grid axis with classic sophistication. AD-005: Choreographed spoke page layouts use Swiss grid principles for clean, navigable structure. AD-006: Pattern gallery benefits from Swiss grid's "classic sophistication with modern flexibility." | R-2 Swiss grid + R-4 axis structure = foundational AD-003 grid discipline |
| 19 | R2-5.1 | Typography as Primary Design Element | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-004, AD-006 | AD-001: Questions in large Instrument Serif italic serve as Z-pattern anchor points -- typography IS the design element at each Z-scan endpoint. AD-002: F-pattern section headers as dramatic typography heroes, reinforcing the CRESCENDO arc progression. AD-004: Spiral reveal ring labels in large serif create axis waypoints. AD-006: Already strongest typography conviction -- validates compound axis approach. | R-2 typography-first + R-4 visual rhythm = typographic axis landmarks |
| 20 | R2-5.2 | Whitespace for Hierarchy | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-003, AD-004, AD-005, AD-006 | UNIVERSAL: Proximity principle applied to axis geometry. Headings closer to the content they introduce than preceding content. 1.5x rule: 1.5x more whitespace above heading than below. Applied to axis zones: elements within the same axis zone grouped tightly, generous separation between axis zones. AD-004 SPECIFIC: Spiral rings separated by progressively increasing whitespace from core to edge. | R-2 whitespace hierarchy + R-4 density gradients = axis-zone proximity grouping |
| 21 | R2-5.3 | Typographic Hierarchy Techniques | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-003, AD-004, AD-005, AD-006 | UNIVERSAL: Clamp-based responsive typography scale applied within axis layouts. Size, weight, and color as the ONLY differentiation tools across all axis zones. Two font pairings (Instrument Serif + Inter, with JetBrains Mono for code) maintained consistently across all AD axis geometries. Each axis level receives a distinct type size from the locked scale. | R-2 typographic hierarchy + R-4 information hierarchy = axis-level type scale mapping |
| 22 | R2-5.4 | Dramatic Typography as Content | PASS | AD-002, AD-004, AD-006 | AD-002: F-pattern act titles at dramatic display sizes (96px+) create CRESCENDO visual peaks. Tight letter-spacing (-0.02em) for display sizes. AD-004: Spiral reveal core label at largest display size, progressively smaller toward outer rings. AD-006: Section titles at dramatic scale signal compound axis mode transitions. | R-2 dramatic typography + R-4 visual rhythm = axis-peak typographic drama |
| 23 | R2-6.1 | Split Screen Layouts | PASS | AD-001, AD-004, AD-005 | AD-001: Z-pattern top section as 50/50 or 60/40 split creates the horizontal bar of the Z. AD-004: Spiral reveal with split screen showing established (one side) vs speculative (other side) simultaneously -- extends the spiral into a comparative axis. AD-005: Hub on one side, active spoke content on the other creates choreographed split-screen navigation. | R-2 split screen + R-4 viewport adaptation = axis-responsive split strategies |
| 24 | R2-6.2 | Overlapping/Layered Elements with Z-Index | **SOUL FAIL** | EXCLUDED | Contradicts Soul Piece 4 (shadows lie about depth, everything grounded on same plane). Overlapping creates implicit depth hierarchy via z-index. Matches anti-pattern: Decorative Grid Breaking + ANTI-PHYSICAL identity violation. | N/A -- EXCLUDED |
| 25 | R2-6.3 | Scrollytelling for Documentation | PASS | AD-002, AD-004, AD-005 | AD-002: Scrollytelling IS F-pattern CRESCENDO. Fixed sidebar showing narrative arc position while content scrolls -- natural fit for progressive disclosure axis. AD-004: Spiral reveal as scroll-driven journey from core to edge. Fixed confidence indicator updates as reader scrolls through strata. AD-005: Choreographed scroll-driven transitions between hub and spoke views. Must respect prefers-reduced-motion. | R-2 scrollytelling + R-4 axis sequencing = scroll-driven axis progression |
| 26 | R2-6.4 | Card Manipulation and Animation | **SOUL FAIL** | EXCLUDED | Liquid glass aesthetic requires box-shadow + border-radius > 0. Tactile shadows = box-shadow. 3D details = fake depth. All violate Soul Piece 4 and the ANTI-PHYSICAL identity. Matches anti-pattern: Hover Lift Effects. | N/A -- EXCLUDED |
| 27 | R2-6.5 | Copy-Paste Component Philosophy (shadcn/ui) | PASS | AD-001, AD-002, AD-003, AD-004, AD-005, AD-006 | UNIVERSAL: All AD explorations include prominent "copy code" buttons on axis layout CSS. The copy-paste philosophy (own the code, control the styling) aligns with KortAI's opinionated axis geometry. Each AD's axis layout CSS should be extractable and reusable. | R-2 copy-paste philosophy + R-4 axis portability = reusable axis layout patterns |

## R-2 / R-4 Synergy Pairings

| Synergy Category | R-2 Findings | R-4 Domain | Axis Integration |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Axis Rhythm Integration** | R2-1.1 (grid-breaking), R2-4.2 (asymmetric grid), R2-5.4 (dramatic type) | R-4 visual rhythm | Controlled visual disruption along axis geometry creates rhythm. Grid breaks at axis transition points signal reading direction changes. |
| **Axis Zone Hierarchy** | R2-2.3 (dense-but-breathable), R2-2.4 (dashboard storylines), R2-3.1 (maturity badges) | R-4 information hierarchy | Dense core zones with breathable periphery creates information hierarchy WITHIN axis geometry. Badges and storylines encode zone purpose. |
| **Axis Responsive Strategy** | R2-1.3 (multi-column), R2-4.3 (CSS Grid fr), R2-4.4 (golden ratio), R2-6.1 (split screen) | R-4 viewport adaptation | Fr-based proportional axis geometry adapts across viewports. Multi-column collapses to single-column. Split screens stack vertically. Golden ratio proportions scale. |
| **Axis Density Integration** | R2-1.5 (whitespace as content), R2-5.2 (whitespace hierarchy), R2-5.3 (typographic hierarchy) | R-4 density gradients | Whitespace encodes axis-zone density. Typography size maps to axis-zone importance. Proximity principle groups axis-zone elements. |
| **Axis Structural Foundation** | R2-4.1 (bento grid), R2-4.5 (Swiss grid), R2-2.1 (F/Z-pattern) | R-4 axis structure | Grid systems provide the skeletal axis geometry. F/Z patterns provide the reading-order logic. Together they define how content is placed and scanned. |
| **Axis Progressive Disclosure** | R2-6.3 (scrollytelling), R2-1.4 (running headers), R2-3.4 (atomic organization) | R-4 axis sequencing | Scroll-driven reveal along axis geometry.

## SOUL FAIL Analysis

### R2-6.2 (R2-024): Overlapping/Layered Elements with Z-Index

| Gate | Result | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| S1 (border-radius) | N/A | Not border-radius-dependent |
| S2 (box-shadow) | N/A | Not box-shadow-dependent |
| S3 (drop-shadow) | N/A | Not drop-shadow-dependent |
| S4 (opacity) | N/A | Not opacity-dependent |
| S5 (ANTI-PHYSICAL) | **FAIL** | Overlapping via z-index creates implicit depth hierarchy. Multiple items occupying same grid cells with z-index ordering simulates 3D stacking. Violates Soul Piece 4: "Nothing should float. Everything is GROUNDED on the same plane." |

**Conclusion:** EXCLUDED from all AD explorations. No workarounds possible -- the fundamental technique (z-index layering) is the soul violation.

### R2-6.4 (R2-026): Card Manipulation and Animation

| Gate | Result | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| S1 (border-radius) | **FAIL** | Liquid glass aesthetic requires border-radius > 0 |
| S2 (box-shadow) | **FAIL** | Tactile shadows require box-shadow |
| S3 (drop-shadow) | **FAIL** | 3D details require filter: drop-shadow() |
| S4 (opacity) | **FAIL** | Liquid glass requires opacity < 1.0 |
| S5 (ANTI-PHYSICAL) | **FAIL** | Every sub-technique (liquid glass, tactile shadows, 3D details, drag-and-drop reordering) implies physical manipulation of objects in 3D space |

**Conclusion:** EXCLUDED from all AD explorations. Fails ALL 5 gates simultaneously. Most comprehensive soul failure in the R-2 corpus.

## R2-4.4 (Golden Ratio) Partial Pass Note

R2-4.4 receives PARTIAL PASS status:
- **LAYOUT proportions (61.8%/38.2%):** PASS -- No soul violation. Mathematically harmonious axis geometry.
- **TYPOGRAPHY values (16px x 1.618 = 26px, etc.):** FAIL -- Deviates from locked type scale. The locked scale uses ~1.5x ratio (16px -> 24px -> 40px), NOT 1.618x (16px -> 26px -> 42px). Builders MUST NOT apply golden ratio to typography.

Only the layout proportion aspect is mapped to AD-002 and AD-005.

# Identity Checkpoint — Cumulative (Compaction-Safe)
## Last updated: Wave 1B | 2026-02-10

**Purpose:** Replaces reading v1.1 + all deltas after compaction.

---

## CURRENT IDENTITY STATE

**Core hypothesis:** Axis geometry SERVES org-density identity (3-way unification).
**Status:** VALIDATED across 4 explorations (Z-Pattern, F-Pattern, Bento Grid, Spiral).
**Mechanism:** POLYMORPHIC — temporal (Z/F), spatial (Bento), proportional (Spiral).

### All Findings (16 total)
| Range | Source | Key Discovery |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| AD-F-001-004 | AD-001 Z-Pattern | Z-PULSE equivalence, 3-way unification validated |
| AD-F-005-008 | AD-002 F-Pattern | Tension leads density, F-descent = CRESCENDO scanning |
| AD-F-009-012 | AD-003 Bento Grid | Grid CONTAINS islands, cell size IS island hierarchy |
| AD-F-013-016 | AD-004 Spiral | Angular spiral = geological strata, border-weight = depth |

### Identity Extensions (Class B — 5 total)
1. Temporal dimension: tension leads density (AD-F-005)
2. Scanning-density equivalence (AD-F-007)
3. Fractal ISLANDS at component scale (AD-F-011)
4. Compound density: BOOKENDS + ISLANDS at different scales (AD-F-012)
5. Confidence-proportional spacing = 3-way collapse (AD-F-015)

### Soul Compliance: 0 violations across 4 explorations

### Convention Status: FROZEN (all DRAFT → VALIDATED after Wave 1B)

### Research Guidance for Wave 1C (EXTENDING)
- DO: Seek novel properties of 3-way unification (kinetic? meta-equivalence?)
- DO: Test whether ALL density patterns co-exist in AD-006 compound
- DO NOT: Try to break equivalence (4 explorations confirmed it)

### Forward Questions (Wave 1C)
1. Does choreography introduce KINETIC equivalence?
2. Does simultaneous density co-existence hold in compound?
3. Is there a META-equivalence unifying temporal/spatial/proportional?

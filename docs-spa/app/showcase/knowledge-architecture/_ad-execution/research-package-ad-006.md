## 1. CHAIN TRAVERSAL

```
OD-006 Creative (37/40, v3 — CROWN JEWEL)
  ├── Density: ALL — FRACTAL primary (DD-F-006 at 5 scales)
  ├── 5th fractal scale (navigation) emerged from OD-006
  ├── OD-F-005: Organization IS Density (PROVEN HERE)
  ├── OD-F-006: Meta-documentation as purest density test
  ├── OD-F-007: Mode-transition breathing (48px+)
  ├── OD-F-008: Compound creative techniques exceed sum of parts
  ├── OD-F-013: OD-006 mode cycling proof
  └── ALL 6 OD patterns cycle with zero density manipulation
        ↓
AD-006 Compound Creative Axis
  ├── Compound: combines Z + F + Bento + Spiral + Choreography
  ├── Each section uses the axis pattern that serves its org-density
  ├── Pattern layering by section type for maximum effectiveness
  ├── Meta-documentation: content about axis patterns using those patterns
  └── DD-F-012: ALL density patterns → COMPOUND axis (fractal primary)
```

**Transitive Chain:** Creative (OD-F-005) → ALL patterns (FRACTAL primary) → Compound axis using all 5 prior patterns (DD-F-012, OD-F-FL-001)

**Why Compound for Creative:** AD-006 mirrors OD-006's role: it is the meta-exploration that demonstrates how all axis patterns work together. Just as OD-006 cycled through all 5 organizational modes to prove OD-F-005 (org IS density), AD-006 cycles through all 5 axis patterns to demonstrate how axis geometry serves the unified org-density phenomenon. It IS the synthesis page. It IS the crown jewel. It gets the most research because it must demonstrate everything the system has learned.

**Crown Jewel Expectations:**
- Highest finding count (this package has the most citations)
- Must demonstrate ALL 5 prior axis patterns in compound
- Must prove axis-density-org triple equivalence
- Must achieve DD-F-006 FRACTAL at 5 scales
- Must be meta-documentary (content about axis patterns demonstrates axis patterns)
- Target score: >= 36/40

## 3. R-2 FINDINGS (EMBEDDED)

### R2-3.3: Development Kitchen / Experimental Namespace

**AD-006 ONLY.** The compound creative axis includes experimental axis combinations that didn't make it into AD-001 through AD-005. A "Kitchen" section showing prototype axis patterns reinforces AD-006's role as the meta-exploration synthesis page. The kitchen contains: failed axis experiments (documented as learning), edge-case combinations (Z+Spiral, Bento+Choreography), and forward-looking AD-to-CD transition research.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-3.3 + R4-077 (decision matrix) = compound axis laboratory with classification framework.

---

### R2-2.4: Analytical Dashboard Storylines

**AD-006 Application:** Compound axis as meta-storyline showing how all 5 patterns combine. The "storyline" IS the compound demonstration: hero overview → Z-pattern section → F-pattern section → Bento section → Spiral section → Choreography section → synthesis conclusion. Each section is a chapter in the axis pattern story.

---

### R2-5.1: Typography as Primary Design Element

**AD-006 Application:** Already the strongest typography conviction page. Typography IS the compound's primary design element — each pattern section uses typography as its primary differentiator. Z sections use Instrument Serif headlines. F sections use Inter body hierarchy. Bento sections use JetBrains Mono task labels. The font itself signals which axis pattern is active.

---

### R2-2.1: F-Pattern and Z-Pattern for Information Hierarchy

**AD-006 Application:** Compound axis uses Z-scan for the 5-pattern comparison grid (pattern overview) and F-scan for individual pattern detail sections. The Z/F switch IS the compound's dual-mode: overview mode (Z) and detail mode (F).

---

### R2-2.2: Card-Based Composition with Hierarchy Signals

**AD-006 Application:** Pattern gallery cards with size encoding compound importance. AD-006's featured pattern (whichever scored highest) gets 2x2 card. Other patterns get 1x1. Size IS hierarchy. Soul condition: border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none.

---

### R2-2.3: Dense but Breathable Interfaces

**AD-006 Application:** Dense-but-breathable applied at FRACTAL scale. Each compound axis zone balances density independently: the overview section is sparse (pattern gallery), the detail sections are dense (full pattern demos), the synthesis section is medium (cross-pattern analysis).

---

### R2-4.5: Swiss Design Grid System

**AD-006 Application:** Pattern gallery benefits from Swiss grid's "classic sophistication with modern flexibility." The compound page uses a consistent 12-column Swiss grid, with each pattern section adapting the grid to its own axis geometry (Z uses 2-column, F uses 1-column, Bento uses 4-column, etc.). The GRID is consistent; the AXIS within it varies.

---

### R2-4.2: Asymmetric / Broken Grid Layouts

**AD-006 Application:** Mode transitions between organizational patterns use asymmetric breaks to signal axis shifts. The compound page deliberately uses asymmetric layout at transition points to say "the axis is changing now."

---

### R2-1.1: Breaking the Grid (Intentional Mess)

**AD-006 Application:** Compound axis uses grid-breaks as mode-transition markers between organizational patterns. When the Z section ends and the F section begins, a deliberate grid break signals the shift.

---

### R2-1.2: Pull Quotes as Structural Elements

**AD-006 Application:** Meta-quotes ("Organization IS Density") placed at compound axis intersections. Essence callouts in Instrument Serif italic mark the key insight moments where patterns combine to create emergent understanding.

---

### R2-1.4: Running Headers and Section Markers (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-006 Application:** Running headers become current axis mode indicators. "Currently demonstrating: Z-Pattern | Next: F-Pattern." The header IS the compound's table of contents in motion.

---

### R2-1.5: White Space as Content (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-006 Application:** Mode-transition whitespace (48px+ per OD-F-007) between compound sections. Whitespace IS the signal for "axis pattern changing." The whitespace budget is the highest of any AD — compound pages need the most breathing room.

---

### R2-5.2: Whitespace for Hierarchy (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-006 Application:** Proximity principle applied to compound sections: elements within the same axis zone grouped tightly (8px), generous separation between axis zones (48px+). 1.5x rule: 1.5x more whitespace above section headings than below.

---

### R2-5.3: Typographic Hierarchy Techniques (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-006 Application:** Clamp-based responsive typography across all compound axis levels. Each pattern section uses the full type scale: --type-page for section title, --type-section for subsections, --type-body for content. Consistency ACROSS pattern sections creates compound coherence.

---

### R2-6.5: Copy-Paste Component Philosophy (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-006 Application:** Each compound section's axis layout CSS is extractable and reusable. "Copy this Z-pattern layout." "Copy this F-pattern layout." The compound page IS a cookbook of axis patterns. Copy buttons on all layout CSS examples.

**Total R-2 Findings for AD-006: 15** (exceeds minimum of 8)

## 4. UNAPPLIED OD-F / DD-F FINDINGS CARRIED FORWARD

### From OD Stage

| Finding | What It Says | How AD-006 Should Apply |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| OD-F-005 | Organization IS Density (CROWN JEWEL) | AD-006 MUST demonstrate this. Each compound section uses a different org pattern, and the density shifts automatically. |
| OD-F-006 | Meta-documentation as purest density test | AD-006 IS meta-documentation. Content about axis patterns demonstrates axis patterns. |
| OD-F-007 | Mode-transition breathing (48px+) | Between every compound section (axis pattern shift), 48px+ breathing zone. |
| OD-F-008 | Compound creative techniques exceed sum of parts | Apply multiple creative techniques per section: solid offset + editorial drop + semantic bridge simultaneously. |
| OD-F-013 | OD-006 mode cycling proof | AD-006 mirrors this: cycle through all 5 axis patterns with zero forced density manipulation. |
| OD-F-009 | Narrative CRESCENDO | The compound page itself follows CRESCENDO: simple patterns first, compound synthesis last. |
| OD-F-010 | Typography size reduction mirrors density | Within compound sections, typography compresses as content densifies. |
| OD-F-011 | Tension meters as wayfinding | Compound section indicator shows which axis pattern is currently active. |
| OD-F-012 | Code absence as anticipation | Compound overview section has zero code. First code appears in Z-pattern section. |

### From DD Stage

| Finding | What It Says | How AD-006 Should Apply |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| DD-F-006 | FRACTAL: self-similarity at 5 scales | MOST CRITICAL. AD-006 must demonstrate 5-scale fractal: navigation (pattern menu), page (compound flow), section (within-pattern demo), component (layout examples), character (code sparse/dense). |
| DD-F-007 | Consistency > variety | Despite using 5 different axis patterns, the COMPOUND must feel consistent via shared tokens, type scale, and border system. |
| DD-F-010 | Org serves density — elevated by OD-F-005 | Each axis pattern serves its org-density. The compound demonstrates this for ALL patterns. |
| DD-F-012 | Density implies axis (CORE AD CONSTRAINT) | AD-006 demonstrates all 5 density→axis implications simultaneously. |
| DD-F-014 | Max 2 callouts per viewport | Even in dense compound sections, max 2 callouts visible. |
| DD-F-015 | No traffic-light color adjacency | Across all compound sections, no green+red callout adjacency. |

---

## 5. EXT-AXIS-X FINDINGS (Bespoke External Research for Compound)

### EXT-AXIS-X-001: Compound Axis as Meta-Pattern Demonstration

**Description:** Just as DD-F-006 (FRACTAL) is the meta-pattern governing all density work, and OD-F-MP-001 (Org=Density) is the meta-pattern governing all organizational work, the compound axis should demonstrate a THIRD meta-pattern: that axis geometry, organizational pattern, and density pattern are THREE perspectives on ONE phenomenon. This "Triple Equivalence" would be the AD stage's crown jewel discovery: org = density = axis.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Conceptual/structural principle. No CSS requirements. The triple equivalence is demonstrated through content arrangement, not decoration.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Triple-column comparison section: Organization column | Density column | Axis column — same content described three ways
2. Visual proof: changing the axis pattern changes the perceived density AND organization
3. Annotation layer (per EXT-CREATIVE-010) labeling each perspective in real time

---

### EXT-AXIS-X-002: Pattern Transition Grammar

**Description:** Compound axis needs a grammar for HOW patterns transition. Not all transitions are equal: Z→F is natural (both scanning patterns). Bento→Spiral is jarring (grid→proportional). Choreography bridges any two patterns. A transition grammar defines: which transitions are smooth (compatible), which need breathing zones (incompatible), and which benefit from bridge sections (choreography-mediated).

**Soul Test:** PASS — Information architecture. No CSS implications. The grammar governs content structure decisions, not visual decoration.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Transition compatibility matrix: 5x5 grid showing smooth/bridge/breathing for each pattern pair
2. Bridge sections between incompatible pattern transitions (48px+ breathing per OD-F-007)
3. Choreography section acts as universal bridge between any two patterns

---

### EXT-AXIS-X-003: Recursive Pattern Echo Grid

**Description:** EXT-CREATIVE-013 established pattern echo (miniature visual signatures of each OD in the visual index). For compound axis, extend this: create a 5-cell pattern echo grid where each cell contains a miniature CSS-only visualization of its axis pattern. The Z cell shows a miniature Z diagonal. The F cell shows a miniature F scan. The Bento cell shows a miniature grid. The Spiral cell shows angular approximation. The Choreography cell shows hub-spoke arrows. AD-006 includes a SELF-REFERENCING cell showing the compound grid itself (Hofstadterian strange loop).

**Soul Test:** PASS — Flat CSS graphics. border-radius: 0. No box-shadow. Each echo uses only locked colors and sharp geometric shapes. The self-reference creates DD-F-006 fractal at navigation scale (5th scale).

**Signature Elements:**
1. 5-cell grid with CSS-only miniature pattern visualizations
2. Each cell 80x80px with 1px border, sharp corners, locked palette
3. 6th cell (compound) contains recursive miniature of the 5-cell grid itself

---

### EXT-AXIS-X-004: Compound Density Self-Documentation

**Description:** OD-005's WAVE indicator showed density in real time (EXT-SPAT-018). AD-006 should show AXIS PATTERN in real time. A persistent annotation showing "Current axis: Z-Pattern | Density: PULSE | Organization: Conversational" updates as the reader scrolls through compound sections. This makes the triple equivalence VISIBLE — readers can see that axis, density, and organization all change simultaneously.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Uses --font-mono at --type-meta size. Persistent sidebar or header annotation. No animation (static update via intersection observer with reduced-motion fallback). Square markers (Soul Piece 5).

**Signature Elements:**
1. Persistent annotation: `position: sticky; top: 0;` with current axis/density/org labels
2. Labels in --font-mono, --type-meta, --color-text-secondary
3. Updates via CSS intersection observer (or static alternative with reduced-motion)

---

### EXT-AXIS-X-005: Compound Fractal Annotation Layer

**Description:** EXT-CREATIVE-010 created the fractal annotation layer for OD-006 (labeling current fractal scale). AD-006 extends this to annotate BOTH fractal scale AND axis pattern. The annotation layer shows two dimensions simultaneously: "PAGE scale | Z-Pattern axis" → "SECTION scale | F-Pattern axis" → "COMPONENT scale | Bento axis." This makes the compound axis structure visible at every fractal level.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Uses --font-mono, --type-meta, --color-text-secondary. CSS Grid sidebar annotations. No animation, no decoration. Editorial marginalia tradition.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Two-line annotation per section: Line 1 = fractal scale, Line 2 = axis pattern
2. `grid-template-columns: 3rem 1fr;` — narrow annotation column + wide content column
3. Annotations in --font-mono at 12px, rotated 90 degrees (flat CSS transform, static)

---

### EXT-AXIS-X-006: Culmination Spread Treatment

**Description:** EXT-CREATIVE-011 established the culmination spread for OD-006 (amplified title, retrospective integration, per-section grid variation). AD-006 mirrors this: the compound page IS the culmination of the AD stage. The opening section uses the maximum type scale (--type-page at 1.75rem + amplification). Miniature retrospective thumbnails of AD-001 through AD-005 show the compound's lineage. Each pattern section's grid variation matches its source AD's natural layout.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Amplified typography uses TOP of locked scale. Miniature thumbnails are flat CSS graphics. Per-section grid variation is structural, not decorative. All soul-compliant.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Opening title at amplified --type-page (can use larger if justified editorially)
2. Miniature thumbnails of AD-001 through AD-005 as CSS-only pattern echoes
3. Per-section grid variation matching each pattern's natural geometry

---

### EXT-AXIS-X-007: Decision Matrix as Compound Climax

**Description:** OD-F-013 established decision matrices as natural climax components. AD-006's compound page climaxes with a 5-pattern decision matrix: rows = content types (landing, tutorial, reference, guide, creative), columns = axis patterns (Z, F, Bento, Spiral, Choreography). Each cell rated: "Best fit", "Acceptable", "Poor fit." The matrix IS the compound synthesis — it transforms 5 individual pattern explorations into a unified selection framework.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Flat table. Horizontal rules only (no vertical borders per anti-pattern registry). Sharp corners. Rating labels use text, not color coding (IS-7 trusts reader's intelligence). No traffic-light semantics (DD-F-015).

**Signature Elements:**
1. 5x5 matrix (content types × axis patterns)
2. Ratings as text labels: "Best fit" / "Acceptable" / "Avoid"
3. Featured cells (Best fit) with 4px left border accent in --color-primary

---

### EXT-AXIS-X-008: Compound Page as AD-F Finding Generator

**Description:** Just as OD-006 generated the crown jewel discovery (OD-F-005: org IS density), AD-006 should be designed to GENERATE findings, not just demonstrate patterns. The compound page structure should make emergent patterns visible — when Z-pattern meets Bento grid, what new behavior emerges? When F-pattern meets Spiral, what unexpected interaction occurs? Documented as AD-F findings in real time during building.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Process principle. No CSS implications. The finding generation is a building methodology, not a visual technique.

**Signature Elements:**
1. "Discovery Log" sidebar section documenting AD-F findings as they emerge
2. Each compound transition point annotated with "What did we discover here?"
3. Finding IDs (AD-F-021 through AD-F-028) reserved for compound-emergent discoveries

---

## 6. SIGNATURE ELEMENTS SUMMARY

| Finding | Signature Element 1 | Signature Element 2 | Signature Element 3 |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| EXT-AXIS-X-001 | Triple-column org/density/axis comparison | Visual proof: axis change → density change | Annotation layer labels all three |
| EXT-AXIS-X-002 | 5x5 transition compatibility matrix | Bridge sections between incompatible pairs | Choreography as universal bridge |
| EXT-AXIS-X-003 | 5-cell pattern echo grid (CSS-only) | Each cell 80x80px miniature | 6th cell self-references (strange loop) |
| EXT-AXIS-X-004 | Persistent axis/density/org annotation | --font-mono at --type-meta | Updates via intersection observer |
| EXT-AXIS-X-005 | Two-line annotation: scale + pattern | 3rem annotation column | --font-mono rotated 90 degrees |
| EXT-AXIS-X-006 | Amplified opening title | Miniature AD thumbnails | Per-section grid variation |
| EXT-AXIS-X-007 | 5x5 content×pattern decision matrix | Text ratings (not color) | Featured cells with 4px left border |

## 7. SOUL FAIL FINDINGS (Reference Only — NOT for Application)

| Finding ID | Description | Why It Fails | Gate Violated |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| R4-181 | 3D Bento with CSS perspective | 3D transforms | G2, G5, G6, G7 |
| R4-182 | Parallax scroll depth | ANTI-PHYSICAL canonical | G6 |
| R4-183 | Elements with box-shadow floating | box-shadow: none | G2 |
| R4-184 | Rounded overlapping elements | border-radius > 0 | G1, G8 |
| R4-185 | Hover shadow/lift | Animated z-movement | G2, G5 |
| R4-186 | Pill-shaped progress bars | border-radius violation | G1, G8 |
| R4-187 | Rounded masonry frames | border-radius > 0 | G1 |
| R4-188 | Rounded tab shapes | Physical affordance | G1 |
| R4-189 | Gradient reveal animation | Material interaction | G7 |
| R4-190 | Backdrop blur modal | Filter effects | G3, G7 |
| R4-191 | Diagonal gradient transitions | Light interaction | G7 |
| R4-192 | Semi-transparent overlays | opacity < 1.0 | G4 |

**AD-006 Specific Risk:** As the crown jewel with the most compound techniques, AD-006 has the highest surface area for soul violations. Every section uses a different axis pattern, each with its own soul risks. The compound effect can create "violation drift" — individually soul-safe elements may combine to create emergent violations (e.g., multiple transparent layers overlapping to create shadow-like effects). Binary rule: verify opacity === 1.0 on ALL elements in ALL sections. Verify border-radius: 0 across ALL pattern sections.

1. **Triple Equivalence:** EXT-AXIS-X-001 proposes org = density = axis. Does this hold? If axis geometry changes and density/org change WITH it automatically, this confirms the triple equivalence. If axis changes require separate density/org adjustments, the triple equivalence fails and we have only double (org = density, axis serves both).

2. **Transition grammar viability:** EXT-AXIS-X-002 proposes smooth/bridge/breathing transitions. Does this classification hold for all 25 pattern pairs (5x5)? Which transitions are genuinely problematic?

3. **Compound fractal scale count:** OD-006 discovered a 5th fractal scale (navigation). Does AD-006 discover a 6th? The compound page's meta-structure (pattern selection → pattern demonstration → pattern synthesis) might constitute a "strategy" scale above navigation.

4. **Soul Piece #6 candidacy:** No cognitive soul piece was discovered in OD. Could AD discover a SPATIAL soul piece? If axis geometry has soul implications (e.g., "content MUST flow vertically before horizontally"), this would be Soul Piece #6.

5. **Crown jewel score target:** OD-006 achieved 37/40. AD-006 should target >= 36/40. The compound page's complexity makes high scores harder (more surface area for violations) but the meta-documentary nature makes density rhythm more natural (OD-F-006).

### R-2/R-4 Synergy Pairings for AD-006

| Synergy | R-2 Source | R-4 Source | Axis Integration |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Compound Structure | R2-2.4 (dashboard storylines) | R4-080 (orchestrated flow) | Meta-storyline across all patterns |
| Compound Kitchen | R2-3.3 (experimental namespace) | R4-077 (decision matrix) | Experimental axis combinations |
| Compound Typography | R2-5.1 (typography as design) | R4-048 (type scale rhythm) | Font signals active axis pattern |
| Compound Density | R2-2.3 (dense-but-breathable) | R4-095 (layer by section type) | Per-section density independence |
| Compound Grid | R2-4.5 (Swiss grid) | R4-084 (bento span syntax) | Consistent grid, variable axis |
| Compound Disclosure | R2-6.5 (copy-paste philosophy) | R4-069 (progressive disclosure) | Extractable axis layout CSS |

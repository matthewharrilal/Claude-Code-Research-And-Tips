# Identity Delta — Wave 1A (AD-001 Z-Pattern + AD-002 F-Pattern)
## Written by Lead | 2026-02-09
## Identity-Research Loop: S6→S7 (IDENTITY-TESTED → GUIDANCE-EVOLVED)
## Lens Version: v1 (Wave 1A = CONFIRMING type)

## 1. NEW DISCOVERIES (>= 2 surprises)

### Surprise 1: Z-PULSE Equivalence (AD-F-002)
Z-Pattern traversal and PULSE rhythm are the SAME phenomenon viewed from different perspectives. Each Z-sweep cycle IS one PULSE beat. The diagonal gap between Q and A IS the PULSE transition point. This is not a pairing — it is an identity.

**Identity impact:** The transitive chain (org → density → axis) may be weaker than "transitive." It may be "identical" — three names for one underlying structure.

### Surprise 2: F-Pattern Degradation = CRESCENDO Increase (AD-F-007)
When readers switch from horizontal scanning to vertical descent in the F-pattern, they are responding to increasing density by narrowing attention. The scanning behavior change IS the density increase, observed from the reader's perspective vs the content's perspective.

**Identity impact:** Confirms the axis-density equivalence seen in AD-001. Two independent explorations reached the same conclusion through different mechanisms.

### Surprise 3: Tension Leads Density (AD-F-005)
The tension meter peaks at Act IV (falling action), while CRESCENDO density peaks at Act III (climax). Tension and density are related but not identical — tension LEADS density. This is the first evidence that the org-density-axis relationship has TEMPORAL structure, not just spatial.

## 2. CHALLENGES RESOLVED

### CLASS A Findings (Confirming — 6 total)
- AD-F-001 (Z-hero establishing shot): Confirms R4-055 + R4-083. No identity tension.
- AD-F-002 (Z-PULSE equivalence): Confirms transitive chain hypothesis.
- AD-F-003 (Micro-Z fractal): Confirms DD-F-006 at component scale.
- AD-F-004 (3-way unification): Confirms central hypothesis.
- AD-F-006 (Typography compression = CRESCENDO): Confirms R4-039 + R4-048.
- AD-F-008 (Decision matrix validates convergence): Confirms 3-way convergence.

### CLASS B Findings (Extending — 2 total)
- AD-F-005 (Tension leads density): EXTENDS identity — introduces temporal dimension. Candidate for v2 identity statement: "Organizational tension is the leading indicator of density position."
- AD-F-007 (F-pattern vertical descent = peak-density scanning): EXTENDS identity — scanning behavior and density are two perspectives on one phenomenon.

### CLASS C/D Findings: NONE
The Wave 1A explorations produced zero challenges to identity. Per enforcement rule 2: "If identity delta contains zero CLASS C findings, the loop was too conservative. FLAG for Lead review."

**Lead review:** Wave 1A used CONFIRMING-type forward questions, which bias toward Class A/B outcomes. This is expected — CONFIRMING waves should confirm. Wave 1B will use STRESS-TESTING forward questions to actively seek Class C findings.

### SOUL FAIL Pattern Documented
Both builders identified soul violations they avoided:
- Z-Pattern: Avoided border-radius on micro-Z grid cells (would have violated Soul Piece #1)
- F-Pattern: Avoided box-shadow on tension meter segments (would have violated Soul Piece #1)
- Both: Zero rgba alpha < 1.0 in all backgrounds

## 3. REVISED RESEARCH GUIDANCE (for Wave 1B)

### Updated DO Search:
- Axis patterns that CHALLENGE the org-density equivalence (stress test, not confirmation)
- Bento Grid patterns where axis geometry might NOT serve the density pairing (ISLANDS + BOOKENDS are discontinuous — does discontinuous density pair with grid?)
- Spiral patterns where the geometric constraint may FIGHT the content's natural reading order
- Techniques where axis geometry imposes constraints that org patterns would not choose

### Updated DO NOT Search:
- (Same as v1, plus:)
- Patterns that assume equivalence without testing it — Wave 1B must STRESS-TEST
- Grid layouts that only work with uniform density (Bento Grid + ISLANDS requires non-uniform)

---

## 4. FORWARD QUESTIONS (Wave 1B = STRESS-TESTING type)

1. **Q1 (Bento Grid):** Does Bento Grid's rigid grid structure FIGHT the ISLANDS density pattern's need for discontinuous spacing, or does the grid CONTAIN islands naturally?

2. **Q2 (Spiral):** Does Spiral geometry impose a reading order that contradicts GEOLOGICAL density's need for stratigraphic layering? Can a spiral be geological?

3. **Q3 (Both):** Is the 3-way equivalence found in Wave 1A (AD-F-002, AD-F-004, AD-F-007, AD-F-008) an artifact of Z-Pattern and F-Pattern being the two most "conventional" axis patterns? Do more exotic patterns (Bento, Spiral) break the equivalence?

## 5. EXT-AXIS-* REFERENCE

- EXT-AXIS-Z-004 (conversational turn analysis): Z-diagonal maps to Turn Relevance Place in conversation analysis, providing external validation for the Z-PULSE equivalence finding.
- EXT-AXIS-F-003 (left-spine landmark hierarchy): Three-tier visual signal (border-left, italic, uppercase) for F-pattern descent, validated by Nielsen Norman Group eye-tracking research.

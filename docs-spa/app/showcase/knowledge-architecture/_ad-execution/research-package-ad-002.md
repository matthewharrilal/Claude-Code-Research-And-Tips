## 1. CHAIN TRAVERSAL

```
OD-002 Narrative (35/40, v3)
  ├── Density: CRESCENDO (DD-F-002)
  ├── DD-F-006 FRACTAL: mandatory at 5 scales
  ├── OD-F-009: Narrative arc creates CRESCENDO naturally
  ├── OD-F-010: Typography size reduction mirrors density
  ├── OD-F-011: Tension meters as narrative wayfinding
  ├── OD-F-012: Code absence as anticipation device
  ├── OD-F-013: Decision matrices as natural climax
  └── OD-F-005: Organization IS Density (MANDATORY)
        ↓
AD-002 F-Pattern Axis
  ├── F-pattern: horizontal top scan, shorter second scan, vertical left descent
  ├── Pairs with CRESCENDO: sparse exposition → dense climax → sparse denouement
  ├── Left-aligned headings guide the F vertical descent = CRESCENDO navigation
  └── DD-F-012: density implies axis — CRESCENDO implies single-column vertical flow
```

**Transitive Chain:** Narrative (OD-F-005) → CRESCENDO (DD-F-002) → F-Pattern single-column vertical flow (DD-F-012, OD-F-FL-001)

**Why F-Pattern for Narrative:** F-pattern follows progressive vertical scanning — the eye reads the first few lines fully, then increasingly scans only the left edge. This mirrors CRESCENDO perfectly: the reader engages deeply with early sparse content (full F-horizontal scans), then transitions to scanning behavior as density increases (vertical left-descent through dense content). The Freytag 5-beat arc maps to F-pattern zones: exposition = full scan, rising = shorter scans, climax = vertical descent through peak density, falling = relaxing scan, denouement = final wide scan.

## 2. R-4 FINDINGS (SOUL PASS + CONDITIONAL PASS)

### SOUL PASS Findings (16)

| # | Finding ID | Description | How AD-002 Should Apply |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | R4-006 | F-pattern: horizontal top scan, shorter second scan, vertical left descent | PRIMARY axis geometry — this IS the F-pattern. Narrative exposition uses full horizontal scan; climax uses vertical descent. |
| 2 | R4-007 | F-pattern: top content gets most attention, right side often ignored | Place Freytag exposition (Act I) at top for maximum attention. Supplementary content in right columns. |
| 3 | R4-008 | F-pattern: left-aligned content is scanned vertically | Left-aligned headings form the CRESCENDO navigation spine. H2/H3 headings on left = Freytag act markers. |
| 4 | R4-009 | F-pattern optimization: bold headings on left side, bullet points for scanability | Freytag act titles in bold Instrument Serif on left. Bullet points for key concepts within each act. |
| 5 | R4-010 | F-pattern: front-load important information in first sentences | Freytag exposition front-loads the inciting incident per EXT-NARR-002. First paragraph = highest attention. |
| 6 | R4-011 | F-pattern: key information in first two paragraphs | Act I (exposition) contains 2 key paragraphs: problem statement + promise of resolution. |
| 7 | R4-039 | Progressive rhythm: elements change progressively (crescendo/diminuendo) | Maps DIRECTLY to CRESCENDO. Typography shrinks (28px→20px per OD-F-010), spacing compresses, content densifies. |
| 8 | R4-042 | Breaking established rhythm creates focal points | Rhythm break at Freytag climax (Act III). Decision matrix or key code block breaks the progressive pattern. |
| 9 | R4-044 | Musical rest = whitespace/breathing room | Freytag falling action (Act IV) = musical rest after climax density. Whitespace recovery zone. |
| 10 | R4-048 | Progressive scaling via type scale creates rhythm | 28px (Act I) → 24px (Act II) → 20px (Act III) → 22px (Act IV) → 24px (Act V). Locked type scale values. |
| 11 | R4-052 | Shot progression: wide (context) → close (detail) → wide (synthesis) | Maps to Freytag arc: exposition (wide) → climax (close-up on code) → denouement (wide synthesis). |
| 12 | R4-054 | Slow panning creates contemplation — generous whitespace for explanations | Act I exposition uses generous whitespace. IS-7 (Unhurried Editor) governs the opening. |
| 13 | R4-055 | Establishing shots orient before diving into details | Act I = establishing shot. "Here's what we're exploring." Sets narrative context. |
| 14 | R4-069 | Progressive disclosure: reduce cognitive load by revealing gradually | F-pattern + progressive disclosure = CRESCENDO mechanism. Reveal complexity gradually through Freytag acts. |
| 15 | R4-071 | Progressive disclosure: start simple, let users drill down | Act I simple → Act II complex → Act III expert. Trust reader's intelligence (IS-7). |
| 16 | R4-074 | Progressive disclosure: keep essential info visible | Act structure (5 act markers) always visible as left-aligned headings in F-pattern vertical spine. |

### Additional SOUL PASS (Universal — apply to AD-002)

| # | Finding ID | Description | How AD-002 Should Apply |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 17 | R4-013 | Reading gravity creates diagonal path | Within each Freytag act, reading gravity governs paragraph scanning. |
| 18 | R4-036 | Five types of visual rhythm | CRESCENDO = PROGRESSIVE rhythm type. Progressive change throughout. |
| 19 | R4-045 | Accent = breaking pattern for emphasis | Red accent (#E83025) at climax decision matrix. The ONLY accent in the narrative. |
| 20 | R4-046 | Repeated spacing creates rhythm | Consistent paragraph spacing within each act. Spacing compresses act-over-act. |
| 21 | R4-049 | Consistent alignment patterns create rhythm | Left-aligned headings throughout. The F-pattern LEFT SPINE is the consistency anchor. |
| 22 | R4-050 | Cinematic establishing shot = context/overview | Act I = establishing shot. Wide view of the topic before diving in. |
| 23 | R4-051 | Cinematic close-up = detail focus | Act III climax = close-up on specific code patterns, parameters, architecture. |
| 24 | R4-085 | Details section combines F-pattern with progressive disclosure | Acts II-III use F-pattern scanning for detailed content with expandable sections. |
| 25 | R4-087 | Regular rhythm for body content | Within each act, regular paragraph rhythm (consistent spacing, repeating structure). |
| 26 | R4-098 | Pattern decision matrix with complexity ratings | Useful at Act III climax — the comparison/decision point of the narrative. |

### CONDITIONAL PASS Findings (6)

| # | Finding ID | Description | Adaptation Required | How AD-002 Should Apply |
|---|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 27 | R4-086 | Tab navigation for concept switching within F-pattern | Flat tabs (no rounded corners, no shadows). | Within Act II, tabs switch between implementation approaches. Border-bottom active indicator. |
| 28 | R4-116 | Scroll-based progressive disclosure | No scroll-jacking or parallax. Natural scroll + intersection observer. | Freytag tension meter updates via scroll position. Reduced-motion prophylactic. |
| 29 | R4-123 | Alternating colors create rhythm | Colors within locked palette only. | Zone backgrounds shift subtly across acts: sparse cream → denser warm gray → sparse cream. |
| 30 | R4-124 | Cinematic: jump cuts for urgency | "Jump cuts" = abrupt section transitions via spacing changes, not animation. | Between Acts II and III, spacing compresses abruptly to signal rising tension. |
| 31 | R4-125 | Cinematic: slow panning for contemplation | "Slow panning" = generous whitespace and long-form text, not CSS animation. | Act I uses generous margins and line-height. IS-7 unhurried pacing. |
| 32 | R4-144 | Tutorial/guide: F-pattern for main content | Ensure left-side headings use locked typography. | Standard F-pattern is soul-compatible with Instrument Serif headings. |

**Total R-4 Findings for AD-002: 32** (exceeds minimum of 15)

## 3. R-2 FINDINGS (EMBEDDED)

### R2-2.1: F-Pattern and Z-Pattern for Information Hierarchy (PRIMARY)

**AD-002: F-PATTERN IS THE AXIS.** This finding is the PRIMARY research source for AD-002's entire axis geometry. Content placed where eyes naturally scan: top-left strongest, scanning rightward then dropping. F-pattern left-vertical spine becomes the CRESCENDO navigation mechanism — headings on the left mark Freytag act positions, and the vertical descent mirrors the progressive density build.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-2.1 + R4-006/R4-008 = foundational F-axis geometry definition.

---

### R2-5.4: Dramatic Typography as Content

**AD-002 Application:** F-pattern act titles at dramatic display sizes create CRESCENDO visual peaks. Act I title at 40px (largest), progressively smaller through Act V. Tight letter-spacing (-0.02em) for display sizes. The typography compression IS the CRESCENDO — visible in the F-pattern left spine.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-5.4 + R4-048 (progressive type scale) = axis-peak typographic drama.

---

### R2-6.3: Scrollytelling for Documentation

**AD-002 Application:** Scrollytelling IS F-pattern CRESCENDO. Fixed sidebar showing narrative arc position while content scrolls. The sidebar displays Freytag 5-beat structure with current position highlighted. Natural fit for progressive disclosure axis. Must respect prefers-reduced-motion.

**R-4 Synergy:** R2-6.3 + R4-116 (scroll-based disclosure) = scroll-driven axis progression.

---

### R2-4.4: Golden Ratio Grid System (PARTIAL PASS — Layout Only)

**AD-002 Application:** F-pattern content area at 61.8% width, sidebar at 38.2% creates harmonious axis proportions. The tension meter / act indicator sidebar occupies the 38.2% secondary zone while narrative content occupies the 61.8% primary zone. Typography values MUST use locked type scale (NOT golden ratio scale).

---

### R2-2.4: Analytical Dashboard Storylines

**AD-002 Application:** F-pattern organized as narrative storyline: hero overview → building blocks → composite components. Validates CRESCENDO + F-pattern synergy. The "storyline" IS the Freytag arc, and the dashboard layout IS the F-pattern scanning structure.

---

### R2-1.2: Pull Quotes as Structural Elements

**AD-002 Application:** Pull quotes as CRESCENDO breathing pauses within the F-pattern vertical scan. Essence callouts in Instrument Serif italic placed between Freytag acts serve as editorial rest stops. They break the progressive density build momentarily, providing cognitive recovery per EXT-NARR-006.

---

### R2-1.3: Multi-Column Text with Visual Interruptions

**AD-002 Application:** F-pattern exposition sections (Act I) use multi-column for sparse introduction, collapsing to single-column for dense climax (Act III). The column count itself encodes density: 2-column = sparse, 1-column = dense. This IS CRESCENDO at the layout level.

---

### R2-1.4: Running Headers and Section Markers (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-002 Application:** Running headers become F-pattern act position indicators. A persistent header shows which Freytag act the reader is in: "Act I: Exposition" → "Act III: Climax." Updates as reader scrolls through the F-pattern vertical descent.

---

### R2-1.5: White Space as Content (UNIVERSAL)

**AD-002 Application:** Whitespace encodes CRESCENDO within F-pattern. Act I has generous whitespace (sparse). Whitespace compresses through Act II → Act III (progressive densification). Act IV (falling action) restores whitespace as denouement breathing.

---

### R2-5.1: Typography as Primary Design Element

**AD-002 Application:** F-pattern section headers as dramatic typography heroes, reinforcing the CRESCENDO arc progression. Each act title is a typographic event — Instrument Serif at display size, creating the F-pattern's left-spine landmarks that guide vertical scanning.

**Total R-2 Findings for AD-002: 10** (exceeds minimum of 5)

## 4. UNAPPLIED OD-F / DD-F FINDINGS CARRIED FORWARD

### From OD Stage

| Finding | What It Says | How AD-002 Should Apply |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| OD-F-009 | Narrative arc creates CRESCENDO naturally | The Freytag 5-beat structure (exposition→rising→climax→falling→denouement) IS CRESCENDO. F-pattern vertical descent mirrors the progressive build. |
| OD-F-010 | Typography size reduction mirrors density | Heading sizes: 28px (Act I) → 24px (Act II) → 20px (Act III) → 22px (Act IV) → 24px (Act V). Locked type scale values. |
| OD-F-011 | Tension meters as narrative wayfinding | Fixed sidebar tension meter shows position within Freytag arc. Square markers (Soul Piece 5). |
| OD-F-012 | Code absence as anticipation device | No code blocks in Act I (exposition). First code appears in Act II. Strategic withholding creates narrative tension. |
| OD-F-013 | Decision matrices as natural climax | Act III (climax) contains a decision matrix — the densest component at the CRESCENDO peak. |
| OD-F-007 | Mode-transition breathing | Between Freytag acts, 48px+ breathing zones prevent cognitive whiplash. |

### From DD Stage

| Finding | What It Says | How AD-002 Should Apply |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| DD-F-002 | CRESCENDO (sparse→dense) creates narrative progression | F-pattern scanning behavior naturally follows CRESCENDO: deep reading (sparse) → scanning (dense). |
| DD-F-006 | FRACTAL: self-similarity at 5 scales | F-pattern at page scale (full page F), section scale (within-act F), component scale (code-explanation F). |
| DD-F-014 | Max 2 callouts per viewport | Within dense Act III content, never stack more than 2 callouts. |
| DD-F-015 | No traffic-light color adjacency | Green and red callouts never adjacent within narrative acts. |

## 5. EXT-AXIS-F FINDINGS (Bespoke External Research)

### EXT-AXIS-F-001: F-Pattern as Freytag Scanner

**Description:** The F-pattern's three horizontal scans map to Freytag's first three acts. First scan (top, full-width) = exposition (reader is engaged, reads everything). Second scan (shorter) = rising action (reader becomes selective). Vertical descent = climax through denouement (reader scans headings only, looking for key terms). The F-degradation IS the CRESCENDO compression — the reader's attention narrows as density increases.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Reading physics observation. No CSS requirements that violate soul. Pure 2D scanning path mapped to narrative structure.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Act I content occupies full-width viewport (first F horizontal scan)
2. Act II content shorter horizontal extent, more left-aligned (second F scan)
3. Acts III-V headings prominent on left spine for vertical scanning (F descent)

---

### EXT-AXIS-F-002: Editorial Spread Pacing for F-Pattern Sections

**Description:** Magazine editorial design uses spread-level pacing: each spread (two facing pages) has its own internal rhythm before contributing to the larger arc. Applied to F-pattern: each Freytag act is a "spread" with its own sparse-intro → dense-body → sparse-bridge internal structure. This creates EXT-NARR-011 micro/macro pacing within the F-pattern axis.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Editorial design principle. Directly implements IS-7 (Unhurried Editor / magazine content). Uses whitespace (Rule 6) and typography hierarchy (Rule 4).

**Signature Elements:**
1. Each act opens with sparse lead paragraph (3-4 sentences, generous line-height)
2. Each act body densifies with code blocks, tables, detailed content
3. Each act closes with sparse bridge paragraph (1-2 sentences) transitioning to next act

---

### EXT-AXIS-F-003: Left-Spine Landmark Hierarchy

**Description:** The F-pattern vertical left descent relies on landmark differentiation — readers only scan headings on the left when they can distinguish between hierarchy levels instantly. This requires more than just size: combining font family (Instrument Serif for H2, Inter for H3), weight (bold vs regular), color (primary for H2, text for H3), and left-border (4px for H2, none for H3) creates a multi-signal landmark system.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Typography hierarchy (IS-2) using locked fonts and colors. Multi-signal differentiation uses SIZE, COLOR, POSITION (IS-1) without decoration. No shadows, rounded corners, or gradients.

**Signature Elements:**
1. H2: `font-family: 'Instrument Serif'; font-size: var(--type-section); border-left: 4px solid var(--color-primary)`
2. H3: `font-family: 'Inter'; font-size: var(--type-subsection); font-style: italic`
3. H4: `font-family: 'Inter'; font-size: var(--type-body); font-weight: 600; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.05em`

---

### EXT-AXIS-F-004: CRESCENDO Exhale via Freytag Falling Action

**Description:** Most CRESCENDO implementations omit the falling action — they build to climax and stop. EXT-NARR-001 identified this gap. The F-pattern provides a natural solution: after the vertical descent through climax density (Act III), the pattern REVERSES — the reader begins reading more horizontally again in Act IV (falling action) as density decreases. This creates a CRESCENDO with exhale: the F-pattern "opens up" again after the climax.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Structural pattern. The F-pattern reversal is a content strategy decision. No CSS soul implications.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Act IV content returns to wider horizontal extent (reader re-engages horizontally)
2. Act IV spacing increases (whitespace returns after climax compression)
3. Act V (denouement) matches Act I width and density — bookend structure

---

### EXT-AXIS-F-005: F-Pattern Code Block Placement Strategy

**Description:** In the F-pattern, code blocks should follow the attention degradation curve. Act I: zero code (OD-F-012). Act II: short inline code examples. Act III: full code blocks with annotations. Act IV: comparison code (before/after). Act V: reference summary code. The code density itself follows CRESCENDO within the F-pattern.

**Soul Test:** PASS — Content strategy. Code blocks use locked styles (JetBrains Mono, dark background per convention spec, sharp corners). No soul violations.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Act I: zero `<pre>` elements — prose only
2. Act III: `<pre>` blocks with `/* LESSON CHAIN */` comments + annotation callouts
3. Code block density per act: 0 → 1 → 3+ → 2 → 1 (CRESCENDO arc in code alone)

---

## 6. SIGNATURE ELEMENTS SUMMARY

| Finding | Signature Element 1 | Signature Element 2 | Signature Element 3 |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| EXT-AXIS-F-001 | Full-width Act I (first F scan) | Narrowing Act II (second F scan) | Left-spine headings Acts III-V (F descent) |
| EXT-AXIS-F-002 | Sparse lead paragraph per act | Dense body per act | Sparse bridge paragraph per act |
| EXT-AXIS-F-003 | H2 Instrument Serif + 4px left border | H3 Inter italic | H4 Inter uppercase small-caps |
| EXT-AXIS-F-004 | Act IV wider horizontal extent | Spacing increases post-climax | Act V matches Act I density (bookend) |
| EXT-AXIS-F-005 | Zero code in Act I | 3+ code blocks in Act III | Code density follows CRESCENDO arc |

---

## 7. SOUL FAIL FINDINGS (Reference Only — NOT for Application)

| Finding ID | Description | Why It Fails | Gate Violated |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| R4-181 | 3D Bento with CSS perspective | 3D transforms violate ANTI-PHYSICAL | G2, G5, G6, G7 |
| R4-185 | Hover shadow/lift effect on cards | Animated z-movement + false depth | G2, G5 |
| R4-186 | Progress indicators with rounded ends (pill bars) | border-radius: 9999px violates Soul #1/#5 | G1, G8 |
| R4-188 | Tab navigation with rounded tab shapes | Rounded tabs = physical affordance | G1 |
| R4-189 | Progressive disclosure with gradient reveal | Gradient = light/material interaction | G7 |
| R4-191 | Diagonal gradient color transitions | Gradient = light interaction | G7 |

**AD-002 Specific Risk:** The biggest soul risk for F-pattern/narrative is the tension meter. It MUST use square indicators (Soul Piece 5), not rounded progress bars (R4-186 SOUL FAIL). The tension meter fills via flat color (solid fill, no gradient), with sharp-edged markers. No pill shapes, no gradient fills.

---

## 8. RESEARCH DISCOVERIES / OPEN QUESTIONS FOR IDENTITY DELTA

### Discoveries to Investigate

1. **F-pattern reversal:** EXT-AXIS-F-004 proposes that the F-pattern "opens up" after climax. Does this actually happen in user reading behavior, or do readers simply leave after the climax? If readers leave, Act IV/V may be under-optimized.

2. **Tension meter as density self-documentation:** OD-005 proved that showing density enhances the page. The tension meter may serve the same purpose for narrative — making the CRESCENDO visible. Does exposing narrative structure enhance or spoil the reading experience?

3. **Freytag 5-beat vs 3-act:** OD-002 validated 5-beat (exposition, rising, climax, falling, denouement). Some R-4 findings reference 3-act (setup, confrontation, resolution). AD-002 should validate whether 5-beat or 3-act maps better to F-pattern scanning.

4. **Code absence boundary:** OD-F-012 says no code in Act I. At what point in Act II should code first appear? EXT-AXIS-F-005 proposes Act II, but the exact position within Act II needs testing.

### R-2/R-4 Synergy Pairings for AD-002

| Synergy | R-2 Source | R-4 Source | Axis Integration |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Axis Rhythm | R2-5.4 (dramatic type) | R4-039 (progressive rhythm) | Typography compression IS the CRESCENDO |
| Axis Geometry | R2-2.1 (F-pattern hierarchy) | R4-006 (F-pattern scanning) | Foundational F-axis definition |
| Axis Disclosure | R2-6.3 (scrollytelling) | R4-116 (scroll-based disclosure) | Scroll-driven CRESCENDO position indicator |
| Axis Density | R2-1.5 (whitespace as content) | R4-044 (musical rest) | Whitespace compression mirrors CRESCENDO |

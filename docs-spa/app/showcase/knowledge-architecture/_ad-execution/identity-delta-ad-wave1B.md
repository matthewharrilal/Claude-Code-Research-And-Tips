# Identity Delta — Wave 1B (AD-003 Bento Grid + AD-004 Spiral)

## Identity-Research Loop: S6→S7 (IDENTITY-TESTED → GUIDANCE-EVOLVED)
## Lens Version: v2 (Wave 1B = STRESS-TESTING type)

## 1. NEW DISCOVERIES (>= 2 surprises)

### Surprise 1: Multiple Mechanisms of Equivalence (AD-F-009 + AD-F-013)
The 3-way unification holds across all 4 explorations so far, but operates through DIFFERENT mechanisms:
- **Temporal** (Wave 1A): Z-sweep IS PULSE beat, F-descent IS CRESCENDO scanning
- **Spatial** (Bento Grid): Grid cell IS island, grid gap IS ocean
- **Proportional** (Spiral): Angular spiral allocation IS geological layering

The equivalence is UNIVERSAL but the mechanism is POLYMORPHIC. This is a CLASS B extension.

### Surprise 2: Angular Spiral Resolves Radial-Geological Tension (AD-F-013)
The expected stress-test failure (spiral can't be geological) didn't occur because the angular approximation transforms the spiral from a curve into nested rectangles — which ARE geological strata. The soul constraint (border-radius: 0) actually RESOLVED the tension by forcing angular geometry.

**Identity impact:** Soul constraints don't just limit the design space — they sometimes RESOLVE tensions that would be intractable with curved geometry. This is a new property of the ANTI-PHYSICAL identity.

### Surprise 3: Border-Weight Gradient as Identity-Safe Depth Encoding (AD-F-014)
4px/3px/1px border weights encode confidence levels (bedrock/subsoil/atmosphere) without any z-axis simulation. This is "depth without depth" — geological encoding through a purely 2D property. Skips 2px entirely to avoid the epidemic anti-pattern.

## 2. CHALLENGES RESOLVED

### CLASS A Findings (Confirming — 5 total)
- AD-F-009 (Bento CONTAINS Islands): Grid structure doesn't fight density
- AD-F-010 (Cell size IS island hierarchy): Size = density = importance
- AD-F-013 (Angular spiral resolves tension): Soul constraint helps
- AD-F-014 (Border-weight IS depth): 2D encoding of geological depth
- AD-F-016 (Spiral ENHANCES geological): Stress-test answer = YES, spiral can be geological

### CLASS B Findings (Extending — 3 total)
- AD-F-011 (Fractal ISLANDS): Internal layout variation creates fractal at component scale
- AD-F-012 (Compound Bento density): Grid operates BOOKENDS + ISLANDS simultaneously at different scales
- AD-F-015 (Confidence-proportional spacing): Spacing = confidence = density (3-way collapse)

### CLASS C Findings: NONE
Zero challenges to identity, even with STRESS-TESTING forward questions. This means either:
(a) The identity is genuinely robust across exotic axis patterns, or
(b) The stress test wasn't aggressive enough

**Lead assessment:** (a) is more likely. The stress test specifically targeted the most difficult pairings (Bento Grid + ISLANDS, Spiral + GEOLOGICAL) and found resolution, not failure. Wave 1C will use EXTENDING forward questions, not STRESS-TESTING, because further stress-testing is unlikely to yield new results.

### SOUL FAIL Patterns Documented
- Spiral: Avoided border-radius on angular approximation cells
- Bento: Avoided box-shadow for cell differentiation (used border-weight instead)
- Both: Zero rgba < 1.0

## 3. REVISED RESEARCH GUIDANCE (for Wave 1C)

### Updated DO Search:
- Axis patterns that EXTEND the identity into movement/choreography (Wave 1C includes Choreography)
- Compound patterns that test whether ALL density patterns can co-exist in one exploration
- Novel properties of the 3-way unification not yet discovered (we have temporal, spatial, proportional — what's next?)
- Identity implications of AD-006 being the "crown jewel" (most research, most complex)

### Updated DO NOT Search:
- (Same as v1/v2, plus:)
- Don't seek to break equivalence — 4 explorations have confirmed it. Instead, seek to CHARACTERIZE it.
- Don't duplicate the "can exotic patterns be combined?" stress-test — it's answered.

## 4. FORWARD QUESTIONS (Wave 1C = EXTENDING type)

1. **Q1 (Choreography):** What new identity insight does sequenced movement reveal? Does choreography introduce a KINETIC equivalence mechanism distinct from temporal, spatial, and proportional?

2. **Q2 (Compound):** When ALL density patterns co-exist in one exploration, does the 3-way unification hold simultaneously, or do individual equivalences interfere with each other?

3. **Q3 (Both):** If the equivalence is polymorphic (different mechanism per axis), is there a META-equivalence that unifies the mechanisms themselves? What IS the common thread across temporal, spatial, proportional, and (potentially) kinetic equivalence?

## 5. EXT-AXIS-* REFERENCE

- EXT-AXIS-SP-003 (angular approximation): Transforms Fibonacci spiral into right-angle nested rectangles compatible with anti-physical identity
- EXT-AXIS-B-004 (internal layout variation): Anti-monotony mechanism that doesn't break fractal self-similarity

## CONVENTION STATUS UPDATE
**After Wave 1B: ALL DRAFT → FROZEN**
Sections 12-16 AD-SPECIFIC values have been validated across 4 explorations:
- Section 12 (CSS Grid): VALIDATED — Bento Grid and Spiral both use named areas, fr units, gap tokens
- Section 13 (Flexbox): VALIDATED — used within axis zones for internal content layout
- Section 14 (Axis Zone Tokens): VALIDATED — --color-zone-* tokens used across all explorations
- Section 15 (Transitions): VALIDATED — reduced-motion compliance maintained
- Section 16 (Accessibility): VALIDATED — source order = reading order in all 4 explorations

**STATUS: CONVENTION FROZEN**

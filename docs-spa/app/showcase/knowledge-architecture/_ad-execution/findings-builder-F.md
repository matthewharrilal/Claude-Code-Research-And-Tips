## Findings

### AD-F-021: Triple Equivalence Holds at Compound Scale
**Class:** B (identity extension)
**Density:** ALL
**Mechanism:** Polymorphic (temporal + spatial + proportional + gravitational)
**Evidence:**

Changing axis pattern per section automatically changes density AND organization with zero manual density manipulation. Section 1 (Z-Pattern) creates PULSE through diagonal scanning. Section 2 (F-Pattern) creates CRESCENDO through progressive scanlines. Section 3 (Bento) creates ISLANDS through cell-size hierarchy. Section 4 (Spiral) creates GEOLOGICAL through ratio nesting. Section 5 (Choreography) creates WAVE through hub-spoke radiation.

The triple equivalence validated across AD-001-004 extends to compound: the compound page is NOT mixing five density patterns manually. Each section's density EMERGES from its axis choice. Organization = Density = Axis holds at compound scale exactly as it holds at individual pattern scale.

### AD-F-022: Fourth Equivalence Mechanism — Gravitational
**Class:** B (identity extension)
**Density:** WAVE
**Mechanism:** Gravitational (new, distinct from temporal/spatial/proportional)
**Evidence:**

Choreography (hub-spoke) creates density through CONNECTION COUNT, not content volume, reading time, cell size, or proportional ratio. The hub is dense because everything points to it. Spokes are sparse because they point to one thing. This is the fourth mechanism:

| Mechanism | Source | Creates Density Via |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| Temporal | Z, F | Reading time |
| Spatial | Bento | Cell size |
| Proportional | Spiral | Ratio nesting |
| **Gravitational** | **Choreography** | **Connection count** |

Gravitational density is relational: the hub's density comes from its connections, not its content. A hub with one sentence is denser than a spoke with three paragraphs because density here is topological (how many things point to you), not volumetric (how much content you contain).

### AD-F-023: Meta-Equivalence Identified — Attention Topology
**Class:** B (identity extension)
**Density:** FRACTAL
**Mechanism:** Meta (unifies all four mechanisms)
**Evidence:**

All four equivalence mechanisms (temporal, spatial, proportional, gravitational) are perspectives on one phenomenon: how content arrangement shapes attention flow. The meta-equivalence is ATTENTION TOPOLOGY.

- Axis geometry defines the topology (the shape of the attention map)
- Density is the experience of traversing that topology (how dense/sparse the journey feels)
- Organization is the semantic structure that the topology serves (why the content is arranged this way)

This answers the identity checkpoint's forward question #3 ("Is there a META-equivalence unifying temporal/spatial/proportional?"). Yes: attention topology. The axis IS the topology. The density IS the traversal. The organization IS the semantics. Three names for one map.

### AD-F-024: Compound Is Sequential, Not Simultaneous
**Class:** B (identity extension)
**Density:** CRESCENDO (page-scale)
**Mechanism:** Temporal (compound emerges through scrolling time)
**Evidence:**

The Development Kitchen experiments (Section 7) proved that attempting multiple axis patterns within a single viewport creates visual cacophony. Z + Spiral in one quadrant disorients (competing reading paths). Bento + Choreography conflicts (size hierarchy vs connection hierarchy). All five simultaneous is illegible.

The correct compound solution: each section commits to ONE axis pattern. The compound effect emerges from the SEQUENCE of sections, not from simultaneous application. This means compound axis is fundamentally a TEMPORAL experience — patterns layer through scrolling time, not viewport space.

This aligns with R4-081 (rhythm-based section flow: verse-chorus-bridge-verse). The compound page follows musical structure: overview (chorus) → pattern demos (verses) → synthesis (bridge) → meta-reflection (coda).

### AD-F-025: Transition Grammar Validated
**Class:** B (identity extension)
**Density:** Mode-transition breathing (OD-F-007)
**Mechanism:** Structural (pattern compatibility classification)
**Evidence:**

The 5x5 transition matrix (Section 3) classifies all 20 directed pattern transitions into three types:

- **Smooth** (4 pairs): Z↔F (both scanning-temporal), Bento↔Choreography (both structural)
- **Bridge** (10 pairs): Require a choreography section or transitional content as intermediary
- **Breathing** (6 pairs): All Spiral transitions plus any transition crossing mechanism boundaries (temporal→proportional, spatial→proportional)

Spiral is the most isolated pattern — every Spiral transition requires breathing (48px+ per OD-F-007). This makes sense: proportional density is the most cognitively distinct mechanism. Transitioning from "reading time" to "ratio nesting" requires a mental reset.

Choreography is the universal bridge — it can mediate any transition because gravitational density is compatible with all other mechanisms (connections can point to any content type).

### AD-F-026: Meta-Documentation IS the Purest Density Test
**Class:** B (identity extension — confirms OD-F-006)
**Density:** FRACTAL
**Mechanism:** Self-referential (content about patterns demonstrates patterns)
**Evidence:**

OD-F-006 stated: "Meta-documentation as purest density test." AD-006 confirms this empirically. A page that demonstrates its own patterns CANNOT fake density compliance. If the Z-Pattern section doesn't actually create PULSE rhythm, the reader experiences the failure directly. If the F-Pattern section doesn't create CRESCENDO, the progressive build breaks.

This is why AD-006 is the crown jewel: it is self-validating. The content IS the test. The structure IS the proof. No external verification is needed because the reader's experience of reading the page IS the verification of the page's claims.

This mirrors OD-006's role in the OD stage: OD-006 proved Organization IS Density by cycling through all 5 organizational modes. AD-006 proves Organization IS Density IS Axis by cycling through all 5 axis patterns.

### AD-F-027: DD-F-006 Fractal at 5 Scales — Compound Confirmed
**Class:** B (identity extension)
**Density:** FRACTAL
**Mechanism:** Self-similarity at 5 independent scales
**Evidence:**

DD-F-006 fractal compliance verified at all 5 scales in the compound context:

1. **Navigation scale:** Pattern echo grid (Section 1) — 6 cells, each containing CSS-only miniature of its axis pattern. 6th cell self-references (Hofstadterian strange loop). Axis indicator bar provides persistent navigation.

2. **Page scale:** Seven sections follow CRESCENDO — sparse overview (Section 1) builds through dense analysis (Sections 2-5) to climactic decision matrix (Section 6) and reflective meta (Section 7).

3. **Section scale:** Every section follows sparse-dense-sparse internally: header (sparse) → body grid/table (dense) → callout/reflection (sparse). Consistent across all 7 sections despite different axis patterns.

4. **Component scale:** Callout = sparse label (10px uppercase) + dense body (16px text). Table = sparse header (meta-sized) + dense rows (body-sized). Code = sparse comments + dense logic.

5. **Character scale:** Font signals density: Instrument Serif (sparse/editorial) vs Inter (dense/body) vs JetBrains Mono (dense/code). Even within text, heading words are sparse anchors and body sentences are dense content.

Each scale operates independently. The compound does not disrupt fractal self-similarity — it demonstrates that fractal compliance is axis-agnostic.

### AD-F-028: No Sixth Fractal Scale — 5-Scale Model Complete
**Class:** B (identity extension — bounds the model)
**Density:** FRACTAL
**Mechanism:** Negative finding (absence of new scale)
**Evidence:**

The identity checkpoint (forward question #3) asked whether AD-006 discovers a 6th fractal scale. After building the compound page, the answer is NO. The "strategy" scale (pattern selection → demonstration → synthesis) initially seemed like a candidate but collapsed into existing scales:

- Pattern selection = navigation scale (echo grid, axis indicator)
- Pattern demonstration = page scale (section sequence)
- Pattern synthesis = section scale (Section 7 meta-reflection)

The 5-scale model (navigation, page, section, component, character) is complete. Compound adds no new scale — instead, it demonstrates that all 5 scales can operate simultaneously across different axis patterns without interference. This IS the "sixth-scale" insight: the compound is not a new scale but proof that the 5-scale system is universal.

This bounds the DD-F-006 model: 5 scales, no more, no fewer. Future stages (CD) should not seek new scales but should verify existing scales hold under combination.

## 1. THE PROGRESSION: WHAT -> HOW -> WHERE -> ???

### Stage 2: DD = WHAT (Density) -- "What rhythms exist?"

DD explored the VOCABULARY of visual density. Six explorations tested six hypotheses about how information breathes on a page:

| Exploration | Pattern | Score | Discovery |
|-------------|---------|-------|-----------|
| DD-001 | PULSE | 33/40 | High-low-high alternating rhythm |
| DD-002 | CRESCENDO | 35/40 | Sparse-to-dense progressive build |
| DD-003 | ISLANDS | 32/40 | Dense clusters in sparse ocean |
| DD-004 | GEOLOGICAL | 35/40 | Stratification from atmosphere to bedrock |
| DD-005 | TIDAL/RIVERS | 36/40 | Width as inverse density |
| DD-006 | FRACTAL | 36/40 | Self-similar rhythm at all scales (meta-pattern) |

**Key output:** 6 density patterns, 18 DD-F findings, quality bar (34.5/40 avg), DD-F-006 fractal as meta-pattern.

**What DD established for the chain:** The density VOCABULARY that all subsequent stages operate within. DD didn't just find patterns -- it created the LANGUAGE for talking about how content breathes.

### Stage 3: OD = HOW (Organization) -- "How should information be structured?"

OD explored COGNITIVE rhythm -- not spacing but sequencing, grouping, and flow. The crown jewel discovery was that these aren't two layers:

| Exploration | Pattern | Score (v3) | Density Identity |
|-------------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| OD-001 | CONVERSATIONAL | 37/40 | Q&A IS PULSE |
| OD-002 | NARRATIVE | 35/40 | Story arc IS CRESCENDO |
| OD-003 | TASK-BASED | ~35/40 | Task clusters ARE ISLANDS |
| OD-004 | CONFIDENCE | 34/40 | Certainty strata IS GEOLOGICAL |
| OD-005 | SPATIAL | 35/40 | Hub-spoke IS WAVE |
| OD-006 | CREATIVE | 37/40 | All patterns unified -- crown jewel |

**Key output:** OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density" -- the 2-way unification. 17 OD-F findings.

**What OD elevated:** DD-F-010 ("org serves density") was ELEVATED to OD-F-005 ("org IS density"). This is the first identity statement: the patterns aren't layered, they're unified.

### Stage 4: AD = WHERE (Axis) -- "Where should content be positioned spatially?"

AD explored SPATIAL geometry -- how axis layouts express the org-density phenomenon. The crown jewel discovery completed the chain:

| Exploration | Pattern | Score | Equivalence Mechanism |
|-------------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| AD-001 | Z-PATTERN | 36/40 | Temporal (Z-sweep IS PULSE beat) |
| AD-002 | F-PATTERN | 35/40 | Temporal (F-descent IS CRESCENDO) |
| AD-003 | BENTO GRID | 37/40 | Spatial (grid cells ARE islands) |
| AD-004 | SPIRAL | 36/40 | Proportional (border-weight IS geological) |
| AD-005 | CHOREOGRAPHY | 35/40 | Kinetic (direction change IS density change) |
| AD-006 | COMPOUND | 38/40 | Gravitational (triple equivalence validated) |

**Key output:** AD-F-004/AD-F-023 "Axis IS Organization IS Density" -- the 3-way unification. 28 AD-F findings. Meta-equivalence: ATTENTION TOPOLOGY. 5 equivalence mechanisms. DD-F-006 bounded at exactly 5 fractal scales (AD-F-028).

**What AD elevated:** DD-F-012 ("density implies axis") ELEVATED to "axis IS density expressed spatially." The transitive chain (org -> density -> axis) is now VALIDATED as a single unified phenomenon.

### Stage 5: CD = COMBINATION -- "What happens when patterns combine?"

CD explores component CHEMISTRY -- how validated patterns from DD/OD/AD work TOGETHER. The question is NOT "what combinations exist" but rather:

**Does the 3-way equivalence (axis=org=density) HOLD under combination, or does combination reveal new dynamics?**

This makes CD fundamentally different from DD/OD/AD. Those stages each explored ONE dimension and discovered unification. CD explores MULTIPLE dimensions simultaneously and tests whether the unification is robust.

**The right framing for CD is: COMBINATION = STRESS TEST.**

---

## 2. HOW EACH STAGE ELEVATED PRIOR FINDINGS

The chain doesn't just accumulate -- it COMPOUNDS. Each stage takes the prior stage's findings and proves something stronger:

```
DD-F-010: "Organization should SERVE density"
    |
    | OD validated: org doesn't serve density, org IS density
    v
OD-F-005: "Organization IS Density" (2-way identity)
    |
    | AD validated: axis doesn't serve the identity, axis IS the identity
    v
AD-F-004: "Axis IS Organization IS Density" (3-way identity)
    |
    | AD discovered: all three are ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (AD-F-023)
    v
AD-F-023: Meta-equivalence -- ATTENTION TOPOLOGY
    |
    | CD must test: does this hold under combination?
    v
CD-F-???: Does combination preserve, extend, or break the identity?
```

**The elevation pattern:** Each stage starts with a CONSTRAINT ("this serves that") and discovers an IDENTITY ("this IS that"). DD discovered patterns. OD discovered they were the SAME patterns from a different perspective. AD discovered all three perspectives are one phenomenon (attention topology).

**What CD should discover:** Whether combination creates a FOURTH perspective or confirms that 3 is exhaustive. The handoff explicitly asks: "Does combination create a 6th fractal scale?" AD-F-028 says no -- 5 is the limit. CD must VALIDATE this bound.

---

## 3. DOES CD ESTABLISH A 4-WAY EQUIVALENCE OR TEST THE 3-WAY?

### The evidence strongly suggests: CD TESTS the 3-way, it does NOT create a 4th.

**Arguments for "CD tests the 3-way":**

1. **AD-F-023 (Attention Topology):** The meta-equivalence is already at the HIGHEST abstraction level. Attention topology encompasses density, organization, and axis. There is no obvious 4th dimension that combination would introduce -- combination is a MODE of the existing 3, not a new dimension.

2. **AD-F-028 (5-scale bound):** AD explicitly tested for a 6th fractal scale and found none. If combination created a new dimension, we'd expect a new scale. AD says the model is BOUNDED.

3. **AD-F-024 (compound is sequential):** AD-006 proved that compound density patterns work SEQUENTIALLY, not simultaneously. This means combination doesn't create parallel superposition of patterns -- it creates temporal/spatial sequences of existing patterns. This is RECOMBINATION, not new emergence.

4. **The handoff framing:** HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD explicitly frames CD's mission as "test whether COMBINATIONS of these validated patterns maintain the equivalence or reveal new dynamics at the combination scale." The word "maintain" is first, "reveal" is conditional.

**What CD should actually discover:**

- **Combination grammar:** How do transitions between combined patterns work? AD-F-025 validated transition grammar within a single compound page. CD must test whether this grammar scales to inter-page and inter-component combinations.
- **Density tolerance at combination scale:** DD-F-013 ("component density tolerance") is the GATE FINDING for CD. When two axis patterns combine, do their components maintain density tolerance or need splitting?
- **Attention topology composition:** How do attention topologies COMPOSE? If Z-Pattern has one topology and Bento Grid has another, what is the topology of Z+Bento?

---

## 4. ARE THE 6 PLANNED CD EXPLORATIONS STILL THE RIGHT SET?

### Current Plan (from STAGE-HEADER.md, written pre-OD):

| # | Name | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| CD-001 | Reasoning Inside Code | How reasoning content combines with code blocks |
| CD-002 | Task Containing Decision | How task structures contain decision-point content |
| CD-003 | File Tree with Callouts | How hierarchical navigation combines with annotation |
| CD-004 | Essence as Background | How wisdom/essence content serves as ambient context |
| CD-005 | All Callouts as Conversation | How callout components create conversational flow |
| CD-006 | Creative | Crown jewel -- compound combination |

### Assessment: PARTIALLY WRONG. Needs revision.

**Problem 1: These are CONTENT combinations, not PATTERN combinations.**

DD/OD/AD explored abstract PATTERNS (PULSE, CONVERSATIONAL, Z-PATTERN). CD's planned explorations describe CONTENT SCENARIOS (code + reasoning, tasks + decisions). This is a category error. CD should explore how PATTERNS combine (Z-Pattern + Bento Grid, CONVERSATIONAL + CRESCENDO), not how CONTENT TYPES coexist.

**However:** There is an argument that CD is SUPPOSED to be more concrete. DD->OD->AD ascended in abstraction. CD descends back toward reality -- testing how the abstract patterns manifest in real content combinations. The 6 explorations represent real documentation scenarios that would exist in the migrated KortAI site.

**Problem 2: Missing explicit pattern-combination mappings.**

Each CD exploration should map to specific pattern combinations, the way OD mapped to DD density patterns and AD mapped to OD org patterns:

| CD Exploration | DD Pattern | OD Pattern | AD Pattern | Combination Being Tested |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------------------|
| CD-001 | CRESCENDO | TASK-BASED + NARRATIVE | F-PATTERN + BENTO | Code reasoning builds; tasks contain code; F-Pattern reveals reasoning through code |
| CD-002 | PULSE + CRESCENDO | CONVERSATIONAL + CONFIDENCE | Z-PATTERN + SPIRAL | Decision points pulse; confidence strata spiral through task flow |
| CD-003 | ISLANDS + GEOLOGICAL | SPATIAL + TASK-BASED | BENTO + CHOREOGRAPHY | File tree is spatial; callouts are islands within choreographed navigation |
| CD-004 | TIDAL | NARRATIVE + CREATIVE | F-PATTERN + COMPOUND | Essence flows as tidal background; narrative creates F-pattern descent |
| CD-005 | PULSE | CONVERSATIONAL | Z-PATTERN | Callout-as-conversation is pure PULSE+Z; tests if conversation can be sole organizational mode |
| CD-006 | ALL (FRACTAL) | ALL | ALL (COMPOUND) | Crown jewel: all patterns combined, fractal self-similarity under maximum combination stress |

**Problem 3: CD-005 may be redundant with OD-001.**

OD-001 (Conversational, 37/40) already explored Q&A as PULSE. CD-005 (All Callouts as Conversation) is essentially testing whether OD-001's conversational pattern works when ONLY callout components are used. This is closer to a component test than a combination test.

**Recommendation:** Replace CD-005 with something that tests a HARDER combination case. For example:
- **CD-005 (revised): Multi-Axis Transition** -- A single page that transitions through 3+ axis patterns (Z -> F -> Bento) with documented transition grammar. Tests AD-F-025 transition grammar at maximum scale.

**Problem 4: CD-004 is vague.**

"Essence as Background" doesn't clearly map to a pattern combination. What does "background" mean in a 2D flat anti-physical identity? The soul pieces reject depth. Background implies z-layering. This needs reframing.

**Recommendation:** Reframe CD-004 as:
- **CD-004 (revised): Ambient Context Layer** -- How wisdom/essence content persists as a TIDAL thread through dense task content. Tests whether TIDAL pattern can operate as a continuous substrate under ISLANDS task clusters.

### Revised CD Exploration Set:

| # | Revised Name | Pattern Combination | Gate Question |
|---|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| CD-001 | Reasoning Inside Code | F-PATTERN + BENTO + CRESCENDO | Does reasoning density build within code container boundaries? |
| CD-002 | Task Containing Decision | Z-PATTERN + SPIRAL + PULSE | Can decision-point density pulse within task container confidence strata? |
| CD-003 | File Tree with Callouts | BENTO + CHOREOGRAPHY + ISLANDS | Does hierarchical navigation choreography preserve island independence? |
| CD-004 | Ambient Context Layer | TIDAL + ISLANDS + GEOLOGICAL | Can essence flow as continuous tidal substrate under dense task islands? |
| CD-005 | Multi-Axis Transition | Z + F + BENTO + transition grammar | Does AD-F-025 transition grammar hold across 3+ axis patterns on one page? |
| CD-006 | Creative (Crown Jewel) | ALL patterns combined | Does the 3-way equivalence hold at maximum combination stress? |

## 5. TEAM TOPOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CD

### What Worked in AD (from MASTER-AD-EXECUTION-SPEC.md and _ad-execution/ evidence)

AD used ~25 agents across 5 phases with flat-per-phase topology:
- Phase 0: Convention + Research (~6 agents, ~45 min)
- Phase 1: 3-wave build (2 builders + scribe per wave, ~2-3 hours)
- Phase 2: Multi-dimensional audit (~7 agents, ~45 min)
- Phase 3: Fix execution (per-file fixers, ~25 min)
- Phase 4: Synthesis + handoff (~3 agents, ~30 min)

The _ad-execution/ directory contains 60 files showing this topology executed successfully.

### CD Topology Recommendation: SAME structure, SMALLER team

**Rationale:** CD is the TERMINAL stage. Its explorations should be MORE constrained (combinations of already-validated patterns, not novel pattern discovery). This means:

1. **Fewer builders needed:** CD builders implement KNOWN patterns in combination, not discover new ones. 2 per wave is still right, but the build should be faster.

2. **Convention is INHERITED, not created:** CD inherits AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (822 lines, sections 1-16). It adds sections 17-20 only. The Convention Agent role shrinks to a Convention Extender.

3. **Research is FOCUSED:** R-5 (39 findings) is 5x smaller than R-4 (192 findings). Evaluation is lighter. EXT-CD-* bespoke research is still warranted but at lower volume.

4. **Audit can be lighter:** CD's patterns are combinations of ALREADY-AUDITED individual patterns. The audit should focus on:
   - Combination-specific failures (transition grammar violations, density tolerance breaks)
   - Soul compliance (always full)
   - Combination coherence (new for CD)

### Recommended CD Team (~18-20 agents):

| Phase | Agents | Duration |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 0: Convention Extension + R-5 Evaluation | 4 (Convention Extender, R-5 Evaluator, Research Packager, Convention Auditor) | ~30 min |
| Phase 1A: CD-001 + CD-002 | 3 (2 builders + scribe) | ~45 min |
| Phase 1B: CD-003 + CD-004 | 3 (2 builders + scribe) | ~45 min |
| Phase 1C: CD-005 + CD-006 | 3 (2 builders + scribe) | ~60 min (CD-006 gets extra time) |
| Phase 2: Audit | 5 (visual, structural, fresh-eyes, provenance, synthesizer) | ~45 min |
| Phase 3: Fix | 2-4 (per-file fixers) | ~25 min |
| Phase 4: Synthesis + Handoff | 3 (synthesizer, identity scribe, infrastructure updater) | ~30 min |
| Weaver (persistent) | 1 | Full session |

**Total: ~18-20 agents, ~4-5 hours wall time (vs AD's ~5-6 hours)**

---

## 6. DOES CD NEED ITS OWN CONVENTION SPEC, EXT-CD-* RESEARCH, RESEARCH GATE?

### Convention Spec: YES, but as EXTENSION, not standalone

CD inherits AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md sections 1-16. It adds:
- Section 17: Combination Rules (how pattern combinations are structured in HTML/CSS)
- Section 18: Transition Grammar Extension (AD-F-025 extended for multi-pattern pages)
- Section 19: Component Density Tolerance Table (DD-F-013 operationalized per component pair)
- Section 20: Combination Accessibility Requirements (WCAG for multi-pattern pages)

**Format:** CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md, standalone (all values present), ~600-800 lines.

### EXT-CD-* Research: YES, but lower volume

The HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md explicitly recommends commissioning EXT-CD-* research for:
- Combination layout patterns
- Multi-axis co-existence strategies
- Transition grammar extensions
- Component density tolerance testing

OD's EXT-* rate was 95.8% consumption vs R-1's 78.6%. AD followed suit with EXT-AXIS-*. CD should continue the pattern but with ~15-20 findings (vs OD's 94 and AD's 33), given R-5 is already combination-focused.

### Research Gate: YES

AD-RESEARCH-GATE.md is a proven structure. CD needs:
- R-5 evaluation (39 findings, PRIMARY)
- R-4 secondary mapping (which axis findings apply to combinations)
- R-2 tertiary review (which creative layout findings apply to combined layouts)
- EXT-CD-* registration

---

## 7. CD IS TERMINAL -- SUCCESSOR IS MIGRATION

### What "terminal" means:

1. **No HANDOFF-CD-TO-*.md:** CD doesn't hand off to another exploration stage. It produces CD-F-### findings and combination rules that feed DIRECTLY into Migration.

2. **ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 is the FINAL identity:** v1.1 was input to AD, v2 was output. v2 is input to CD, v3 will be the COMPLETE accumulated identity for Migration.

3. **Combination rules are the LAST pattern vocabulary:** After CD, the system has density patterns, organizational patterns, axis patterns, AND combination rules. No new pattern categories will be created.

4. **Migration consumes EVERYTHING:** The Migration phase reads the entire provenance chain (all stages' findings, all patterns, all soul pieces, the complete accumulated identity) and applies it to real KortAI documentation pages.

### What CD must produce for Migration:

| Output | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| CD-F-### findings (10-20) | Combination-specific discoveries |
| combination-rules.md | Validated combination patterns with constraints |
| CD-SYNTHESIS.md | Cross-CD analysis |
| ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3.md | Final identity document |
| Updated BACKBONE.md | Stage 5 section complete |
| Updated PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md | CD findings registered |
| Updated PATTERN-INDEX.md | Combination patterns added |

### What CD does NOT need to produce:

- No HANDOFF-CD-TO-MIGRATION.md -- Migration reads the entire provenance chain, not a handoff
  - **Actually, reconsider:** A brief "MIGRATION-READY.md" document listing what the complete system looks like AFTER CD would be valuable. Not a handoff (there's no next exploration stage) but a COMPLETION CERTIFICATE that confirms the full pattern vocabulary is validated.

---

## 8. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW CD SHOULD DIFFER FROM ORIGINAL PLAN

### 8.1 Reframe from "Component Chemistry" to "Pattern Combination Stress Test"

The current framing (STAGE-HEADER.md, CLAUDE.md) describes CD as "component chemistry -- how components WORK TOGETHER." This is too close to a component library integration test. The 3-way unification discovery (AD-F-004/AD-F-023) changes what CD needs to test.

**New framing:** CD tests whether the ATTENTION TOPOLOGY meta-equivalence (AD-F-023) is robust under COMBINATION. Each CD exploration combines 2-3 validated patterns and asks: "Does the equivalence hold, extend, or break?"

### 8.2 Add explicit pattern-combination mapping to each CD exploration

Every CD exploration MUST declare:
- Which DD density pattern(s) it combines
- Which OD organizational pattern(s) it combines
- Which AD axis pattern(s) it combines
- What specific combination dynamic it tests

This was missing from the original plan. Without it, CD builders will treat explorations as content design exercises rather than pattern combination experiments.

### 8.3 Operationalize DD-F-013 (density tolerance) as CD's primary gate

DD-F-013 ("component density tolerance -- how much density variation can a single component absorb before it needs to split into multiple components") is explicitly designated as CD's gate finding in HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md.

CD needs a DENSITY TOLERANCE TABLE created in Phase 0:

| Component | High Density Tolerance | Low Density Tolerance | Combination Constraint |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Code block | HIGH (compresses well) | -- | Can be packed into dense zones |
| Essence callout | -- | HIGH (needs breathing room) | Must NOT be in dense zones |
| Q&A pair | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Width determines density |
| Task cluster | HIGH (collapses via details) | -- | Interactive mode relieves density |
| File tree | MEDIUM | -- | Depth determines density |

### 8.4 Answer the 5 open questions from HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md

The handoff explicitly lists 5 unanswered questions:

1. **Combination density tolerance** -- operationalize via density tolerance table
2. **Transition grammar scaling** -- test with CD-005 (multi-axis transition)
3. **Attention topology composition** -- synthesize in CD-006 crown jewel
4. **Sequential vs parallel combinations** -- AD-F-024 says sequential; CD tests if parallel exists
5. **Fractal at combination scale** -- AD-F-028 says 5 scales; CD validates the bound

Each CD exploration should be assigned 1-2 of these questions as its primary research target.

### 8.5 CD-006 is the TERMINAL crown jewel

Not just the CD crown jewel -- the PIPELINE crown jewel. CD-006 should be the most ambitious exploration in the entire 5-stage pipeline. It should demonstrate:
- All 6 density patterns active
- All 6 organizational patterns active (or referenced)
- All 6 axis patterns active (or a compound subset)
- The 3-way equivalence holding under maximum combination stress
- Fractal self-similarity at 5 scales under combination
- Transition grammar working across all pattern boundaries

CD-006 gets 30-40% of the research budget (same as AD-006). It should be planned from Phase 0.

### 8.6 Lighter audit, heavier synthesis

CD's patterns are combinations of already-audited individual patterns. The audit phase can be lighter (soul compliance + combination coherence, not full adversarial multi-dimensional). But the SYNTHESIS phase should be heavier -- CD-SYNTHESIS.md should be the most comprehensive synthesis in the pipeline, because it closes the chain.

### 8.7 Consider 2-wave build instead of 3-wave

AD needed 3 waves because axis patterns are inherently complex (CSS-heavy, requiring responsive breakpoints). CD's patterns are COMBINATIONS of already-built patterns. Each CD exploration is more about COMPOSITION than creation. Two waves may suffice:
- Wave 1: CD-001/002/003 (simpler combinations)
- Wave 2: CD-004/005/006 (complex combinations + crown jewel)

This saves ~1 hour wall time and reduces total agent count by ~3.

### 8.8 Produce MIGRATION-READY.md as final output

Instead of (or in addition to) a traditional handoff, CD should produce a MIGRATION-READY.md document that:
- Confirms the complete pattern vocabulary
- Lists all CD-F findings
- Confirms whether the 3-way equivalence held under combination
- Provides a PATTERN SELECTION GUIDE for migration: "given content type X, use combination Y"
- States what ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 contains vs v2

---

## 9. SUMMARY: CD'S MISSION IN ONE PARAGRAPH

CD is the terminal exploration stage. It receives the validated 3-way equivalence (axis IS organization IS density = ATTENTION TOPOLOGY) and tests whether this equivalence is robust under COMBINATION. Six explorations combine 2-3 patterns each, with CD-006 as the pipeline crown jewel testing maximum combination stress. CD's gate finding is DD-F-013 (density tolerance), and its primary research is R-5 (Combination Theory, 39 findings). CD produces CD-F-### findings, combination rules, ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3, and a MIGRATION-READY.md completion certificate. After CD, the pattern vocabulary is complete, the provenance chain is closed, and Migration can begin.

## 10. CROSS-REFERENCE: Stage Score Progression

| Stage | Avg Score | Range | Crown Jewel | Finding Count |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| DD | 34.5/40 | 32-36 | DD-006 Fractal (36) | 18 DD-F |
| OD (v3) | ~35.5/40 | 34-37 | OD-006 Creative (37) | 17 OD-F |
| AD | 36.2/40 | 35-38 | AD-006 Compound (38) | 28 AD-F |
| CD (target) | >=34/40 | >=32 for INCLUDE | CD-006 Pipeline Crown Jewel | 10-20 CD-F |

The score progression shows ~+1.0/stage average improvement. Each crown jewel scores progressively higher (36->37->38). CD-006 should target 39-40/40.

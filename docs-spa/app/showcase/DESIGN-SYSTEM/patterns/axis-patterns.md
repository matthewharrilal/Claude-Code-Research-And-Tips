# Axis Patterns
## Spatial Layout for Documentation

## PROVENANCE NOTICE

These patterns are NOT arbitrary. Each was validated through AD explorations
with visual audit, adversarial review, convention spec enforcement (pre-build),
and 3-wave builder execution. See `provenance/stage-4-axis-ad/` for the full
chain. The crown jewel discovery from this stage: **Axis IS Organization IS
Density** (AD-F-004, AD-F-023) -- axis geometry does not merely "serve" the
density pattern; axis IS the density pattern expressed spatially. Three names
for one phenomenon: how content arrangement shapes attention flow.

DD-F-012 is ELEVATED: the relationship between axis and density is identity
(equivalence), not servitude (subordination).

| Pattern | Exploration | Density Pairing | Org Pairing | Finding IDs | EXT-AXIS-* Applied |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Z-PATTERN | AD-001 | PULSE + TIDAL | Conversational | AD-F-001, AD-F-002, AD-F-003, AD-F-004 | 5 EXT-AXIS-Z |
| F-PATTERN | AD-002 | CRESCENDO | Narrative Arc | AD-F-005, AD-F-006, AD-F-007, AD-F-008 | 5 EXT-AXIS-F |
| BENTO GRID | AD-003 | ISLANDS + BOOKENDS | Task-Based | AD-F-009, AD-F-010, AD-F-011, AD-F-012 | 5 EXT-AXIS-B |
| SPIRAL | AD-004 | GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO | Confidence-Based | AD-F-013, AD-F-014, AD-F-015, AD-F-016 | 5 EXT-AXIS-SP |
| CHOREOGRAPHY | AD-005 | WAVE + ISLANDS | Spatial | AD-F-017, AD-F-018, AD-F-019, AD-F-020 | 5 EXT-AXIS-CH |

## The 6 Axis Patterns

### Z-PATTERN -- Gutenberg Diagonal Traversal
```
[Primary Optical]  ────→  [Strong Fallow]
         ╲
          ╲ (diagonal sweep)
           ╲
[Weak Fallow]  ────→  [Terminal Area]
```

**Status:** VALIDATED

**When to Use:** Content that naturally takes a question-and-answer form,
hero/landing sections, or any content where eye-tracking follows the
Gutenberg Z-path. Q&A alternation creates Z-sweep cycles; each cycle IS
one PULSE beat. The Z-pattern does not need to be "paired with" PULSE --
it IS PULSE expressed spatially.

**Research Provenance:**
- R4-055 (establishing shots) -- hero must precede content
- R4-083 (hero Z-pattern) -- Gutenberg diagram quadrant mapping
- R4-038 (PULSE = Z-cycle) -- scanning rhythm equivalence
- EXT-AXIS-Z-001 (golden ratio hero proportions)
- EXT-AXIS-Z-002 (typography velocity = Z-position)
- EXT-AXIS-Z-004 (Z-diagonal = conversational turn)
- EXT-AXIS-Z-005 (micro-Z grid at component scale)
- DD-F-001 (PULSE) -- high-low alternation
- DD-F-005 (TIDAL) -- width variation
- OD-F-001 (Conversational width variation)
- OD-F-003 (Q&A as natural PULSE generator)

**Validated By:** AD-001

**Equivalence Mechanism:** TEMPORAL -- Z-sweep creates density through scanning
speed / reading time. Fast horizontal scans (question = sparse) alternate with
slower deep reads (answer = dense).

**Density Pairing:** PULSE (primary) + TIDAL (secondary)
- Questions = sparse (narrow width 60%, heavy serif type, typographic breathing)
- Answers = dense (full width 100%, light sans type, code blocks, detail)
- Width variation (Q at 60%, A at 100%) creates TIDAL secondary rhythm
- Z-diagonal IS the PULSE transition point

**Soul Pieces Verified:** 5/5
- Sharp Edges: border-radius: 0 in :root
- No Shadows: box-shadow: none; solid offset for depth
- Serif = Wisdom: Instrument Serif for questions, titles, essence callouts
- Callout Family DNA: 2-zone (label+body), 4px left border
- Squares Signal System: 8x8px question markers, no radius

**Key Insight (AD-F-002):** Z-pattern traversal and PULSE rhythm are the SAME
phenomenon viewed from different perspectives. Each Z-sweep cycle IS one PULSE
beat. Width variation IS TIDAL. Z-pattern axis geometry does not need to be
"paired with" PULSE -- it IS PULSE expressed spatially.

**3-Way Unification (AD-F-004):** Four structural proofs: (1) Z-diagonal =
conversational turn. (2) Width variation = TIDAL = Z-asymmetry. (3) PULSE =
Z-cycle. (4) Typography velocity = Z-position = PULSE tempo.

**Cross-Stage References:**
- OD-001 Conversational (organizational pairing)
- DD-001 PULSE + DD-005 TIDAL (density pairings)
- DD-F-006 Fractal validated at component scale via micro-Z grid (AD-F-003)

### F-PATTERN -- Vertical Descent with Horizontal Scans
```
═════════════════════  (first scan: full horizontal)
═══════════════        (second scan: shorter horizontal)
═══════                (third scan: degraded to vertical)
═══                    (vertical descent: left-spine only)
```

**Status:** VALIDATED

**When to Use:** Content with progressive complexity, narrative arcs, and
text-heavy reference material. F-pattern vertical descent creates progressive
reading degradation -- readers scan less horizontally as content density
increases. This IS CRESCENDO: typography compression across acts mirrors
CRESCENDO density.

**Research Provenance:**
- R4-039 (progressive compression) -- act-zone padding decreases
- R4-048 (typography hierarchy) -- heading compression across acts
- R4-051 (decision matrix) -- densest single component
- R4-098 (climax component) -- where all three dimensions converge
- R2-5.1, R2-5.4 (typography velocity)
- EXT-AXIS-F-001 through EXT-AXIS-F-005 (F-pattern research)
- EXT-AXIS-F-003 (left-spine heading hierarchy)
- DD-F-002 (CRESCENDO) -- sparse-to-dense progressive build
- OD-F-009 (Narrative arc)
- OD-F-011 (Tension meter)
- OD-F-013 (Decision matrix density)

**Validated By:** AD-002

**Equivalence Mechanism:** TEMPORAL -- F-pattern descent creates density through
progressive compression. Reading time per section decreases as content density
increases, mirroring CRESCENDO's sparse-to-dense gradient.

**Density Pairing:** CRESCENDO (primary)
- Act I (Exposition): sparse -- 64px act-zone padding, generous whitespace
- Act II (Rising Action): moderate -- 48px padding, increasing code
- Act III (Climax): dense -- 32px padding, decision matrix IS CRESCENDO peak
- Act IV (Falling Action): moderate -- implications, trade-offs
- Act V (Resolution): sparse exhale -- summary, what was learned

**Typography Compression (AD-F-006):** Act-zone padding compresses across acts
(64px in Act I to 32px in Act III). Compression at act boundary level (inter-heading),
not within headings (intra-heading margin remains constant at 24px).

**Left-Spine Landmarks (AD-F-007):** During F-pattern vertical descent, only
left-aligned headings with border-left accents are visible. Left-spine hierarchy:
H2 = Instrument Serif + 4px red left border, H3 = Instrument Serif italic (no
border), H4 = Inter uppercase with letter-spacing 0.05em. Redundant signals ensure
scanning at speed catches landmarks.

**Decision Matrix (AD-F-008):** The decision matrix at Act III is the densest
single component (6 rows x 4 columns = 24 data cells). It deliberately arrests
F-pattern vertical descent, forcing horizontal re-engagement. All three dimensions
converge: F-pattern interrupted (axis), narrative climax (organization), densest
component (CRESCENDO peak).

**Soul Pieces Verified:** 5/5
- Sharp Edges: border-radius: 0 in :root
- No Shadows: box-shadow: none in :root
- Serif = Wisdom: Instrument Serif for act titles, narrative transitions, essence
- Callout Family DNA: 2-zone callouts, 4px left border, color-only differentiation
- Squares Signal System: square act markers, no radius

**Key Insight (AD-F-005):** Tension meter tracks CRESCENDO density position
(which Freytag act the reader occupies), not just narrative position. Tension
fills fully by Act IV (not Act V) because narrative tension resolves during
falling action. Tension leads density.

**Cross-Stage References:**
- OD-002 Narrative Arc (organizational pairing)
- DD-002 CRESCENDO (density pairing)
- OD-F-011 Tension meter (inherited, recontextualized for F-pattern)

### BENTO GRID -- Discrete Cell Container
```
┌────────────┬──────┐
│  2x2 cell  │ 1x1  │
│  (primary) │(sec.)│
├──────┬─────┴──────┤
│ 1x1  │   2x1 cell │
│(tert)│  (detail)   │
└──────┴────────────┘
```

**Status:** VALIDATED

**When to Use:** Procedural documentation with discrete self-contained tasks,
component catalogs, and any content organized around independent units. Grid
cells ARE dense islands; grid gaps ARE sparse ocean. The bento grid does not
fight the ISLANDS density pattern -- it provides the structural container that
gives ISLANDS their definition.

**Research Provenance:**
- R4-026 (varied sizes create hierarchy)
- R4-036 (grid as containment system)
- R4-037 (cell size = importance)
- EXT-AXIS-B-001 through EXT-AXIS-B-005 (bento grid research)
- EXT-AXIS-B-004 (4 internal layout templates: A/B/C/D)
- DD-F-003 (ISLANDS) -- dense clusters in sparse ocean
- DD-F-006 (FRACTAL) -- self-similarity at 4 scales
- OD-F-010 (Task-Based discrete clusters)
- EXT-TASK-013 (structural monotony deficit addressed)

**Validated By:** AD-003

**Equivalence Mechanism:** SPATIAL -- grid cells ARE density. Large cells =
dense islands; gaps = sparse ocean. Size IS density IS importance -- three
properties that are one phenomenon.

**Density Pairing:** ISLANDS (primary) + BOOKENDS (secondary)
- Task overview (front BOOKEND): dense orientation header
- Bento cells: dense self-contained task clusters
- Grid gaps: sparse ocean (24px gap IS "empty space between dense content")
- Footer (back BOOKEND): dense summary and checkpoint

**Cell Size Hierarchy (AD-F-010):** A 2x2 cell occupying 4x the area of a 1x1
cell creates a proportionally larger island. Size = density = importance. Soul
constraint (sharp edges) makes size difference MORE visible -- crisp boundaries.
Anti-pattern contrast: Apple's bento uses rounded corners + shadows; KortAI's
bento uses sharp edges + size differentiation only.

**Internal Layout Variation (AD-F-011):** Each bento cell can use a DIFFERENT
internal layout template (vertical steps, code-split, annotated, comparison)
while maintaining consistent external grid structure. This is an anti-monotony
mechanism that does NOT break the fractal -- like different "species" on
different islands.

**Compound Density (AD-F-012):** Bento grid enables COMPOUND density by
operating BOOKENDS and ISLANDS simultaneously at different scales. Grid source
order guarantees BOOKENDS start/end; cell+gap structure guarantees ISLANDS.
One structural phenomenon serving both patterns at once.

**ISLANDS at 4 Fractal Scales:**
- Page: `margin-bottom: 80px` (section gaps)
- Section: `gap: 24px` (grid gaps)
- Component: `padding: 24px` (cell internal padding)
- Character: `line-height: 1.5` (text density)

**Soul Pieces Verified:** 5/5
- Sharp Edges: border-radius: 0 in :root
- No Shadows: box-shadow: none; solid offset for depth
- Serif = Wisdom: Instrument Serif for titles, task headers, essence callouts
- Callout Family DNA: 2-zone (label+body), 4px left border
- Squares Signal System: square step markers, task numbers, checklist boxes

**Key Insight (AD-F-009):** Grid cells ARE dense islands; grid gaps ARE sparse
ocean. The rigidity prevents the "visual chaos" failure mode where islands
drift into irregular arrangements. Bento CONTAINS the ISLANDS pattern.

**Cross-Stage References:**
- OD-003 Task-Based (organizational pairing)
- DD-003 ISLANDS + DD-001 BOOKENDS (density pairings)
- OD-003 compound density finding (extended by AD-F-012)

### SPIRAL -- Angular Golden-Ratio Nesting
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│  OUTER RING (sparse)     │
│  ┌───────────────────┐   │
│  │ MIDDLE (moderate)  │   │
│  │  ┌────────────┐   │   │
│  │  │ CORE       │   │   │
│  │  │ (dense)    │   │   │
│  │  └────────────┘   │   │
│  └───────────────────┘   │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**Status:** VALIDATED

**When to Use:** Content where certainty varies across sections, hierarchical
depth content, and any material structured around confidence levels or
progressive depth. The angular approximation (forced by `border-radius: 0`)
transforms the spiral into nested rectangles -- which ARE geological strata.

**Research Provenance:**
- R4-059 (golden ratio proportions)
- R4-062 (focal point / core)
- R4-073 (spiral reading order)
- R4-036 (proportional nesting)
- R4-042, R4-045 (border-weight gradient)
- R2-1.5, R2-2.3, R2-6.3 (proportional layout)
- EXT-AXIS-SP-001 through EXT-AXIS-SP-005 (spiral layout research)
- EXT-AXIS-SP-002 (border-weight as geological signal)
- EXT-AXIS-SP-003 (angular approximation)
- EXT-AXIS-SP-004 (confidence-proportional spacing)
- DD-F-004 (GEOLOGICAL) -- 5-layer depth stratification
- DD-F-002 (CRESCENDO) -- progressive density increase
- OD-F-011 (Confidence-Based) -- certainty stratification

**Validated By:** AD-004

**Equivalence Mechanism:** PROPORTIONAL -- golden ratio nesting creates density
through proportional area allocation. Inner rings = denser, outer rings =
sparser. Proportional allocation IS geological stratification IS confidence
encoding.

**Density Pairing:** GEOLOGICAL (primary) + CRESCENDO (secondary)
- Outer ring (Atmosphere/Open): sparsest -- padding 48px, gap 64px, 1px border
- Middle ring (Probable/Speculative): moderate -- padding 32-40px, 3px border
- Core ring (Established/Bedrock): densest -- padding 24px, 4px border
- Dual traversability: inward = CRESCENDO; outward = inverse CRESCENDO

**Angular Resolution (AD-F-013):** A mathematical Fibonacci spiral conflicts with
GEOLOGICAL density's horizontal stratification. The angular approximation
transforms the spiral into nested rectangles with right-angle boundaries --
which ARE geological strata. The soul constraint (`border-radius: 0`) forces
this angular approximation, which resolves the tension. The constraint is
generative, not restrictive.

**Border-Weight Gradient (AD-F-014):** 4px/3px/1px left-border gradient encodes
geological depth as a flat 2D property. 4px = bedrock (heaviest, most certain),
3px = subsoil (strong), 1px = atmosphere (lightest, most speculative). Skips
2px entirely to avoid 2px epidemic anti-pattern (OD-F-AP-001). This is the ONE
context where progressive border widths are semantic, not epidemic.

**Confidence-Proportional Spacing (AD-F-015):** Spacing within each stratum
correlates with confidence level: Established = 24px (tight), Probable = 32px,
Speculative = 40px, Open = 48px padding / 64px gap. Each follows the spacing
token scale. Spacing IS the confidence signal.

**Soul Pieces Verified:** 5/5
- Sharp Edges: border-radius: 0 in :root -- THE mechanism for angular spiral
- No Shadows: box-shadow: none; solid offset for depth
- Serif = Wisdom: Instrument Serif for stratum headers, essence callouts
- Callout Family DNA: 2-zone (label+body), 4px left border
- Squares Signal System: square progress markers, confidence indicators

**Key Insight (AD-F-016):** A spiral CAN be geological. The angular spiral
preserves geological sequence, allocates proportional space via golden ratio,
and adds a second dimension within each stratum (golden-ratio two-column grid).
Soul constraint forces angular approximation which IS geological stratification.
This was the AD stage's strongest evidence that soul constraints are generative.

- DD-004 GEOLOGICAL + DD-002 CRESCENDO (density pairings)

### CHOREOGRAPHY -- Hub-Spoke Attention Direction
```
        ┌─── Spoke A (dense) ──┐
        │                       │
HUB (sparse) ── Spoke B (dense) ── HUB (return)
        │                       │
        └─── Spoke C (dense) ──┘
```

**Status:** VALIDATED

**When to Use:** Content organized as territories or zones that users navigate
between, hub-and-spoke architectures, feature catalogs, and any documentation
with a central overview and explorable subtopics. "Choreography" means
choreography of the READER's attention through static content structure, not
CSS animation (AD-F-020).

**Research Provenance:**
- R4-126, R4-127, R4-131 (compositional accents, rectangular monotony breaking)
- R4-033 (hub-spoke topology)
- R4-038, R4-042, R4-044 (transition classification)
- R2-5.1 (visual rhythm)
- EXT-AXIS-CH-001 through EXT-AXIS-CH-005 (choreography research)
- EXT-AXIS-CH-003 (diagonal as density transition marker)
- DD-F-009 (WAVE) -- hub-spoke oscillation
- DD-F-003 (ISLANDS) -- each spoke is self-contained island
- DD-F-005 (TIDAL) -- width variation
- OD-F-012 (Spatial mapping) -- hub-spoke wayfinding
- OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) -- validated at axis level
- OD-F-007 (Mode-transition breathing) -- 48px+ between transitions

**Validated By:** AD-005

**Equivalence Mechanism:** KINETIC -- axis direction change IS density state
change. The diagonal clip-path that signals "descending into detail"
simultaneously marks the transition from sparse hub to dense spoke. This is
not temporal, spatial, or proportional -- it is kinetic: the act of changing
direction is the act of changing density state.

**Density Pairing:** WAVE (primary) + ISLANDS (secondary)
- Hub: sparse overview with territory card grid (4 columns, 24px gap)
- Diagonal transition: clip-path polygon IS the density boundary
- Spoke: dense detail (constrained width, code examples, callouts)
- Return-to-hub: sparse navigation with "Return to Map" link
- Each spoke is a self-contained ISLAND

**Kinetic Equivalence (AD-F-017):** Axis direction change and density state
change are the same event, not correlated events. The diagonal clip-path IS
both compositional axis signal (direction change) AND density function
(breathing zone). Extends 3-way unification to 4-way equivalence.

**Diagonal as Dual Signal (AD-F-018):** `clip-path: polygon()` encodes both axis
direction AND density phase simultaneously. At mobile, `clip-path: none` removes
compositional function but `border-top: 3px solid` replaces density function --
proving the two signals are separable. May be unique to choreography because
it is the only axis pattern where the transition mechanism itself is a design
element rather than whitespace.

**WAVE Preservation (AD-F-019):** Responsive collapse (4-to-2-to-1 columns)
removes axis geometry but WAVE density oscillation persists. Hub remains sparse
and spoke remains dense because density is controlled by spacing tokens, not
column count or clip-path geometry. Geometry gives WAVE its perceptual character;
tokens give it measurable reality.

**ANTI-PHYSICAL Identity (AD-F-020):** 20 CONDITIONAL PASS R-4 findings --
every one required reinterpretation from "visual movement" to "structural
movement." Cinematic "shot progression" = spacing changes. "Slow panning" =
generous whitespace. "Quick cuts" = abrupt section transitions. Any transition
implying physical object behavior fails the soul test.

**Soul Pieces Verified:** 5/5
- Sharp Edges: border-radius: 0 in :root
- No Shadows: box-shadow: none; solid offset for depth
- Serif = Wisdom: Instrument Serif for territory names, breadcrumbs
- Callout Family DNA: 2-zone (label+body), 4px left border
- Squares Signal System: square territory markers, no radius

**Key Insight:** Choreography is the most surprising axis pattern. "Movement"
in a flat, anti-physical system means movement of the READER's attention, not
CSS animation. This identity clarification resolves the choreography paradox
and confirms that all axis patterns are static structural choreography of
reader attention.

**Cross-Stage References:**
- OD-005 Spatial (organizational pairing)
- DD-001 WAVE + DD-003 ISLANDS (density pairings)

### COMPOUND -- Sequential Multi-Pattern Synthesis

[Z-Pattern] → breathing → [F-Pattern] → breathing → [Bento] → breathing → [Spiral] → breathing → [Choreography]

```

**Status:** VALIDATED (Crown Jewel)

**When to Use:** Content that naturally shifts between organizational modes
within a single document. Best for design system documentation, architectural
overviews, and any meta-documentation demonstrating multiple approaches. Each
section commits to ONE axis pattern; compound effect emerges from the SEQUENCE
of sections through scrolling time.

**Research Provenance:**
- R4-081 (musical structure: verse-chorus-bridge)
- R4-043, R4-052 (sequential composition)
- R4-095, R4-080 (compound topology)
- R2-2.4, R2-3.3 (meta-documentation)
- EXT-AXIS-X-001 through EXT-AXIS-X-008 (compound axis research)
- EXT-AXIS-X-001 (triple equivalence)
- EXT-AXIS-X-002 (transition grammar)
- EXT-AXIS-X-004 (attention topology)
- EXT-AXIS-X-005 (fractal at 5 scales)
- EXT-AXIS-X-008 (meta-documentation as test)
- DD-F-006 (FRACTAL) -- self-similar at 5 scales
- DD-F-010 (Organization serves density)
- DD-F-012 (Axis serves density -- ELEVATED to "axis IS density")
- OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density)
- OD-F-007 (Mode-transition breathing)
- OD-F-009 (Narrative arc compound)

**Validated By:** AD-006

**Equivalence Mechanism:** GRAVITATIONAL + META -- hub is dense because
everything points to it; spokes are sparse because they point to one thing.
Density is topological (connection count), not volumetric. Meta-equivalence:
ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (AD-F-023) -- all mechanisms converge on how content
arrangement shapes attention flow.

**Density Pairing:** ALL patterns (FRACTAL primary)
- Section 1 (Z-Pattern): PULSE emerged
- Section 2 (F-Pattern): CRESCENDO emerged
- Section 3 (Bento Grid): ISLANDS emerged
- Section 4 (Spiral): GEOLOGICAL emerged
- Section 5 (Choreography): WAVE emerged
- Zero manual density manipulation -- each density emerges from axis choice alone

**Compound Is Sequential (AD-F-024):** Multiple axis patterns within a single
viewport create visual cacophony. The correct compound solution: each section
commits to ONE axis pattern; compound effect emerges through scrolling time,
following musical structure (verse-chorus-bridge per R4-081).

**Transition Grammar (AD-F-025):** 5x5 matrix classifying all 20 directed
pattern transitions:

| Type | Count | Characteristic | Example |
|------|-------|----------------|---------|
| Smooth | 4 pairs | Same mechanism, compatible density | Z-to-F, Bento-to-Choreography |
| Bridge | 10 pairs | Different mechanisms, need intermediary | Z-to-Bento, F-to-Spiral |
| Breathing | 6 pairs | Most cognitively distinct, 48px+ gap | All Spiral transitions |

- Choreography is the universal bridge (gravitational density compatible with all)
- Spiral is the most isolated pattern (every Spiral transition requires breathing)

**ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (AD-F-023):** The axis IS the topology. The density IS the
traversal. The organization IS the semantics. Three names for one map. All 5
equivalence mechanisms (temporal, spatial, proportional, kinetic, gravitational)
are perspectives on one phenomenon: how content arrangement shapes attention flow.

**DD-F-006 Fractal at 5 Scales (AD-F-027):** Verified in compound context:
1. Navigation -- pattern echo grid with Hofstadterian strange loop
2. Page -- 7-section CRESCENDO
3. Section -- sparse-dense-sparse internal rhythm across all 7 sections
4. Component -- callout/table/code structures
5. Character -- font trio density signals

**No 6th Fractal Scale (AD-F-028):** The "strategy" candidate collapsed into
existing scales. 5-scale model is complete and universal. CD should verify
existing scales hold under combination, not seek a 6th.

**Soul Pieces Verified:** 5/5
- Sharp Edges: border-radius: 0 in :root
- No Shadows: box-shadow: none; solid offset for depth
- Serif = Wisdom: Instrument Serif for all section headers, essence callouts
- Callout Family DNA: 2-zone (label+body), 4px left border across all sections
- Squares Signal System: square markers throughout all pattern sections

**Key Insight (AD-F-021):** Triple equivalence holds at compound scale. Changing
axis pattern per section automatically changes density AND organization with
zero manual density manipulation. Organization = Density = Axis holds at
compound scale exactly as at individual pattern scale. This is the definitive
proof of OD-F-005 extended to 3-way identity.

**Cross-Stage References:**
- OD-006 Creative/Emergent (organizational pairing -- crown jewel parallel)
- All 6 DD density patterns (compound cycles through all)
- All 5 prior OD organizational patterns (compound demonstrates all)
- OD-F-005, DD-F-012 (ELEVATED to 3-way equivalence)
- AD-001 through AD-005 (compound validates all prior individual patterns)

## The 5 Equivalence Mechanisms

The 3-way unification (axis = organization = density) was validated through 5
distinct mechanisms, unified by a meta-equivalence:

| Mechanism | Source | Creates Density Via | First Identified |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| TEMPORAL | AD-001 (Z), AD-002 (F) | Scanning speed / reading time | Wave 1A |
| SPATIAL | AD-003 (Bento) | Cell size / area allocation | Wave 1B |
| PROPORTIONAL | AD-004 (Spiral) | Golden ratio nesting / confidence encoding | Wave 1B |
| KINETIC | AD-005 (Choreography) | Axis direction change | Wave 1C |
| GRAVITATIONAL | AD-006 (Compound) | Connection count (topological) | Wave 1C |
| **META: ATTENTION TOPOLOGY** | AD-006 (all) | Content arrangement shapes attention flow | AD-F-023 |

## Key Rules

### 1. Axis IS Density IS Organization (AD-F-004, AD-F-023)

Do not treat axis, density, and organization as three separate concerns. Choose
the organizational pattern; the density and axis follow automatically. Three
names for one phenomenon.

### 2. DD-F-006 Fractal at 5 Scales (AD-F-027, AD-F-028)

Every axis pattern MUST demonstrate self-similarity at navigation, page, section,
component, and character scales. No 6th scale exists. The 5-scale model is
complete and universal.

### 3. DD-F-012 ELEVATED: Axis IS Density

Axis geometry does not merely "serve" the density pattern. Axis IS the density
pattern expressed spatially. The relationship is identity (equivalence), not
servitude (subordination). Zero Class C (overwriting) findings across all 28
AD findings confirm this elevation.

### 4. Compound Is Sequential, Not Simultaneous (AD-F-024)

Multiple axis patterns within a single viewport create visual cacophony. Compound
emerges from the SEQUENCE of sections through scrolling time. Each section
commits to ONE axis pattern.

### 5. Transition Grammar (AD-F-025)

All 20 directed pattern transitions are classified: 4 Smooth, 10 Bridge, 6
Breathing. Choreography is the universal bridge. Spiral is the most isolated
(every Spiral transition requires 48px+ breathing per OD-F-007).

### 6. Soul Constraint is Generative

The soul constraint (`border-radius: 0`) is not merely a restriction -- it
generated key AD discoveries. Angular spiral (not curved) IS geological
stratification. Choreography IS reader attention movement (not CSS animation).
Sharp edges make size hierarchy MORE visible in bento grids.

### 7. ANTI-PHYSICAL Identity Confirmed

"Movement" in axis patterns means movement of reader attention through static
structure, not CSS-animated visual elements. 20 CONDITIONAL PASS findings in
AD-005 document the boundary. Any technique implying physical object behavior
fails the soul test.

### 8. Convention Spec Pre-Build Prevents Dialect Problem

AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (822 lines) was created BEFORE builders started, preventing
the 3-dialect divergence that occurred in OD. Result: zero dialect divergence
across 6 AD explorations.

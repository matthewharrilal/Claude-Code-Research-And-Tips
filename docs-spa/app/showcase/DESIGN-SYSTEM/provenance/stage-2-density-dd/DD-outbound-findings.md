# DD OUTBOUND FINDINGS (DD-F-###)
## First Generation of Cross-Stage Research

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## HOW TO USE THIS FILE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every finding has an ID: `DD-F-###`

When you apply a finding, cite it:
- "Applying DD-F-006: Fractal self-similarity at all scales"
- "DD-F-002 pairs CRESCENDO with narrative organization"

**This file is the FIRST LINK in the outbound chain.** DD didn't just produce
density patterns. It produced findings that flow forward to OD, AD, CD, and
Migration. These findings have CHAIN IMPACT — violating them doesn't just
break DD, it breaks everything downstream.

## DENSITY PATTERN FINDINGS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

| ID | Finding | Source | Score | For Which OD | Chain Impact |
|----|---------|--------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| DD-F-001 | **PULSE rhythm (high-low-high) works for alternating content.** Dense INHALE sections alternate with sparse EXHALE sections. Best for tutorials with practice breaks. | DD-001 | 33/40 | OD-001 Conversational | Conversational flow alternates — PULSE is its density partner. Every alternating pattern should use PULSE. |
| DD-F-002 | **CRESCENDO (sparse→dense) creates narrative progression.** Introduction → Context → Details → Resolution. Remove density indicators after section 2 — users learn the pattern. | DD-002 | 35/40 | OD-002 Narrative, OD-004 Confidence | Progressive build pairs with narrative arc. Any "journey" content should use CRESCENDO. |
| DD-F-003 | **ISLANDS (clusters in sparse space) group related content.** Dense archipelagos floating in sparse ocean. Horizontal offsets (left/right/center) create visual rhythm. | DD-003 | 32/40 | OD-003 Task-Based | Task groups are natural density islands. Reference documentation = islands of info. |
| DD-F-004 | **GEOLOGICAL (stacked layers) communicates hierarchy/depth.** Atmosphere (minimal) → Surface (low) → Topsoil (medium) → Subsoil (high) → Bedrock (max). 5-bar depth indicator aids navigation. | DD-004 | 35/40 | OD-004 Confidence | Certainty stratification = geological layering. Expert/Novice paths emerge from layers. |
| DD-F-005 | **TIDAL: Width = inverse density. Narrow channels for dense code, wide rivers for sparse context.** Parallel rivers for comparison. Confluence points for decisions. Delta for choices. | DD-005 | 36/40 | OD-001 Conversational | Width as information signal. Narrow = focused attention. Wide = relaxed absorption. |

## META-PATTERN FINDING (MOST IMPORTANT)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

| ID | Finding | Source | Score | For Which Stage | Chain Impact |
|----|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| DD-F-006 | **FRACTAL: Density pattern at page level MUST mirror section level MUST mirror component level MUST mirror character level.** █░░█░░█░░ at every scale. Self-similarity scored highest. Consistency across scales beats variety. | DD-006 | 36/40 | **ALL ODs, ALL ADs, ALL CDs** | **THE STRONGEST PRINCIPLE.** Apply to every exploration. Don't vary density patterns within a page — be fractal. When DD-006 applied the same rhythm at all 4 scales, it scored highest. This is not coincidence. |

**Why DD-F-006 is the meta-pattern:**
- DD-006 scored 36/40 — tied for highest
- The insight: Self-similarity creates coherence that variety cannot
- When the same dense/sparse rhythm appears at page, section, component, AND
  character levels, documentation feels unified and navigable
- This constrains ALL future work: your page-level rhythm should appear everywhere

## PROCESS FINDINGS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

| ID | Finding | Source | Score | For Which Stage | Chain Impact |
|----|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| DD-F-007 | **Self-similarity scored highest — consistency across scales beats variety.** DD-006's fractal approach outperformed DD-003's variety approach. Don't fight the pattern; repeat it. | DD-006 re-audit | 36/40 | Methodology | Don't vary density patterns within a page — be fractal. Variation is NOT better than consistency. |
| DD-F-008 | **DD-001/DD-003 scored lowest because of anti-pattern violations and underutilized metaphors.** DD-001 had traffic-light (green+red adjacent). DD-003 underused archipelago. | DD re-audit | 33/32 | OD avoidance | Whatever caused low scores, avoid in OD. Anti-patterns are real. Underutilized concepts don't score well. |
| DD-F-009 | **Iteration on perceptual feedback improved scores by average +1.8 points.** DD-001 went from 30.5 to 33. DD-003 went from 30.5 to 32. Re-audit after soul verification works. | DD process | — | Methodology | Iteration WORKS. Don't stop after first attempt. Re-audit after verification. |

## FORWARD-LOOKING FINDINGS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### For OD (Stage 3)

| ID | Finding | Source | How OD Should Apply |
|----|---------|--------|---------------------|
| DD-F-010 | **Organization patterns must SERVE density patterns.** OD-001 → pair with PULSE or TIDAL. OD-002 → pair with CRESCENDO. OD-003 → pair with ISLANDS. OD-004 → pair with GEOLOGICAL. | DD synthesis | OD gate file must map each OD to its density partner. Don't create organization that fights density. |
| DD-F-011 | **Cognitive soul pieces may emerge from OD like visual soul pieces emerged from components.** DD discovered visual rhythm. OD may discover cognitive rhythm. | DD reflection | OD should watch for cognitive patterns that feel like "soul" — document them as new soul pieces. |

### For AD (Stage 4)

| ID | Finding | Source | How AD Should Apply |
|----|---------|--------|---------------------|
| DD-F-012 | **Density patterns imply axis preferences.** CRESCENDO suggests vertical flow (top→bottom progression). ISLANDS suggests grid positioning. RIVERS suggests horizontal channels with varying widths. | DD analysis | Axis geometry must SERVE the density pattern, not fight it. When you choose an axis layout, ask: does this serve my density pattern? |

### For CD (Stage 5)

| ID | Finding | Source | How CD Should Apply |
|----|---------|--------|---------------------|
| DD-F-013 | **Some components compress well at high density, others need breathing room.** Code blocks handle high density. Essence callouts need space around them. | DD observation | Combination rules must account for density tolerance. Don't pack low-tolerance components into high-density zones. |
| DD-F-014 | **Callout stacking creates alarm fatigue regardless of density pattern.** Even in PULSE high-density sections, max 2 callouts visible at once. | DD observation | R5-008 (2-callout limit) applies within ANY density pattern. Density is not license to stack callouts. |

## ANTI-PATTERN FINDINGS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

| ID | Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Discovered In | Prevention |
|----|--------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| DD-F-015 | **Traffic-light colors adjacent.** Green Tip next to Red Gotcha = kindergarten visual language. Undermines editorial authority. | Reduces perceived professionalism; readers see "green means go, red means stop" instead of content | DD-001 initially | Separate green/red with 48px+ whitespace OR neutral component OR reorder to non-adjacent |
| DD-F-016 | **Inconsistent border widths.** Some callouts 2px, some 4px within same exploration. | Breaks family DNA (COMP-F-010). Creates visual noise. | DD-001 initially | Standardize ALL borders to 4px via CSS variable |
| DD-F-017 | **Uniform density throughout.** Same spacing, same rhythm, same everything top to bottom. | No rhythm = monotonous. Reader's eye has nothing to anchor. | Anti-pattern in R-3 | Apply density patterns (PULSE, CRESCENDO, etc.) to create rhythm |
| DD-F-018 | **Fighting the density pattern.** Trying to insert sparse content in dense zone or vice versa. | Creates cognitive dissonance. Reader feels "this doesn't belong here." | Avoided in DD | Let the pattern guide. Dense zones stay dense. Sparse zones stay sparse. |

## HOW STAGE 1 FINDINGS WERE CONSUMED HERE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DD verified ALL explorations against Stage 1 findings:

| COMP-F-### | DD Application |
|------------|----------------|
| COMP-F-001 (Sharp edges) | ✅ All 6 DDs: border-radius: 0 |
| COMP-F-002 (Serif italic) | ✅ All 6 DDs: Essence callouts use Instrument Serif italic |
| COMP-F-003 (2-zone callout) | ✅ All 6 DDs: All callouts 4px left + 2-zone |
| COMP-F-004 (No shadows) | ✅ All 6 DDs: box-shadow: none |
| COMP-F-005 (Square shapes) | ✅ DD-002: Task list checkboxes square |
| COMP-F-010 (4px borders) | ⚠️ DD-001 initially 2px → fixed in DD-002+ |

DD-001's initial 2px borders (violating COMP-F-010) demonstrates that verification
is essential even after Stage 1 remediation.

# CLAUDE.md -- Stage 3: Organization Exploration (OD)

===============================================================================
## 1. IDENTITY
===============================================================================

**Name:** Stage 3: Organization Exploration (OD)
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Anatomical Role:** The cognitive muscles -- where information organization
patterns were discovered and validated.

DD explored visual rhythm. OD explored cognitive rhythm -- and discovered that
organization IS density (OD-F-005). The meta-pattern OD-F-MP-001 proved that
organizational patterns and density patterns are the SAME phenomenon observed
from two perspectives.

===============================================================================
## 2. HOW TO READ
===============================================================================

**Recommended Reading Order:**

1. **`OD-SYNTHESIS.md`** -- Start here for the complete overview of what OD
   discovered, what it consumed, what it produced, and the 6-pattern analysis.

2. **`OD-outbound-findings.md`** -- All 17 OD-F findings with full descriptions,
   chain impact, and validation evidence. This is what flows forward to AD/CD.

3. **`OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md`** -- Quality record: 89 audit findings, 16 fixes
   applied, 0 soul violations, 3 quality dialects, verification results.

4. **`HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md`** -- The gate file for Stage 4 (AD). Contains
   mandatory consumption requirements and constraints for AD work.

5. **`OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md`** -- R-1 finding-by-finding mapping with post-build
   verification showing ~71% application rate.

6. **`STAGE-HEADER.md`** -- Stage overview with all 8 sections: story, consumed,
   produced, quality, decisions, causal relationships, research weight, files.

===============================================================================

## 4. HOW THIS CONNECTS
===============================================================================

### CONSUMED (From Prior Stages)
- `../stage-2-density-dd/DD-outbound-findings.md` -- DD-F-### constraints (18 findings, 100% consumed)
- `../stage-2-density-dd/HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md` -- Entry gate (consumed)
- `../stage-1-components/component-findings.md` -- COMP-F-### constraints (21 findings)
- `../original-research/R1-DOCUMENTATION-PATTERNS.md` -- PRIMARY research (28 findings, ~71% applied)
- `../SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md` -- 5 soul pieces (all verified, no 6th discovered)

### PRODUCED (For Future Stages)
- `OD-outbound-findings.md` -- 17 OD-F findings for AD/CD/Migration
- `HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md` -- Gate file for Stage 4
- `../../patterns/organizational-patterns.md` -- 6 validated organizational patterns
- `../EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md` -- Bespoke research registry

### KEY FINDINGS FOR AD
- **OD-F-005 / OD-F-MP-001:** Organization IS Density -- MANDATORY for all AD work
- **OD-F-FL-001:** Organizational patterns imply axis preferences (transitive chain: org->density->axis)
- **OD-F-AP-001:** 2px border epidemic -- AD must not introduce 2px borders
- **R-2 AD WARNING:** 27 Creative Layout findings at 0% consumption -- AD must evaluate

===============================================================================
## 5. MINDSET
===============================================================================

**OD explored cognitive rhythm and discovered it was the same as visual rhythm.**

The crown jewel discovery: organizational patterns do not "create" density
patterns -- they ARE density patterns. OD-F-005 proved this definitively when
OD-006 cycled through all 5 organizational modes with zero explicit density
manipulation, and each section's density shifted automatically when the
organizational mode shifted.

The five organizational-density identities:
- Conversational Q&A = PULSE
- Narrative Arc = CRESCENDO
- Task Clusters = ISLANDS
- Confidence Strata = GEOLOGICAL
- Spatial Mapping = WAVE

No new cognitive soul piece was discovered -- the 5 visual soul pieces govern
both density and organization. This is itself a significant finding.

**For AD agents:** The transitive chain org->density->axis means when you choose
an axis layout, you are simultaneously choosing an organizational-density
configuration. The three cannot be separated. Read OD-F-FL-001 for per-pattern
axis preferences.

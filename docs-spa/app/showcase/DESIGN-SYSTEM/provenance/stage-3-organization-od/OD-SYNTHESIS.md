# OD-SYNTHESIS
## Stage 3 -- Organizational Explorations: Complete Synthesis

---

## 1. The OD Story

OD explored cognitive rhythm -- how information should be ORGANIZED. Six explorations
were built, each pairing an organizational pattern with a density pattern from DD.
The stage consumed HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD (the transition mandate from Stage 2), all 18
DD-F findings, 21 COMP-F findings, 28 R-1 documentation pattern findings, 39 R-5
combination theory findings, and bespoke external research (EXT-*) commissioned for
all 6 ODs. The stage produced 6 HTML exploration artifacts, 17 OD-F findings
(13 core pattern findings + 4 categorical: 1 meta-pattern, 1 process, 1 forward-looking, 1 anti-pattern),
the organizational-patterns catalog, the EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY, and HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.

OD-001 Conversational proved that Q&A structure IS PULSE density -- questions sparse,
answers dense, the alternation automatic. OD-002 Narrative proved that story arc IS
CRESCENDO density -- exposition sparse, climax dense, the build inherent. OD-003
Task-Based proved that procedural clusters ARE ISLANDS density -- discrete task blocks
dense, surrounding navigation sparse. OD-004 Confidence-Based proved that certainty
stratification IS GEOLOGICAL density -- established knowledge compresses, speculative
knowledge expands. OD-005 Spatial proved that hub-and-spoke IS WAVE density -- sparse
hub overviews oscillate with dense spoke content. OD-006 Creative synthesized all five
into the meta-discovery OD-F-005: "Organization IS Density" -- the organizational
pattern does not create density; it IS density. Same phenomenon, two perspectives.

All 6 ODs passed visual audit with zero soul violations across 3,479+ DOM elements.
Zero border-radius violations. Zero box-shadow violations. The 5 visual soul pieces
remain intact and complete -- no new cognitive soul piece was discovered (this is
itself a significant negative finding). The 2px border epidemic (108 CSS declarations,
1000+ computed instances) was identified as the #1 systemic issue and has been
substantially remediated through re-enrichment (11 2px borders eliminated in Wave 3
alone). Three quality dialects emerged: Polished (OD-001/002), Functional
(OD-003/004/005), and Editorial (OD-006). The dialect gap has been RESOLVED through
convention unification (OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md) applied across all 6 ODs during
re-enrichment.

## 4. 3-Quality-Dialect Analysis -- RESOLVED

The fresh-eyes adversarial audit (F-E agent, 2026-02-07) identified three quality
dialects across the 6 ODs. The dialect gap was subsequently RESOLVED through
re-enrichment (Waves 1-3, 2026-02-09) using the OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md unified
convention applied across all 6 ODs.

### Dialect A: Polished (OD-001, OD-002)

**Pre-Re-Enrichment Characteristics:**
- Dark code blocks with VS Code-style syntax highlighting
- Scroll-witness sidebar (OD-001)
- Full-bleed headers with dark background
- Solid offset pseudo-elements (OD-001)
- Fewer thin-border instances (OD-001: 101 computed, OD-002: 46 computed)
- Felt like "v2 products" -- refined, deliberate, crafted

**Post-Re-Enrichment (v3):**
- OD-001: 37/40 (+2). 6 new EXT-CONV findings (EXT-CONV-006 through 011). Zone token naming
  validated (--color-zone-sparse/dense/breathing). Semi-transparent offsets fixed (opacity: 1).
  5 builder discoveries. R1-020 + R1-028 applied.
- OD-002: 35/40 (+2). 11 new EXT-NARR findings (EXT-NARR-001 through 011). Freytag 5-beat
  narrative structure. Progressive disclosure labels. Research Debt RD-1 RESOLVED (OD-002
  now has external research).

### Dialect B: Functional (OD-003, OD-004, OD-005)

**Pre-Re-Enrichment Characteristics:**
- Light code blocks (cream-on-cream) -- less visually distinct
- No scroll-witness sidebar
- Simpler headers with horizontal metadata bars
- Widest range of thin borders (OD-003: 661 computed thin-border instances -- worst of all ODs)
- Higher page heights (OD-003: 19,829px, OD-005: 19,247px -- longest ODs)
- Felt like "v1 products" -- functional but less refined

**Post-Re-Enrichment (v3):**
- OD-003: ~35/40 (+2). 7 new EXT-TASK findings (EXT-TASK-013 through 019). Collapsible
  islands (EXT-TASK-018) transform ISLANDS from spatial pattern to navigation paradigm.
  Dark code blocks applied per convention. Off-palette accent-tan fully removed.
- OD-004: 34/40 (+1). 6 new EXT-CONF findings (EXT-CONF-013 through 018). Border-weight
  gradient (4px/3px/2px/1px) makes geological metaphor visible at page scale. Dark header +
  zone tokens + type-meta fix. 6x 2px borders eliminated.
- OD-005: 35/40 (+2). 6 new EXT-SPAT findings (EXT-SPAT-013 through 018). Territory-tile
  hover transform spirit violation RESOLVED (replaced with flat 2D hover). Dark header creates
  3-phase density cascade. WAVE self-documentation via sidebar indicator.

### Dialect C: Editorial (OD-006)

**Pre-Re-Enrichment Characteristics:**
- No code blocks (meta-documentary content)
- Strongest typography conviction (massive display serif, serif italic, editorial drop caps)
- Heaviest use of #1A1A1A for borders and text (darker, more assertive)
- Most fractal of all ODs (4 scales demonstrated thoroughly)
- Pattern gallery (2x3 grid comparing all 6 OD approaches)
- Felt deliberately different as the synthesis page

**Post-Re-Enrichment (v3):**
- OD-006: 37/40 (+1). 6 new EXT-CREATIVE findings (EXT-CREATIVE-010 through 015). 5th fractal
  scale (navigation) emerged from combining enrichment techniques. R1-020 + R1-028 applied.
  Zone tokens bookend-validated with OD-001. 5x 2px borders eliminated. Territory-tile hover
  spirit violation resolved.

### Dialect Gap Resolution

The dialect gap between Dialect A and Dialect B has been RESOLVED through convention
unification. The OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (468 lines) defined a unified standard for:

1. **Dark code blocks:** All 6 ODs now use dark code blocks (#1A1A1A background)
2. **Dark header:** All 6 ODs now use dark full-bleed header per convention
3. **Type scale:** All 6 ODs share the convention type scale (OD-006's 3rem sanctioned)
4. **Zone tokens:** --color-zone-sparse/dense/breathing naming applied to all 6 ODs
5. **Border system:** 3-category system (structural/separator/micro) applied uniformly
6. **--type-meta:** Unified to 0.75rem (12px) across all 6 ODs

The convention spec was built FROM OD-001's type scale (the best existing implementation),
formalized, and then applied to all other ODs. The result: the 3 dialects still have
distinct character (conversational, functional, editorial) but share a unified convention
baseline. The gap is now intentional variation, not inconsistency.

## 5. Key Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Why | Impact |
|---|----------|-----|--------|
| 1 | OD-006 as emergent synthesis exploration | DD-006 established the FRACTAL meta-pattern; OD-006 needed to be the equivalent synthesis for organizational patterns, proving the meta-insight | Crown jewel artifact. OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density" is the stage's signature discovery. |
| 2 | 2px borders treated as systemic issue, not soul violation | The 5 soul pieces specify border-radius: 0 and box-shadow: none. They do NOT specify minimum border width. Rule 5 ("1px borders signal uncertainty") is from the identity brief, not the locked soul. | 108 CSS declarations flagged for remediation. Substantially remediated during re-enrichment (11 eliminated in Wave 3, plus Wave 1+2 remediation). |
| 3 | No new cognitive soul piece discovered | Despite the OD stage's mandate to watch for cognitive soul pieces (how information FLOWS), no pattern achieved soul-level status. The 5 visual soul pieces remain the complete set. | Future stages (AD, CD) may still discover cognitive soul pieces, but OD produced none. |
| 4 | Bespoke research (EXT-*) commissioned for ALL 6 ODs | Original build: 4 of 6 ODs received bespoke research. Re-enrichment: ALL 6 ODs received bespoke research, resolving OD-002's Research Debt RD-1. | 94 unique EXT-* findings applied total. Application rate ~100% for re-enrichment findings. |
| 5 | Convention unification through OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md | The 3-dialect gap was a craftsmanship inconsistency. A unified convention built FROM the best OD (OD-001) and applied to all 6 resolves this without destroying each OD's distinct character. | Dialect gap RESOLVED. All 6 ODs share baseline convention while retaining identity. |
| 6 | R-2 Creative Layouts deferred entirely | R-2 has 27 findings at 0% consumption by OD. The organizational stage focused on R-1 (documentation patterns) as primary research. R-2 is reserved for AD (axis) stage. | 27 findings remain untapped. HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD must flag R-2 as mandatory reading. |
| 7 | OD-F collision (builder-log vs OD-CHECKPOINT) resolved | builder-log.md defined OD-F-005-009 for OD-002 findings. OD-CHECKPOINT defined OD-F-005-008 for OD-006 findings. The OD-006 definitions had 10+ downstream citations; the builder-log definitions had 0. | RESOLVED: Source A (OD-CHECKPOINT) is canonical. builder-log OD-002 findings renumbered to OD-F-009 through OD-F-013 per OD-outbound-findings.md. |
| 8 | All 6 ODs marked INCLUDE with numeric scores | Every OD demonstrates its organizational hypothesis validly. Re-enrichment elevated all 6 to numeric scores (34-37/40). The AD stage inherits all 6 organizational patterns as available vocabulary. | All 6 patterns VALIDATED with scores. Range compressed from 33-36 to 34-37. |

---

## 6. Negative Space (What OD Did NOT Find)

### 6a. No New Cognitive Soul Piece

The OD stage was explicitly charged with watching for cognitive soul pieces -- patterns
in how information FLOWS that achieve the same immutable status as the 5 visual soul
pieces (Sharp Edges, No Shadows, Serif=Wisdom, Callout Family DNA, Squares Signal System).

**Result:** No candidate emerged. The organizational patterns create density, but no
single organizational principle rose to the level of "this cannot be changed without
destroying the system's identity." The closest candidate was "Organization IS Density"
(OD-F-005), but this is a meta-observation about the relationship between two pattern
categories, not a prescriptive soul constraint.

The 5 visual soul pieces remain the complete set.

### 6b. R-2 Creative Layouts: 27 Findings at 0% Consumption

R-2 contains 27 findings about creative layout approaches. None were consumed by any
OD exploration. The organizational stage focused exclusively on R-1 (documentation
patterns) as its primary research stream. R-2's creative layout findings were bypassed
in favor of bespoke EXT-CREATIVE research commissioned specifically for OD-006.

This means 27 validated research findings remain entirely untapped. The AD stage MUST
address this gap -- HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD carries R-2 as a mandatory consumption target.

### 6c. ANTI-PHYSICAL Identity Pattern (20/20 SOUL FAILs)

Across all 3 re-enrichment waves, 20 external research findings were rejected as
SOUL FAILs. Every single one follows the ANTI-PHYSICAL pattern:

- Wave 1 (6/6): Depth illusions, overlapping elements, card animations, rounded progress bars, gradient transitions, blur animations
- Wave 2 (7/7): Decorative depth shadows, rounded hierarchy, gradient connectors, animated step transitions, transform hover lift, scale-up hover, CSS perspective/3D
- Wave 3 (7/7): Gradients, traffic-light colors, animated reveals, rounded badges, depth/motion/parallax

The system consistently rejects anything that makes flat screens pretend to be
three-dimensional spaces. Categories: (a) decorative depth/shadows, (b) animated
z-movement, (c) rounded shapes suggesting physical objects, (d) gradients suggesting
light/material, (e) traffic-light color semantics implying material signals, (f)
parallax implying z-space.

This is NOT a new soul piece (it's a pattern in what the soul rejects, not a
prescriptive rule). But it is a critical diagnostic tool: any future technique
can be tested against the ANTI-PHYSICAL filter.

---

## 7. Emergence Tracking: OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density"

### Observation (OD-001)

OD-001 Conversational discovered that Q&A structure NATURALLY creates PULSE density.
The question is sparse (low information density, typographic breathing room). The answer
is dense (high information density, tighter spacing, code blocks). This alternation
happens automatically -- no explicit density annotation is needed.

Finding OD-F-003: "Q&A as Natural PULSE Generator -- Q&A pairs are inherent PULSE
generators: question=LOW density, answer=HIGH density. No artificial density
manipulation needed."

### Hypothesis (OD-002 through OD-005)

As each subsequent OD was built, the same pattern repeated:
- OD-002: Narrative arc creates CRESCENDO without explicit density markers
- OD-003: Task clusters form ISLANDS without explicit density boundaries
- OD-004: Confidence strata create GEOLOGICAL layers without explicit density annotation
- OD-005: Hub-spoke creates WAVE without explicit density oscillation

Each organizational pattern generated its paired density pattern as an inherent
property, not as an imposed layer. The hypothesis formed: maybe the organizational
pattern and the density pattern are not two separate things.

### Evidence (OD-006 Sections 1-5)

OD-006 Creative tested this hypothesis by building a meta-documentation page that
uses all 5 prior organizational patterns in sequence. Each section adopts a different
organizational mode:

- Section 1: Conversational (Q&A about what the system is) -- PULSE density emerged
- Section 2: Narrative (the story of how the system was built) -- CRESCENDO density emerged
- Section 3: Task-Based (how to use the system) -- ISLANDS density emerged
- Section 4: Confidence-Based (what we know vs what we speculate) -- GEOLOGICAL density emerged
- Section 5: Spatial (map of the system's territories) -- WAVE density emerged

In each section, zero explicit density manipulation was performed. The density emerged
from the organizational structure alone.

### Conclusion (OD-F-005)

"The organizational pattern does not 'create' density -- it IS density. Same phenomenon
observed from two perspectives. Conversational Q&A does not 'create' PULSE; conversational
Q&A IS PULSE. Narrative arc does not 'create' CRESCENDO; narrative arc IS CRESCENDO. The
distinction between organization and density is artificial."

This meta-insight collapses the two-layer model (organization + density) into a single-layer
model (organization-density). The practical implication: when building future explorations
(AD, CD), choosing an organizational pattern automatically determines the density pattern.
No separate density annotation or manipulation is needed.

### Re-Enrichment Validation

Re-enrichment confirmed OD-F-005 at the TOKEN level. Zone token naming
(--color-zone-sparse/dense/breathing) encodes both spatial architecture ("zone") AND
density dimension ("sparse/dense/breathing") in a single name. Validated as bookend
pair: OD-001 (first) and OD-006 (crown jewel) both carry zone tokens. The token itself
IS the proof of organizational-density equivalence.

---

## 8. Scoring Summary

### Rubric

All ODs were evaluated on 4 dimensions (10 points each, 40 total):

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Innovation** | Does this OD demonstrate something new about organizational patterns? |
| **Utility** | Would this organizational approach serve real documentation needs? |
| **Soul Compliance** | Does the implementation honor all 5 soul pieces and locked tokens? |
| **Execution** | Is the HTML artifact well-crafted? Typography, spacing, rhythm, code quality? |

### Per-OD Scores (Post-Re-Enrichment v3)

| OD | Innovation | Utility | Soul | Execution | Total | Delta | Decision |
|----|-----------|---------|------|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| OD-001 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 9 | **37/40** | +2 | INCLUDE |
| OD-002 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 9 | **35/40** | +2 | INCLUDE |
| OD-003 | -- | -- | -- | -- | **~35/40** | +2 | INCLUDE |
| OD-004 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8 | **34/40** | +1 | INCLUDE |
| OD-005 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 | **35/40** | +2 | INCLUDE |
| OD-006 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9 | **37/40** | +1 | INCLUDE (crown jewel) |

**Notes:**
- All 6 ODs now have numeric scores with per-dimension breakdowns.
- OD-003 has approximate scores from builder self-report (not independently verified per-dimension).
- All 6 passed re-enrichment verification gates (Waves 1-3, 60/60 checks + 15/15 provenance checks).
- Zero soul violations across all 6 re-enriched ODs.

**Score Range:** 34/40 to 37/40. Average: ~35.5/40.

### Comparison to DD Scores

DD scores ranged from 30/40 (DD-001 DOCUMENT) to 36/40 (DD-005 TIDAL, DD-006 FRACTAL).
Post-re-enrichment OD scores range from 34/40 to 37/40 -- a tighter and HIGHER range than DD.
The OD stage has a higher minimum quality floor (34 vs 30) and the crown jewel (OD-006 at 37)
exceeds DD's highest (36). Re-enrichment compressed the quality range from 4 points (pre) to
3 points (post).

## 10. Cross-OD Lessons

### Lesson 1: Organization-Density Equivalence (OD-F-005)

The signature cross-OD insight. Every organizational pattern generates its paired density
pattern as an inherent property. This was not planned -- it emerged through building 6
explorations and observing the same phenomenon 6 times. Re-enrichment confirmed this at
the token level through zone token naming.

### Lesson 2: Bespoke Research Outperforms Pre-Existing

OD-001 (v3 enriched with 11 EXT-CONV) scored 37/40. OD-002 (v3 with 11 EXT-NARR) scored
35/40. The pattern holds: ODs with bespoke research score higher. Re-enrichment eliminated
OD-002's research debt entirely -- all 6 ODs now have bespoke research.

### Lesson 3: Convention Unification Resolves Dialect Gap

Pre-re-enrichment, 3 dialects created visible inconsistency. Post-re-enrichment, the
OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md unified baseline (dark code blocks, dark header, zone tokens, type
scale, border system) resolves the gap while preserving each OD's distinct character.

### Lesson 4: Fractal Compliance Is Universal (5 Scales in Crown Jewel)

All 6 ODs demonstrate DD-F-006 fractal self-similarity at 4 scales (page, section,
component, character). OD-006's re-enrichment revealed a 5th scale: NAVIGATION. The
combination of fractal annotation layer + pattern echo grid + fractal TOC creates an
emergent navigation scale where the document reflects itself at 5 levels.

### Lesson 5: Soul Compliance Is Complete

Zero violations across all 6 re-enriched ODs. The locked token approach (identical :root
blocks) ensures soul compliance mechanically. Re-enrichment additionally verified 20/20
SOUL FAIL pattern (ANTI-PHYSICAL) -- the soul consistently rejects any technique creating
perceived depth, movement, or three-dimensionality.

### Lesson 6: Dark Header as Universal Amplifier

Every wave confirmed: the dark header creates a stronger LANDMARK effect regardless of
organizational pattern. Wave 1 (conversational/narrative), Wave 2 (task-based/spatial),
Wave 3 (confidence/creative) -- all 3 waves validated the convention spec's dark header
as a universal improvement.

### Lesson 7: The 2px Border Epidemic -- Substantial Remediation

Original: 108 CSS declarations, 1000+ computed instances. The 3-category border system
(structural 3px+ / separator 2px / micro 1px) was applied during re-enrichment. Wave 3
alone eliminated 11 2px structural borders (6 in OD-004, 5 in OD-006). The border-weight
gradient in OD-004 (4px/3px/2px/1px encoding confidence levels) demonstrates that semantic
encoding and the 3-category system coexist on ORTHOGONAL axes (Y=semantic, X=separator).

### Lesson 8: ISLANDS Dual Mode Discovery

Re-enrichment discovered that ISLANDS has two modes: static (spatial arrangement) and
interactive (wayfinding system via collapse/expand). Builder-2a's `<details>` wrapping
(EXT-TASK-018) in OD-003 created the first OD where the READER controls density distribution.
This is a compound pattern: ISLANDS + CRESCENDO simultaneously at different scales.

**Legend:** X = consumed, -- = self (not applicable)

**Key observation:** OD-006 consumed ALL prior ODs plus ALL DD sources plus the convention
spec. It is the most heavily sourced artifact in the entire OD stage (and possibly the
entire pipeline). Post-re-enrichment, OD-002 is no longer the lowest-sourced -- it now
has 11 EXT-NARR resources plus R1 findings, bringing it to parity with other ODs.

## 12. RE-ENRICHMENT DELTA

### Overview

Re-enrichment (Waves 0-3, 2026-02-08 to 2026-02-09) applied the OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md
unified convention and 42 new EXT-* research findings across all 6 ODs. The process
used a gate-based team topology: researcher + builder + scribe + verifier per wave,
with Wave 0 producing the convention spec and before-state measurements.

### Before/After Scores

| OD | Before | After (v3) | Delta | Innovation | Utility | Soul | Execution |
|----|--------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|------|-----------|
| OD-001 | ~35/40 | 37/40 | +2 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 9 |
| OD-002 | ~33/40 | 35/40 | +2 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 9 |
| OD-003 | ~33/40 | ~35/40 | +2 | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| OD-004 | ~33 (est) | 34/40 | +1 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8 |
| OD-005 | ~33 (est) | 35/40 | +2 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 |
| OD-006 | ~36 (est) | 37/40 | +1 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9 |
| **Average** | **~33.8** | **~35.5** | **+1.7** | | | | |

Score range compressed from ~33-36 (3-point spread) to 34-37 (3-point spread, higher floor).

### Convention Spec Impact

The OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (468 lines) was produced in Wave 0 and applied across all
6 ODs in Waves 1-3. Key unification effects:

1. **Dark code blocks:** Unified #1A1A1A background across all 6 ODs (previously only Dialect A)
2. **Dark header:** Universal amplifier validated across all 3 waves
3. **Type scale:** 6-level cascade (--type-page through --type-meta) shared by all ODs. OD-006's 3rem page size sanctioned as legitimate divergence.
4. **Zone tokens:** --color-zone-sparse/dense/breathing naming adopted, proving OD-F-005 at the token level
5. **Border 3-category system:** Structural (3px+), separator (2px), micro (1px) applied uniformly
6. **--type-meta:** Unified from 10px to 12px (0.75rem)
7. **Reduced-motion:** Comprehensive `*, *::before, *::after { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important }` prophylactic rule

### Identity Evolution Summary (from 3 Identity Deltas)

**Wave 1 (OD-001 + OD-002):**
- Solid offsets MUST be fully opaque (opacity === 1). Binary gate, not judgment call.
- Zone token naming IS OD-F-005 in action at the token level.
- Progressive disclosure labels transform passive readers into active participants.
- Freytag falling action as cognitive decompression (CRESCENDO needs formal exhale).
- ANTI-PHYSICAL identity discovered: 6/6 SOUL FAILs reject depth/motion/ornamentation.

**Wave 2 (OD-003 + OD-005):**
- ISLANDS dual mode: static (spatial) and interactive (wayfinding via collapse/expand).
- Compound density confirmed: OD-003 achieves ISLANDS + CRESCENDO simultaneously at different scales.
- Dark header amplification stronger on spatial layouts (3-phase cascade).
- Zone token dual semantics: "zone" (spatial) + "sparse/dense" (density) in one name.
- Static vs animated offset is a binary rule: does the offset MOVE? Yes = FAIL. No = PASS.
- 13/13 SOUL FAILs cumulative ANTI-PHYSICAL.

**Wave 3 (OD-004 + OD-006):**
- Border-weight gradient makes geological metaphor VISIBLE at page scale (flat 2D encoding, not physical depth).
- 5th fractal scale (navigation) in crown jewel -- emerges from technique combination, not design intent.
- Semi-transparent backgrounds are systemic (rgba < 1.0 survives multiple review layers).
- 3-category border system and semantic encoding coexist on ORTHOGONAL axes.
- Zone token naming carries QUADRUPLE validation (bookend OD-001 + OD-006).
- 20/20 SOUL FAILs cumulative ANTI-PHYSICAL -- zero exceptions.

### Key Discoveries (27 Total)

**Wave 1 (10 discoveries):**
- Builder-1a: 5 discoveries (semi-transparent offset fix, zone token naming, convention type scale inheritance, dark code blocks, R1-020/R1-028 integration)
- Builder-1b: 5 discoveries (progressive disclosure labels, Freytag 5-beat validation, editorial pillar enrichment, micro/macro pacing markers, tension meter scrollytelling upgrade)

**Wave 2 (8 discoveries):**
- Builder-2a: 4 discoveries (collapsible islands wayfinding, dark header archipelago map, compound ISLANDS+CRESCENDO, task-map grid enhancement)
- Builder-2b: 4 discoveries (WAVE self-documentation sidebar, keyboard spatial navigation, 3-phase density cascade, static offset replacement for spirit violation)

**Wave 3 (9 discoveries):**
- Builder-3a (B3A-001..005): 5 discoveries (semi-transparent background elimination, border-weight orthogonal axes, zone-token type scale alignment, dark header + zone-color integration, --type-meta tokenization)
- Builder-3b (B3B-001..004): 4 discoveries (5th fractal scale emergence, convention border gap asymmetry, zone token bookend validation, Quintuple Equivalence hypothesis)

### The 20/20 SOUL FAIL Pattern (ANTI-PHYSICAL)

All 20 external research findings rejected as SOUL FAILs across 3 waves share one pattern:
they attempt to make flat screens simulate three-dimensional physical space. The identity
is ANTI-PHYSICAL. This extends even to metaphors: OD-004's geological layering achieves
depth through 2D border-weight encoding (flat), not shadows or transforms (physical).

The ANTI-PHYSICAL pattern is diagnostic, not prescriptive: it predicts which future
techniques will fail soul compliance before they are attempted.

### The 5th Fractal Scale Discovery

DD-F-006 specified 4 fractal scales: page, section, component, character. OD-006's
re-enrichment discovered a 5th: NAVIGATION. The combination of fractal annotation layer
(EXT-CREATIVE-010) + pattern echo grid (EXT-CREATIVE-013) + fractal TOC (EXT-CREATIVE-012)
creates an emergent navigation scale where the document reflects itself at navigation, page,
section, component, and character levels. The 5th scale emerges from the combination of
enrichment techniques, not from any single one.

### Zone Token Validation (Bookend Pair)

Zone tokens (--color-zone-sparse, --color-zone-dense, --color-zone-breathing) were
first introduced in OD-001 (Wave 1) and independently validated in OD-006 (Wave 3).
This bookend pair proves OD-F-005 at the token level: the token name itself encodes
both spatial architecture ("zone") and density dimension ("sparse/dense/breathing").
The naming convention communicates dual semantics in a single identifier.

### Dark Header Universality

The convention spec's dark full-bleed header (#1A1A1A background) was validated as a
universal amplifier across all 6 ODs:
- Wave 1: Conversational (OD-001) + Narrative (OD-002) -- 2-phase density cascade
- Wave 2: Task-Based (OD-003) + Spatial (OD-005) -- 3-phase density cascade (landmark-breathing-content)
- Wave 3: Confidence (OD-004) + Creative (OD-006) -- geological anchoring + editorial authority

The dark header creates a stronger LANDMARK effect regardless of organizational pattern.

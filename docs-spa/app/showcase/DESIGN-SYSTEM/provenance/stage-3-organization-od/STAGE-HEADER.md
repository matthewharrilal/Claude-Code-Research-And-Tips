INLINE THREADING HEADER -- Phase 2B
File: docs-spa/app/showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/stage-3-organization-od/STAGE-HEADER.md
Tier: B | Batch: 6 | Generated: 2026-02-06

1. WHY THIS EXISTS
Stage header for the Organization Exploration (OD) pipeline stage. Defines
what OD explored (cognitive rhythm -- how information is ORGANIZED), lists
the 6 explorations (OD-001 through OD-006), specifies mandatory inputs
(HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md, DD-F-006 fractal self-similarity), and records the
scoring outcomes. Part of the predecessor/successor stage chain.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
What did Stage 3 (OD) consume, what did it produce, what quality was achieved,
and what constraints flow forward to Stage 4 (AD)?

3. STATUS
COMPLETE -- All 6 OD explorations built, audited, and fixed. All synthesis
documents produced. All outbound findings documented. HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD
produced. Stage is closed.

5. BUILT ON

6. MUST HONOR
- Predecessor/successor chain format must be maintained (frontmatter links)
- DD-F-006 (fractal self-similarity) was MANDATORY for all OD explorations
- 5 soul pieces verified in every exploration
- Scoring threshold: >=32 for INCLUDE (all 6 met threshold)
- HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md was read FIRST before all OD work

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
- Are all 17 OD-F findings (OD-F-001 through OD-F-013, OD-F-MP-001,
  OD-F-PR-001, OD-F-FL-001, OD-F-AP-001) documented in OD-outbound-findings.md?
- Does the frontmatter predecessor/successor chain remain intact with stage-2
  and stage-4 STAGE-HEADERs?
- Are the mandatory inputs (HANDOFF, DD-outbound, SOUL-DISCOVERIES, R1, R5)
  correctly listed as consumed?
- Is the OD-F-005 collision resolution documented?

# STAGE 3: ORGANIZATION EXPLORATION (OD)
## COMPLETE -- Where Cognitive Rhythm Was Discovered

===============================================================================
## 1. THE STORY
===============================================================================

DD explored visual rhythm -- how content BREATHES on a page.
OD explored cognitive rhythm -- how information should be ORGANIZED.

Six explorations were built, each pairing an organizational pattern with a
density pattern from DD. The meta-pattern OD-F-005 "Organization IS Density"
emerged from OD-006: the organizational pattern does not "create" density --
it IS density. Same phenomenon observed from two perspectives. Conversational
Q&A IS PULSE. Narrative arc IS CRESCENDO. Task clusters ARE ISLANDS. Confidence
stratification IS GEOLOGICAL. Spatial mapping IS WAVE.

OD-001 Conversational proved that Q&A structure IS PULSE density -- questions
sparse, answers dense, the alternation automatic. OD-002 Narrative proved that
story arc IS CRESCENDO density -- exposition sparse, climax dense, the build
inherent. OD-003 Task-Based proved that procedural clusters ARE ISLANDS density
-- discrete task blocks dense, surrounding navigation sparse. OD-004
Confidence-Based proved that certainty stratification IS GEOLOGICAL density --
established knowledge compresses, speculative knowledge expands. OD-005 Spatial
proved that hub-and-spoke IS WAVE density -- sparse hub overviews oscillate
with dense spoke content. OD-006 Creative synthesized all five into the crown
jewel discovery OD-F-005, with zero explicit density manipulation needed.

No new cognitive soul piece was discovered -- the 5 visual soul pieces
(sharp edges, flat surfaces, serif/sans hierarchy, callout family DNA, square
markers) remained intact and complete. This negative finding is itself
significant: density and organization are governed by the same soul.

## 4. QUALITY ACHIEVED
===============================================================================

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Average score | >=32/40 for INCLUDE | OD-001: ~35/40, OD-002: ~33/40, OD-003: ~33/40, OD-004: INCLUDE, OD-005: INCLUDE, OD-006: INCLUDE (crown jewel, targeting >=36/40) |
| Soul compliance | 100% | 100% -- 0 border-radius violations, 0 box-shadow violations across 3,479+ DOM elements |
| Anti-pattern violations | 0 | 0 soul violations. 2px border epidemic identified (108 CSS decls) but NOT a soul violation -- fixed via 3-category system |
| Audit findings | -- | 89 total: 8 Critical, 6 High, 16 Medium, 8 Low, ~51 Notes |
| Fixes applied | -- | 16/16 actionable fixes applied (commit f5357a7), 2 false positives disproved, 1 deferred |
| R-1 application rate | >=80% | ~71% (20/28 applied) -- below target, bespoke EXT-* at ~85% |
| R-2 application rate | -- | 0% (27 findings unconsumed -- AD WARNING) |
| EXT-* application rate | -- | ~85% (bespoke research) |
| Locked token consistency | 100% | 12/12 locked tokens IDENTICAL across all 6 ODs |
| Post-fix verification | 100% PASS | 187 programmatic DOM tests PASS + 12 visual screenshots PASS |

**3 Quality Dialects:**
- **Polished** (OD-001, OD-002): Dark code blocks, v2 enrichments, full-bleed headers
- **Functional** (OD-003, OD-004, OD-005): Lighter code blocks, more thin borders, simpler headers
- **Editorial** (OD-006): No code blocks, meta-documentary style, heaviest typography

===============================================================================
## 5. KEY DECISIONS
===============================================================================

1. **OD-006 as emergent synthesis:** OD-006 was not a planned pattern but emerged as a meta-documentation page demonstrating all 5 prior OD patterns, producing the crown jewel finding OD-F-005.

2. **2px-to-3px border fix:** The 2px border epidemic (108 CSS declarations, 1,619 computed instances) was resolved via 3-category system: Category 1 (structural frames) upgraded to 3px, Category 2 (table separators) left at 2px, Category 3 (micro-elements) left at 2px.

3. **No new soul piece:** Despite exploring cognitive rhythm as potential new territory, no 6th soul piece was discovered. The 5 visual soul pieces govern both density and organization.

4. **Bespoke research model:** EXT-* research (created specifically per-OD) achieved ~85% application vs R-1 broad research at ~71%. Bespoke, targeted research is more easily consumed than pre-existing broad research.

5. **R-2 deferred to AD:** R-2 Creative Layouts (27 findings) achieved 0% consumption by OD. These findings are carried forward as an explicit AD WARNING -- AD must evaluate R-2 applicability before building.

6. **OD-F-005 collision resolved:** Finding IDs OD-F-005 through OD-F-008 had competing definitions from OD-006 (Source A) and builder-log OD-002 (Source B). Resolved: Source A canonical (10+ downstream citations), Source B renumbered to OD-F-009 through OD-F-013.

7. **Essence font false positive:** OD-004 Essence callout font FAIL (the only explicit FAIL in audit) was disproved via Playwright investigation -- font-loading timing artifact. `document.fonts.ready` required before checking computed font.

8. **Dead zone false positive:** OD-001 dead zone finding was disproved -- scroll-animation artifact, not structural gap.

9. **17-agent adversarial audit:** The OD Granular Adversarial Audit used 17 agents across 4 phases (~45 min), producing 89 findings with 10 confirmed multi-agent cross-references.

10. **Fix #17 deferred:** Header meta layout inconsistency deferred as subjective/out-of-scope.

===============================================================================
## 6. CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS
===============================================================================

### OD -> AD (Forward Chain)

OD findings flow directly into AD work via three mechanisms:

1. **OD-F-FL-001 (Organizational Patterns Imply Axis Preferences):** Each org pattern has a natural axis geometry preference. The TRANSITIVE CHAIN is: organizational pattern (OD-F-005) implies density pattern (DD-F-001 through DD-F-005) implies axis preference (DD-F-012). AD receives all three constraints simultaneously.

2. **OD-F-MP-001 (Organization = Density Identity):** When choosing an axis layout, AD is simultaneously choosing an organizational-density configuration. The three cannot be separated.

3. **OD-F-AP-001 (2px Border Epidemic):** AD must not introduce 2px borders. The 3-category border system must be enforced.

### DD -> OD (Backward Chain)

OD consumed all 18 DD-F findings. DD-F-016 (consistent 4px borders) was the ONLY DD-F constraint not fully honored initially -- the 2px border epidemic violated it. All other DD-F constraints were fully honored:
- DD-F-006 (FRACTAL): Applied to ALL 6 ODs, verified in 4-scale fractal
- DD-F-010 (Org serves density): ELEVATED to identity (OD-F-005: org IS density)
- DD-F-014 (Max 2 callouts): Enforced across all 6 ODs
- DD-F-015 (No traffic-light): Zero violations across all 6 ODs

### DD Audit Methodology -> OD Audit (Methodological Chain)

DD audit methodology evolved through `checkpoints/RETROACTIVE-AUDIT-DD-001-006.md` and `checkpoints/VISUAL-AUDIT-*` checkpoint files, establishing the multi-agent adversarial audit approach. This methodology was scaled up for the OD 17-agent adversarial audit:
- DD: Sequential auditor model (single auditor per exploration)
- OD: Wave execution model (4 visual-first agents -> 8 programmatic agents -> 2 cross-OD agents -> 1 synthesizer)
- The wave model prevented most Playwright contention and produced higher cross-reference density (18 confirmed cross-references)

### Research Consumption (Transitive)

The org->density->axis transitive chain means AD inherits not just OD-F findings but the full accumulated research weight:
- R-1 findings consumed by OD (71%) flow through to AD as validated constraints
- DD-F findings consumed by OD (100%) flow through to AD with OD validation evidence
- EXT-* bespoke findings (~85%) provide targeted enrichment evidence
- R-2 findings (0% consumed) represent UNCONSUMED potential -- AD WARNING active

===============================================================================
## 7. ACCUMULATED RESEARCH WEIGHT
===============================================================================

| Research Stream | Total Findings | Consumed by OD | Application Rate |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| R-1 Documentation Patterns | 28 | 20 | ~71% |
| R-2 Creative Layouts | 27 | 0 | 0% (AD WARNING) |
| R-5 Combination Theory | 39 | 2 | ~5% (secondary role) |
| DD-F Outbound Findings | 18 | 18 | 100% |
| COMP-F Component Findings | 21 | 21 | 100% (inherited) |
| EXT-* Bespoke Research | 53 | ~45 | ~85% |
| **TOTAL** | **186** | **~106** | **~57%** |

**Key Insight (OD-F-PR-001):** Bespoke, targeted research (EXT-*) achieves ~85% consumption while pre-existing broad research (R-1) achieves only ~71%. R-2 at 0% confirms: research not specifically targeted to hypotheses is not consumed. Future stages should adopt the bespoke research model AND explicitly evaluate existing unconsumed streams.

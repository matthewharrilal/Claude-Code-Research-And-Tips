# HANDOFF: AD → CD
## CD Reads This FIRST at Phase 0

===============================================================================
## PURPOSE
===============================================================================

This document transfers everything CD needs from AD's completed state. AD
completed 4 phases: convention+research (Phase 0), 3-wave build with identity
loop (Phase 1), 24+-agent multi-dimensional audit (Phase 2), fix execution with
programmatic+visual verification (Phase 3), and synthesis+infrastructure (Phase 4).

The central discovery: **axis geometry IS density IS organization** — three names
for one phenomenon. The 3-way unification is VALIDATED through 5 distinct
equivalence mechanisms (temporal, spatial, proportional, kinetic, gravitational).
The meta-equivalence is ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (AD-F-023).

CD's mission: test whether COMBINATIONS of these validated patterns maintain
the equivalence or reveal new dynamics at the combination scale.

===============================================================================

## AXIS PATTERNS (6 Total, All VALIDATED / INCLUDE)
===============================================================================

| Pattern | AD | Score | Density Pairing | Key Discovery |
|---------|-----|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Z-PATTERN** | AD-001 | 36/40 | PULSE + TIDAL | Z-sweep IS PULSE beat. Width variation IS TIDAL. Temporal equivalence. |

===============================================================================
## GATE FINDING FOR CD
===============================================================================

**DD-F-012 was AD's gate finding.** It stated: "Density patterns imply axis preferences." AD validated this through 6 explorations and ELEVATED it: axis does not merely serve density — axis IS density expressed spatially.

**AD's gate finding for CD is DD-F-013:** "Component density tolerance — how much density variation can a single component absorb before it needs to split into multiple components." CD must answer this at the combination scale: when two axis patterns combine, do their components maintain density tolerance or require splitting?

Additionally, AD-F-024 (compound is sequential) and AD-F-025 (transition grammar) are MANDATORY constraints for CD. Any combination that violates the sequential principle or lacks transition grammar between zones is INVALID.

===============================================================================
## PRIMARY RESEARCH FOR CD
===============================================================================

**R-5 (Combination Theory)** is CD's primary research. AD consumed R-5 partially in the compound context (AD-006). CD must consume R-5 fully.

**R-4 (Axis Innovations)** remains secondary. CD may need axis-specific findings when implementing combination layouts.

**EXT-CD-* (Extended Research)** should be commissioned during Phase 0 for:
- Combination layout patterns
- Multi-axis co-existence strategies
- Transition grammar extensions
- Component density tolerance testing

===============================================================================
## 3-WAY UNIFICATION — WHAT CD INHERITS
===============================================================================

The transitive chain is now COMPLETE:

```
DD (Density) → OD (Organization) → AD (Axis)
     ↓              ↓                  ↓
  8 patterns    6 patterns         6 patterns
     ↓              ↓                  ↓
  DD-F-###      OD-F-###           AD-F-###
     ↓              ↓                  ↓
 "Visual rhythm"  "Cognitive rhythm" "Spatial rhythm"
                    ↓                  ↓
              OD-F-005: "org IS    AD-F-004: "axis IS
               density"              density IS org"
                                       ↓
                                 AD-F-023: "All are
                                  ATTENTION TOPOLOGY"
```

CD operates at the TOP of this chain. Every combination must maintain the
3-way equivalence. A combination that breaks the equivalence is INVALID.

===============================================================================
## SOUL COMPLIANCE
===============================================================================

5 soul pieces remain LOCKED. No 6th was discovered (AD-F-028 confirms).

| # | Soul Piece | AD Status |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | border-radius: 0 | 0 violations across 3,190 DOM elements |
| 2 | No filter: drop-shadow() | 0 violations |
| 3 | Instrument Serif + Inter + JetBrains Mono | Verified after document.fonts.ready |
| 4 | box-shadow: none | 0 violations (3 fixed during audit) |
| 5 | Muted earth palette | 0 off-palette colors |

CD must maintain 0 violations. The convention spec (AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md)
and template (AD-SOUL-TEMPLATE.html) can be reused as the base for CD's
locked layer.

===============================================================================
## ANTI-PATTERNS — WHAT AD CONFIRMED
===============================================================================

| Anti-Pattern | AD Compliance |
|-------------|---------------|
| Rounded corners | 0 violations |
| Drop shadows | 0 violations |
| 2px border epidemic (OD-F-AP-001) | 0 violations (1 caught and fixed during audit) |
| Traffic-light adjacency | Verified per DD-F-015 |
| Callout cacophony | Max 2 per section (DD-F-014) |
| Semi-transparent backgrounds | 0 rgba with alpha < 1.0 |

===============================================================================
## CONVENTION SPEC — AD'S CONTRIBUTION
===============================================================================

AD created AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (822 lines, 16 sections):
- Sections 1-11: INHERITED from OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md
- Sections 12-16: AD-SPECIFIC (axis grid systems, axis zone tokens, responsive behavior, soul-compliant transitions, accessibility)

CD should:
1. Inherit sections 1-16 from AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md
2. Add sections 17-20: CD-SPECIFIC (combination rules, transition grammar, component density tolerance, combination accessibility)

===============================================================================
## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR CD
===============================================================================

1. **Combination density tolerance:** When two axis patterns combine (e.g., Z-Pattern + Bento Grid), does the combined component absorb both density patterns or require splitting?
2. **Transition grammar scaling:** AD-F-025 validated grammar for transitions within a single compound page. Does the grammar hold when transitions occur between separate combined pages?
3. **Attention topology at combination scale:** AD-F-023 described attention topology for individual axis patterns. How do attention topologies compose when multiple patterns operate on the same page?
4. **Sequential vs parallel combinations:** AD-F-024 showed compound density is sequential. Are there combination patterns that genuinely operate in parallel?
5. **Fractal at combination scale:** DD-F-006 confirmed at 5 scales. Does combination create a 6th scale (meta-combination) or is 5 the hard limit?

1. WHY THIS EXISTS
This file — titled "THE KORTAI DESIGN MIND" — is the comprehensive
philosophical anchor document for the entire KORTAI design system. It is
not a style guide, not a token reference, and not a list of rules. It is
the operating manual that teaches a reader (human or AI agent) HOW TO
THINK the way the design system thinks, so they can make new decisions
consistent with prior ones even when those decisions were never explicitly
specified. Across 9 Parts and 109KB (2053 lines), it covers: why the
system is discovery-based rather than decision-based (Part I), the 5-stage
compounding research pipeline (Part II), the provenance chain with 7
structures and 2 traversals (Part III), the digestion protocol with 4
engagement levels (Part IV), the interception framework for external
knowledge with sub-agent paradigm (Part V), reproduction methodology
(Part VI), file structure as embodied knowledge (Part VII), the meta-
insight that this is a transferable design mind (Part VIII), and the
retroactive update bridge connecting philosophy to codebase (Part IX).

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
"Can a system absorb the REASONING behind design decisions well enough to
make NEW decisions that are consistent with the ones that came before —
even when those new decisions were never explicitly specified?"

3. STATUS
ACTIVE | LOCKED | DO NOT TOUCH — 109KB (2053 lines). Prepend-only header.
No modifications to existing content. This is the single most important
document in the design system — the philosophical nucleus.

4. SOUL ALIGNMENT
This file is the comprehensive philosophical narrative that TRANSLATES
the 5 soul pieces into reasoning, examples, and transferable understanding:
- SP#1 Sharp Edges (border-radius: 0) — Explained as "identity truth
  already encoded in the DNA," not a style choice. Traced through
  COMP-F-001 → DD-006 fractal self-similarity → page-level mirroring.
- SP#2 Archivist Speaks in Serif — Contextualized within typography
  hierarchy as editorial confidence, not decoration.
- SP#3 Callout Family DNA — Presented as structural consistency that
  enables differentiation through color alone.
- SP#4 Shadows Lie About Depth — Philosophically grounded in print
  heritage honesty vs fake 3D.
- SP#5 Squares Signal System — Connected to the broader sharp-edges
  identity at the element level (checkboxes, borders).
- The file bridges soul pieces to their causal chains: COMP findings →
  DD findings → OD findings (hypothetical) → AD → CD → migration.

6. MUST HONOR
| Constraint | Source | Consequence of Violation |
|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| OD-F-007/008/009 are HYPOTHETICAL | Internal caveat (this file) | Treating these as completed work misrepresents system state |
| Discovery-based, not decision-based | Core philosophy (Part I) | Framing soul pieces as arbitrary choices destroys provenance reasoning |
| 5-stage pipeline order (T1→DD→OD→AD→CD) | Part II | Breaking stage ordering invalidates compounding research model |
| Provenance chain = causal chain, not documentation | Part I, line ~161 | Reducing provenance to "nice documentation" misses the entire point |
| 4 engagement levels (Application→Understanding→Extension→Validation) | Part IV / CLAUDE.md | Skipping levels produces mechanical application without reasoning |
| 3 reading modes (First Read / Task Execution / Context Recovery) | How To Use section | Using wrong mode wastes time or produces shallow understanding |
| 7 provenance structures | Part III | Missing any structure breaks the living system metaphor |

7. WHAT BREAKS IF THIS CHANGES
- **DESIGN-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md** — Directly references README.md as
  "READ FIRST" mandatory prerequisite. If README.md philosophy changes,
  CLAUDE.md's framing becomes misaligned.
- **All OD/AD/CD work** — Any future stage work must absorb this document
  as part of its research gate. Changed philosophy = changed reasoning
  foundation for all downstream stages.
- **showcase/CLAUDE.md** — The refinement loop and research grounding
  process assume the philosophical framework documented here.
- **knowledge-architecture/** — Pipeline documentation references the
  5-stage model described in Part II.
- **Blast radius:** Potentially the entire design system. This is the
  philosophical root node. Changes here propagate to every file that
  depends on the reasoning framework.
- **Files directly affected:**
  - docs-spa/app/showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md
  - docs-spa/app/showcase/CLAUDE.md
  - docs-spa/app/showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/BACKBONE.md
  - docs-spa/app/showcase/knowledge-architecture/ (multiple files)
  - All future OD/AD/CD exploration work

8. CONSUMED BY
| Consumer | How It Uses This File |
|----------|----------------------|
| DESIGN-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md | Mandates this as first read; summarizes 9 Parts, 3 modes, 4 levels; gates all design system work behind absorbing this document |
| showcase/CLAUDE.md | References philosophical framework for research grounding and refinement loop processes |
| dependency-trace files | References for reachability analysis and relationship mapping |
| Any new agent session | Context Recovery mode (Mode 3) provides 5-10 minute reorientation path |
| Future OD/AD/CD stages | Must absorb as part of mandatory research gate before producing any exploration |

9. RESEARCH DEBT
- OD-F-007/008/009 are hypothetical examples used to illustrate the
  compounding pipeline. When actual OD work is completed, these examples
  should be validated or replaced with real finding IDs.
- Part IX (Retroactive Bridge) execution sequences are now partially
  implemented via Phase 2B inline sections (7 of 10 structures exist).
  Remaining: Question Generator formalization, HANDOFF documents for
  stages 3-5, CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT files.
- The interception framework (Part V) and sub-agent paradigm describe
  4 sub-agent types and 3 dimensions but these have not been exercised
  in production OD work yet.
- Reproduction methodology (Part VI) has not been tested by an
  independent team — it is theoretically sound but empirically unproven.

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
Q1: Does every finding ID referenced in this document (COMP-F-XXX,
    DD-F-XXX) trace back to a real, existing file in the provenance
    chain — and are OD-F-007/008/009 clearly marked as hypothetical?
Q2: Are the 5 soul pieces described here identical (in name, number,
    and meaning) to those in MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md?
Q3: Does the 5-stage pipeline described in Part II match the stage
    structure in BACKBONE.md and PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md?
Q4: Can a reader following Mode 3 (Context Recovery, 5-10 min path)
    successfully re-ground without reading the full 109KB?
Q5: Does DESIGN-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md's summary of this document accurately
    reflect the current content of all 9 Parts?

# HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

## This Document Has Three Modes

### Mode 1: FIRST READ (Philosophy → Understanding)
**You are:** New to KORTAI, need to understand the system
**Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Path:**
1. Read PART I (Philosophy) — Why does this system exist?
2. Read PART II (Pipeline) — What are the 5 stages?
3. Read PART III (Provenance Chain) — How do files connect?
4. Skim PART IV-VIII — Get a sense of operations
**After:** You understand the DESIGN-MIND. You're ready for specific tasks.

### Mode 2: TASK EXECUTION (Reference → Action)
**You are:** Building an exploration, need operational guidance
**Time:** 15-20 minutes per task
**Path by Task:**

| If You're Doing... | Start Here | Then Go To |
|--------------------|------------|------------|
| Building an OD exploration | PART IV: Digestion | RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-OD.md |
| Understanding why a pattern exists | PART III: Backward Traversal | Pattern's DERIVATION CHAIN |
| Figuring out what to consume | PART III: Forward Traversal | HANDOFF-[FROM]-TO-[TO].md |
| Deploying sub-agents | PART V: Interception | Sub-agent prompt templates |
| Creating retroactive updates | PART IX: Retroactive Bridge | Retroactive Update Checklist |

### Mode 3: CONTEXT RECOVERY (Reset → Reorientation)
**You are:** Returning after context loss, need to re-ground
**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Path:**
1. Read FOLDER-MAP.md — Understand codebase structure, find current phase
2. Read the **inline threading section** of your target file — Extract constraints, dependencies, blast radius
3. Read BACKBONE.md — Current state snapshot
4. Read this document's PART II — Refresh pipeline understanding
5. Read the specific PART for your current task
**After:** You're re-oriented and can continue work.

> **Why inline sections first?** The inline section of your target file tells you what it BUILT ON (what to read next), what it MUST HONOR (constraints), and what BREAKS IF CHANGED (blast radius). This is faster than reading the full provenance chain — the provenance is already summarized at the point of use.

# PART I — WHAT THIS DESIGN SYSTEM IS AND WHY IT'S DIFFERENT

## The Question This System Answers

Every design system answers one question: "what should things look like?"

This design system answers a different question: **can a system absorb the REASONING behind design decisions well enough to make NEW decisions that are consistent with the ones that came before — even when those new decisions were never explicitly specified?**

That question is the foundation of everything documented here. Every structural choice, every provenance chain, every CLAUDE.md file, every handoff note, every finding ID — all of it exists to answer that question with yes.

Because if the answer is no — if a system reading this can only mechanically apply "use CRESCENDO density for narrative content" — then the provenance chain is just elaborate documentation. Nice to have. Historically interesting. But functionally, you could have written the rules in a flat file and gotten the same result.

But if the answer is yes — if by structuring the research chain correctly, by making the journey visible, by showing not just WHAT was decided but HOW it was discovered and WHY it was validated — if a system can absorb all of that and then THINK at the same level when it encounters something the design system never explicitly covered...

Then this isn't a design system. It's a **transferable design mind**.

That's what we built. Not a collection of tokens and patterns. A body of knowledge structured so that absorbing it doesn't just give you rules — it gives you the capacity to reason the way the rules were reasoned.

## The Difference Between This and a Normal Design System

A design system built the normal way is a deliverable. Someone decides "the primary color is red, the border radius is 0, the font is Inter" and writes it down. The markdown file IS the design system. You read it, you apply it, you're done. The file is self-contained. It doesn't need anything else.

That's not what happened here.

What happened here is that nobody sat down and decided "the border radius is 0." Instead, we audited 11 real components that already existed in the KortAI codebase, and through that audit — through actually LOOKING at how KortAI's components already behaved — we discovered that sharp edges weren't a style choice. They were an identity truth already encoded in the DNA of the product. The codebase was TELLING us something about itself, and the audit was the act of listening.

That discovery — Soul Piece #1 — didn't come from a design brief. It came from perceptual auditing. It's empirical. It's extracted. And the markdown file that documents it (SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md) isn't the discovery itself. It's the RECORD of the discovery. The discovery happened during the component remediation process. The markdown file is evidence.

And then that evidence became fuel.

DD didn't just know "border radius is 0" as a rule to follow. DD consumed COMP-F-001 (the finding that sharp edges = authority = precision) as a validated input, and every DD exploration was built with that finding active — verified every iteration, not assumed. When DD-006 scored 36/40 on fractal self-similarity, part of why it scored that high is because the sharp edges at the page level mirrored the sharp edges at the component level mirrored the sharp edges at the element level. The fractal principle WORKED because the soul piece was consistent across scales.

That's not two markdown files sitting next to each other. That's a **CAUSAL CHAIN**. COMP-F-001 enabled DD-006's high score. DD-006's high score validated the fractal principle. The fractal principle became DD-F-006 (an outbound finding). DD-F-006 flows into OD's research gate as a mandatory input. OD will build explorations that apply fractal self-similarity to cognitive flow. If those OD explorations score well, that validates the principle AGAIN at a new level. And that validated principle becomes a constraint for AD, then CD, then migration.

The muscle, tissue, and blood is that causal chain — the compounding research pipeline where every stage consumes everything before it and generates new knowledge for everything after it. The chain doesn't just accumulate. It compounds.

## ⚠️ The Problem: Stored vs Transmitted

**"The findings were STORED, not TRANSMITTED."**

This single observation explains why provenance structures matter. Without transmission:

1. Which R-1 findings apply to which OD exploration? → **Unknown**
2. What constraints from DD must OD honor? → **Scattered**
3. What quality bar did DD establish? → **Not enforced**

The information was there. The TRANSMISSION wasn't.

### What Happens Without Transmission

Without transmission, **each stage is orphaned**. The consequence is imitation at scale without understanding. Findings exist, but connections don't — "sparse information" where knowledge should flow.

### What Transmission Solves

The shift: from "contains information" to "transmits constraints forward."

**BEFORE:** Files that contain information
**AFTER:** A system where every file:
- KNOWS its role
- CARRIES accumulated weight
- CONSTRAINS future work
- EXPLAINS its derivation

---

# PART II — HOW THE RESEARCH PIPELINE WORKS

## The Five Stages

The design system was built through a 5-stage research pipeline. Each stage has a specific focus, consumes specific inputs, and produces specific outputs. The critical principle is that **each stage consumes ALL outputs from ALL prior stages, plus its primary research document**. The input surface grows at every stage. By Stage 5, the research gate references findings from every previous stage.

### 📥 Research Activation: How Stages Consume Findings

Before each stage, a **Research Activation Table** maps which prior findings apply to which exploration:

| ID | Finding Summary | OD-001 | OD-002 | OD-003 | OD-004 | Activation Notes |
|----|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------------|
| R1-007 | Q&A format reduces cognitive load | ✓ | | | | Conversational = PULSE density |
| R1-015 | Task-based organization outperforms feature-based | | | ✓ | | Task clustering primary |
| DD-F-003 | ISLANDS: clusters surrounded by sparse space | | | ✓ | | Spacing between clusters |
| DD-F-006 | Fractal self-similarity at all scales | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ALL explorations — non-negotiable |

⬇️ After reading your column → Go to EXPLORATION-PROTOCOL-[PHASE].md

### ❓ Question Generator: Inherited Questions Per Stage

Questions don't disappear — they ACCUMULATE and FORWARD until answered:

| Question | Origin | Why Prior Stage Couldn't Answer | This Stage Must Explore In |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Does fractal apply COGNITIVELY? | DD-F-006 | DD only tested visual | ALL OD explorations |
| What density for DECISIONS? | R3-041 | DD didn't test decision content | OD-004 |

### Stage 1 — Components (Foundation)

**What it did:** Audited 11 KortAI components for soul compliance. Found 54% compliance — a 32% soul gap. Through remediation (globals.css fixes, token corrections, edge audits, typography audits, depth audits, shape audits), reached ~92% compliance and DISCOVERED 5 soul pieces.

**What it consumed:** The existing KortAI codebase. The 11 components as they existed. No prior research — this was the origin point.

**What it produced:**
- 5 soul pieces — non-negotiable identity truths extracted from the codebase:
  - **Soul #1: Sharp Edges** — border-radius: 0 everywhere. Precision and authority.
  - **Soul #2: Archivist Serif** — serif italic for wisdom content. Knowledge has weight.
  - **Soul #3: Family DNA / 2-Zone Callouts** — components share structural patterns.
  - **Soul #4: No Shadows** — flatness = honesty. No artificial depth.
  - **Soul #5: Squares Signal System** — square shapes indicate system-level elements.
- 8 component findings (COMP-F-001 through COMP-F-008)
- FOUNDATION-REMEDIATION-SYNTHESIS.md (the record of what was fixed and why)
- The quality methodology: perceptual auditing discovers truths that technical auditing misses

**⬇️ Forward:** Soul pieces and COMP-F findings flow to DD and ALL future stages as mandatory constraints.

**Why it matters:** Everything after this stage stands on what Stage 1 discovered. The soul pieces are not design choices. They are empirical extractions. They constrain every future stage — not because someone decided they should, but because the codebase itself established them as identity truths.

### Stage 2 — Density (DD)

**What it did:** Built and tested 6 density explorations, each implementing a different visual rhythm pattern. Scored through the /perceptual-deepening skill. All 6 achieved INCLUDE status (avg 34.5/40), establishing the quality bar.

**What it consumed:** ALL of Stage 1's output (soul pieces verified every iteration, component findings as active constraints), plus R-3 Density Dimensions research (76% application rate).

**What it produced:**
- 6 validated density patterns:
  - PULSE (breathing rhythm) — DD-001, 33/40
  - CRESCENDO (sparse→dense) — DD-002, 35/40
  - ISLANDS (density clusters) — DD-003, 32/40
  - GEOLOGICAL (strata layers) — DD-004, 35/40
  - TIDAL (river flow) — DD-005, 36/40
  - FRACTAL (self-similarity) — DD-006, 36/40 ★★ BEST
- 12+ DD outbound findings (DD-F-001 through DD-F-[N]) — insights generated DURING DD that apply to OD, AD, CD, and migration
- The quality bar: 34.5/40 average. Future stages must meet this.
- DD-001/003 scored lowest — those iteration lessons carry forward

**⬇️ Forward:** Density patterns become CONSTRAINTS for OD. DD-F findings are MANDATORY consumption for OD.

**Why it matters:** DD proved that the soul pieces work under pressure. Sharp edges at every scale (fractal) produced the highest scores. This validated the soul pieces as UNIVERSAL principles, not just component-level rules. DD also established that density is a CONSTRAINT for all future stages — organizational patterns, axis patterns, and combination patterns all operate within the density vocabulary established here.

### Stage 3 — Organization (OD) — IN PROGRESS

**What it will do:** Build 6 organizational explorations testing how information should be sequenced, grouped, and cognitively navigated. Patterns like CONVERSATIONAL, NARRATIVE ARC, TASK-BASED, CONFIDENCE-BASED, SPATIAL/MAP, CREATIVE.

**What it consumes:** ALL of Stage 1's output (soul pieces, component findings), ALL of Stage 2's output (density patterns AS CONSTRAINTS — you don't choose a density pattern during OD, you build WITHIN the density vocabulary already established), ALL DD outbound findings, plus R-1 Documentation Patterns (PRIMARY — this is where R-1's 337 findings finally get applied after being <3% utilized through DD).

**⬇️ Forward:** OD findings flow to AD and CD. Questions OD can't answer forward to AD.

**What it will produce:** 6 validated organizational patterns, OD outbound findings, HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md, and the critical insight of how cognitive flow interacts with density.

### Stage 4 — Axis (AD) — FUTURE

**What it will consume:** ALL prior stages' output + R-2 Creative Layouts + R-4 Axis Innovations

**What it will produce:** Spatial layout geometry patterns, axis outbound findings

### Stage 5 — Combination (CD) — FUTURE

**What it will consume:** ALL prior stages' output + R-5 Combination Theory

**What it will produce:** Component interaction patterns, the final pattern vocabulary

## How Research Compounds

This compounding is what makes this design system different from one that was decided top-down. Each stage doesn't just pass one thing forward. It passes forward EVERYTHING it received plus EVERYTHING it generated.

Stage 1 produced 5 soul pieces and 8 findings.
Stage 2 consumed all 13 of those, plus R-3, and produced 6 patterns and 12+ findings.
Stage 3 consumes all 31+ of those, plus R-1, and will produce patterns and findings.
By Stage 5, the research gate will reference 100+ findings across all stages.

This is why the provenance chain matters. Without it, Stage 5 would only know its immediate predecessor (CD inherits from AD). With it, Stage 5 can trace ANY finding back through the entire pipeline to its origin. The chain makes the compounding VISIBLE and NAVIGABLE.

## The Soul Pieces — Constants Across All Stages

The 5 soul pieces are verified at EVERY iteration of EVERY exploration in EVERY stage. They are not optional. They are not suggestions. They are the identity DNA of KortAI, extracted empirically from the codebase.

When reading any exploration, any pattern, any component: the soul pieces must be ACTIVE, not just technically present. "Border-radius: 0" as a rule is just compliance. "Border-radius: 0 because sharpness communicates precision and authority, and that precision is consistent from the page level through the section level through the component level through the element level" — that's the soul piece being ACTIVE.

The difference matters for extension. When building something the design system doesn't explicitly cover, the soul pieces are the primary constraint. Not "set border-radius to 0" but "does this feel precise? Does it communicate authority? Does the sharpness serve the identity, or is it just technically compliant?" Those questions can only be asked if you understand the soul piece's MEANING, not just its value.

# PART III — THE PROVENANCE CHAIN: MUSCLE, BLOOD, AND TISSUE

## What the Provenance Chain Is

The provenance chain is the physical embodiment — in folders, files, and headers — of the causal connections between every stage, finding, pattern, and decision in the design system.

It lives in `showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/` and is organized by pipeline stage:

```
provenance/
├── PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md          ← Every finding with full lifecycle
├── RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md            ← Cumulative application tracking
├── SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md           ← Soul pieces across all stages
├── original-research/            ← R-1→R-5 source documents
├── stage-1-components/           ← What Stage 1 consumed and produced
├── stage-2-density-dd/           ← What Stage 2 consumed and produced
├── stage-3-organization-od/      ← What Stage 3 consumed and produced
├── stage-4-axis-ad/              ← What Stage 4 consumed and produced
└── stage-5-combination-cd/       ← What Stage 5 consumed and produced
```

Each stage folder contains:
- **STAGE-HEADER.md** — what the stage did, what it consumed (with file paths), what it produced
- **[PHASE]-outbound-findings.md** — what this stage learned FOR future stages (the cross-domain insights that aren't just about this stage's focus)
- **HANDOFF-[FROM]-TO-[TO].md** — the bridge document listing mandatory inputs for the next stage
- **Synthesis and gate files** — the research gate that mapped findings to explorations, and the synthesis of results

## Why It Exists — The Problem of Invisible Connections

Without the provenance chain, the design system is a collection of conclusions. "Use CRESCENDO density." "Border radius is 0." "Organize by narrative arc." These are answers with no journey. A reader can apply them mechanically, but they can't THINK with them. They can't make decisions the system didn't explicitly cover, because they never absorbed the reasoning that generated the decisions.

The files existed before the provenance chain. SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md existed. DD-REAUDIT-PERCEPTUAL-SYNTHESIS.md existed. density-patterns.md existed. They were all correct. They were all well-written. But they were disconnected. A new Claude opening the repo didn't know that the synthesis file CAUSED the pattern file. Didn't know that the soul discoveries ENABLED the density explorations. Didn't know that DD's outbound findings are MANDATORY inputs for OD, not optional reading. It saw files. Not a pipeline. Not a journey. Not a compounding chain of validated research.

The provenance chain makes the connection VISIBLE — not in prose, not in a narrative document you have to read end-to-end, but in the FILE STRUCTURE ITSELF. Moving through the folder system is moving through the research pipeline. The structure IS the chain.

---

## 🔨 THE SEVEN STRUCTURES

The provenance chain operates through seven concrete structures. Each has an exact format. Each serves a specific transmission purpose.

> ### How Inline Sections Embody the Seven Structures
>
> As of Phase 2B (2026-02-06), 253 files have **inline threading sections** that EMBODY the seven structures described below. Rather than creating separate provenance files, the provenance is embedded IN each file.
>
> **What this means for you:**
> - To find **Research Activation:** Read the BUILT ON table in your target file's inline section
> - To trace **Derivation:** Follow the BUILT ON chain backward through inline sections

### Structure 1: Research Activation Table

📥 **CONSUME BEFORE BUILDING**

**Purpose:** Maps findings → specific explorations (Forward Traversal)

```markdown
# 📥 RESEARCH ACTIVATION: [PHASE] Phase

## 🚀 How To Use This Table
1. Find your exploration column (OD-001, OD-002, etc.)
2. Every ✓ mark = a finding you MUST read before building
3. Read the finding, then build
4. After building, create your CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT proving you used these

## The Activation Matrix

| ID | Finding Summary | OD-001 | OD-002 | OD-003 | OD-004 | Activation Notes |
|----|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------------|
| R1-007 | Q&A format reduces cognitive load | ✓ | | | | Conversational = PULSE density |
| R1-015 | Task-based organization outperforms feature-based | | | ✓ | | Task clustering primary |
| R1-022 | Proximity > borders for grouping | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Challenged by OD-F-009 |
| DD-F-003 | ISLANDS: clusters surrounded by sparse space | | | ✓ | | Spacing between clusters |
| DD-F-006 | Fractal self-similarity at all scales | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ALL explorations — non-negotiable |
| DD-F-012 | Dense zones need breathing room | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | Rhythm management |

## ⬇️ After Reading Your Column
→ Go to EXPLORATION-PROTOCOL-[PHASE].md
→ Your research questions are now DEFINED by what you just read

## What Breaks If This Table Doesn't Exist
- Explorations built without consuming relevant research
- Research stays STORED, never ACTIVATED
- Each exploration reinvents questions that research already answered
- No way to verify "did they actually read the research?"
```

**RETROACTIVE UPDATE:** Create RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-DD.md, RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-OD.md

### Structure 2: Derivation Chain

⬆️ **TRACE BACKWARD TO ORIGIN**

**Purpose:** Shows why patterns exist (Backward Traversal)

```markdown
## ⬆️ DERIVATION CHAIN: Read Backward to Origin

### Why This Pattern Exists

CRESCENDO (progressive density builds)
    ↑
    scored 35/40 in DD-002 exploration
    ↑
    built on R3-015: "Progressive information density reduces cognitive overload"
    ↑
    cited: Miller's Law (7±2 chunks), Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory
    ↑
    constrained by: COMP-F-001 (sharp edges), COMP-F-004 (no shadows)

### What Breaks If You Change It

| If You... | This Breaks | Evidence | Severity |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Start dense instead of sparse | Reader overwhelm, 40% drop in completion | DD-002 iteration 3 | CRITICAL |
| Use shadows for density zones | Violates COMP-F-004, soul piece breach | Soul piece audit | CRITICAL |
| Skip middle density | Jarring transition, loses narrative | DD-002 iteration 5 | HIGH |
| Reverse direction (dense→sparse) | Ending feels empty, not resolved | DD-002 iteration 2 | MEDIUM |

### ⬇️ Forward Dependencies: What Consumes This Pattern

| Consumer | How It Uses CRESCENDO | Constraint Imposed |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| OD-002 (Narrative) | Pairs with CRESCENDO for story flow | Must maintain sparse→dense |
| OD-004 (Confidence) | Uses CRESCENDO for progressive certainty | Confidence builds with density |
| AD-002 (Axis for Narrative) | Axis must accommodate density progression | Vertical space allocation |

### What Breaks If This Section Doesn't Exist
- Patterns are conclusions without journey
- No way to understand WHY a pattern exists
- No way to know what breaks if changed
- Future work can accidentally violate the logic
```

**RETROACTIVE UPDATE:** Add DERIVATION CHAIN section to every pattern

### Structure 3: Exploration Protocol

🔨 **BUILD WITH RESEARCH ACTIVE**

**Purpose:** Research invokes exploration questions (Forward Traversal)

```markdown
# 🔨 EXPLORATION PROTOCOL: [PHASE] Phase

## 🚀 START HERE: Before Building ANY Exploration

### Step 1: Load Your Research Activation (5 min)
📥 Open: `RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-[PHASE].md`
📥 Find: Your exploration's column
📥 Read: EVERY finding marked with ✓
📥 Verify: You understand WHY each finding applies to your exploration

### Step 2: Load Your Density Constraint (2 min)
Every OD exploration pairs with a DD density pattern:

| OD Exploration | Paired Density | Constraint Implication |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| OD-001 Conversational | PULSE | Alternate high-low information rhythm |
| OD-002 Narrative | CRESCENDO | Build sparse → dense progressively |
| OD-003 Task-Based | ISLANDS | Clusters surrounded by clear space |
| OD-004 Confidence | GEOLOGICAL | Layered depth, surface → deep |

⚠️ You CANNOT choose a different density. The pairing is fixed.

### Step 3: Load Your Soul Constraints (1 min)
All 5 soul pieces verified EVERY iteration. No exceptions.
- #1 Sharp Edges (border-radius: 0)
- #2 Archivist Serif (Cormorant Garamond for wisdom display)
- #3 2-Zone Callout (family structure header/body)
- #4 No Shadows (light as information, not decoration)
- #5 Squares (square indicators, not circles)

### Step 4: Define Your Exploration Questions (10 min)
Your exploration ANSWERS these research-derived questions through building:

For OD-003 (Task-Based), the research tells you to explore:
- From R1-015: How does task-based organization manifest visually?
- From DD-F-003: How much space between task clusters?
- From DD-F-006: Do task groups at page level mirror section level (fractal)?

⚠️ You don't invent questions. Research GIVES you questions. Building ANSWERS them.

---

## 🔨 DURING BUILDING

### Iteration Requirements
- **Minimum:** 5 iterations
- **Maximum:** No limit (until ≥32/40 score)
- **Rule:** One change per iteration (isolated variable)
- **Audit:** Run `/perceptual-deepening` EVERY iteration
- **Document:** Discoveries become [PHASE]-F-### findings

### Per-Iteration Checklist
- [ ] Soul pieces verified (all 5)
- [ ] Density pattern maintained
- [ ] Research questions addressed
- [ ] Score recorded
- [ ] Discoveries documented

---

## 📤 AFTER BUILDING

### Step 5: Run Reflection Protocol
→ Go to REFLECTION-PROTOCOL.md
→ Document: What was VALIDATED? CHALLENGED? What NEW questions emerged?

### Step 6: Create Consumption Receipt
→ Create CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT-[EXPLORATION].md
→ Prove: What you consumed, how you applied it, what you produced

### Step 7: Generate Outbound Findings

| Finding ID | What Discovered | Mandatory For | Recommended For |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| OD-F-007 | 48px minimum cluster gap | AD-003 | AD-001 |
| OD-F-008 | 3-level max task hierarchy | CD task components | CD all |
| OD-F-009 | >5 item clusters need hairline borders | AD border decisions | — |

---

## What Breaks If This Protocol Doesn't Exist
- Exploration is "build something and see" instead of "answer accumulated research questions"
- No inherited density constraint — random visual decisions
- No soul verification — violations creep in
- No outbound findings — learnings don't flow forward
- Exploration is isolated, not part of the chain
```

**RETROACTIVE UPDATE:** Create EXPLORATION-PROTOCOL-OD.md

---

### Structure 4: Consumption Receipt

📋 **PROVE FINDINGS WERE USED**

**Purpose:** Proves findings were actually used (Both Forward and Backward Traversal)

```markdown
# 📋 CONSUMPTION RECEIPT: [EXPLORATION-ID]

**Exploration:** OD-003 (Task-Based Organization)
**Final Score:** 34/40
**Decision:** INCLUDE
**Date Completed:** [DATE]

---

## 📥 WHAT I CONSUMED

### From Original Research (R-1 through R-5)
| Finding ID | Finding Summary | How I Applied It | Evidence Location |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| R1-015 | Task-based org outperforms feature-based | Used task clusters as primary structure | Lines 45-120, main grid |
| R1-022 | Proximity > borders for grouping | Grouped tasks by whitespace | Lines 60-90, task groups |
| R3-027 | Dense content needs breathing room | Added 24px padding around dense areas | Lines 100-140, callouts |

### From DD Findings
| Finding ID | Finding Summary | How I Applied It | Evidence Location |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| DD-F-003 | ISLANDS density pattern | Created task clusters as visual islands | Full page structure |
| DD-F-006 | Fractal self-similarity | Page→section→component mirrors | Verified at all 3 levels |
| DD-F-012 | Breathing room at density transitions | 48px gaps between task clusters | Lines 45, 90, 135 |

### Soul Pieces Verified (All 5 Required)
| Piece | What I Checked | Result | Evidence |
|-------|---------------|--------|----------|
| #1 Sharp Edges | border-radius: 0 everywhere | ✅ PASS | CSS lines 12, 34, 56 |

| #4 No Shadows | box-shadow: none everywhere | ✅ PASS | CSS audit complete |
| #5 Squares | Square indicators, not circles | ✅ PASS | Icon audit complete |

---

## 📤 WHAT I PRODUCED

### New Findings Generated
| Finding ID | What I Discovered | Mandatory For | Recommended For | Confidence |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| OD-F-007 | 48px minimum cluster gap | AD-003 | AD-001, AD-002 | HIGH (tested 3 values) |
| OD-F-008 | 3-level max task hierarchy | CD task components | CD all | HIGH (deeper failed) |
| OD-F-009 | >5 item clusters need hairline borders | AD border decisions | — | MEDIUM (partially challenges R1-022) |

### Questions I Couldn't Answer (→ Forwarded to AD)
| Question | Why I Couldn't Answer | Forwarded To |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Optimal axis geometry for task display? | OD doesn't isolate axis | AD-003 |
| Horizontal vs vertical task lists? | Would need axis-focused exploration | AD-003 |

---

## 📊 RESEARCH STATUS UPDATES

| Finding ID | Status Before | Status After | Notes |
|------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| R1-015 | PENDING | ✅ APPLIED | Successfully validated |
| R1-022 | PENDING | ⚠️ PARTIALLY CHALLENGED | See OD-F-009 |
| DD-F-003 | AVAILABLE | ✅ CONSUMED | ISLANDS works for tasks |
| DD-F-006 | AVAILABLE | ✅ CONSUMED | Fractal verified at all scales |

---

## What Breaks If This Receipt Doesn't Exist
- No proof that findings were actually consumed (just claimed)
- Research lifecycle is invisible — can't track PENDING → APPLIED
- No evidence locations — can't verify claims
- Questions don't forward — get lost between stages
- Future stages can't trust what was "consumed"
```

**RETROACTIVE UPDATE:** Create CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT for DD-001 through DD-006

---

### Structure 5: Question Generator

❓ **INHERITED QUESTIONS PER STAGE**

**Purpose:** Accumulated questions per stage (Forward Traversal)

```markdown
# ❓ QUESTIONS BY STAGE

Questions don't disappear — they ACCUMULATE and FORWARD until answered.

---

## Stage 2 (DD) → Stage 3 (OD): Questions DD Couldn't Answer

DD explored VISUAL density. These questions require COGNITIVE exploration:

| Question | Origin | Why DD Couldn't Answer | OD Must Explore In | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Does fractal self-similarity apply COGNITIVELY, not just visually? | DD-F-006 | DD only tested visual hierarchy | ALL OD explorations | HIGH |
| How does information density interact with READING ORDER? | DD-005 observation | DD tested static layouts, not flow | OD-001, OD-002 | HIGH |
| What density pattern best supports DECISION-MAKING? | R3-041 | DD didn't build decision-focused content | OD-004 | MEDIUM |
| Does PULSE rhythm work for dialogue? | DD-001 result | DD tested monologue, not dialogue | OD-001 | MEDIUM |
| How does CRESCENDO interact with story resolution? | DD-002 result | DD didn't test narrative arc | OD-002 | MEDIUM |

---

## Stage 3 (OD) → Stage 4 (AD): Questions OD Won't Answer

OD explores ORGANIZATIONAL patterns. These questions require AXIS exploration:

| Question | Origin | Why OD Can't Answer | AD Must Explore In | Priority |
|----------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| What axis geometry serves progressive disclosure? | OD-002 reflection | OD doesn't isolate axis | AD-002 | HIGH |
| Horizontal vs vertical for task completion flows? | OD-003 reflection | Would require axis-focused build | AD-003 | HIGH |
| How does axis interact with 48px gap requirement? | OD-F-007 (new) | Spacing finding, not axis finding | AD-003 | HIGH |
| Does radial axis work for confidence display? | OD-004 observation | Radial not tested | AD-004 | MEDIUM |

---

## ⚠️ RESEARCH DEBT (Open Questions — Nobody Owns Yet)

These questions are ACKNOWLEDGED but not assigned. They represent risk.

| Question | Origin | What Breaks If Ignored | Risk Level | Assigned To |
|----------|--------|----------------------|------------|-------------|
| Mobile density thresholds? | R3-027 | Mobile layouts may fail | HIGH | UNASSIGNED |
| Accessibility at high density? | R3-044 | WCAG violations possible | HIGH | UNASSIGNED |
| Animation timing in density transitions? | DD observation | Transitions may feel jarring | MEDIUM | UNASSIGNED |
| RTL language support for axis patterns? | General | RTL users excluded | MEDIUM | UNASSIGNED |

### Debt Assignment Protocol
When a question is assigned:
1. Move from DEBT to appropriate stage section
2. Update "Assigned To" column
3. Add to that stage's RESEARCH-ACTIVATION table

---

## What Breaks If This Section Doesn't Exist
- Each stage invents its own questions instead of inheriting
- Research debt is invisible — nobody knows what's NOT being addressed
- Questions get lost in transitions between stages
- Same questions get "discovered" repeatedly
- No accountability for what's NOT been explored
```

**RETROACTIVE UPDATE:** Add QUESTIONS section to PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md

---

### Structure 6: Reflection Protocol

🔍 **EXTRACT LEARNINGS POST-EXPLORATION**

**Purpose:** Extracts learnings post-exploration (Both Forward and Backward Traversal)

```markdown
# 🔍 REFLECTION PROTOCOL

## 🚪 GATE: Run This After Exploration Scores ≥32/40

If score is <32/40, continue iterating. Do not reflect yet.

---

## Part 1: What Did We Learn?

### Research VALIDATED ✅
Findings that our exploration CONFIRMED:

| Finding ID | Original Claim | What We Found | Confidence Change |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| R1-015 | Task-based > feature-based organization | Users found content 34% faster with task clusters | +20% confidence |
| DD-F-003 | ISLANDS density works for clustering | Clustering worked at tested spacing | +15% confidence |
| DD-F-006 | Fractal self-similarity at all scales | Page→section→component mirrors all worked | +10% confidence |

### Research CHALLENGED ⚠️
Findings that our exploration QUESTIONED or MODIFIED:

| Finding ID | Original Claim | What We Found | Becomes New Finding |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| R1-022 | Proximity > borders for all grouping | Some task clusters with >5 items needed borders | OD-F-009 |

**OD-F-009:** "Task clusters with >5 items benefit from hairline borders (0.5px, subtle) to maintain visual grouping. This PARTIALLY CHALLENGES R1-022 for large clusters."

### NEW Questions ❓
Questions that EMERGED from this exploration (not inherited):

| Question | How It Emerged | Forward To |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Does task completion ORDER affect ideal organization? | Noticed users scan differently based on urgency | AD-003 or CD |
| How do NESTED tasks interact with fractal principle? | 3-level hierarchy worked; what about 4+? | CD task components |
| Should task progress indicators use density? | Some tasks feel "heavier" when complete | Future research |

---

## Part 2: What Flows Forward?

### Findings That Other Stages MUST Consume

| Finding ID | Mandatory For | Why Mandatory | Recommended For |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| OD-F-007 | AD-003 | Axis must accommodate 48px gaps | AD-001, AD-002 |
| OD-F-008 | CD task components | Component must support exactly 3 levels | CD all |
| OD-F-009 | AD border decisions | AD needs to know when borders apply | — |

### Constraints That Remain Active
These DD constraints were NOT "used up" — they still apply to future stages:

| Constraint | Still Applies To | Why |
|------------|-----------------|-----|
| DD-F-006 (fractal) | AD, CD | Fractal is universal, not stage-specific |
| COMP-F-001-008 (soul pieces) | ALL | Soul pieces never expire |

---

## Part 3: What Would We Do Differently?

### Iteration Lessons
| Iteration | What Happened | Lesson for Future |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Iteration 2 | Tested 3 layouts simultaneously | Test ONE variable at a time |
| Iteration 4 | Almost violated soul piece #3 (2-zone callout) | Check soul pieces BEFORE finalizing |
| Iteration 5 | Realized ISLANDS needed more space than DD-003 | Read DD findings MORE carefully |

### Process Lessons
- Started with wrong question — should have asked "what tasks do users bring?" first
- Perceptual deepening in iteration 3 caught issues iteration 2 missed
- Final score (34/40) could have been 36+ if we'd started with better task inventory

---

## Part 4: Update The Chain

### Mandatory Updates (Do ALL Before Marking Complete)

- [ ] **RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md** → Mark consumed findings as APPLIED
- [ ] **PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md** → Add new findings (OD-F-007, OD-F-008, OD-F-009)
- [ ] **QUESTIONS section** → Add forwarded questions for AD
- [ ] **CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT** → Create for this exploration
- [ ] **DD-outbound-findings.md** → Mark which DD findings were consumed
- [ ] **HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md** → Add mandatory findings for AD

### Optional Updates (If Applicable)

- [ ] **SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md** → Add if new soul piece candidates emerged
- [ ] **RESEARCH-DEBT** → Add if new debt questions identified
- [ ] **density-patterns.md** → Update if density insights refined

---

## What Breaks If This Protocol Doesn't Exist
- Learnings stay in someone's head — chain doesn't grow
- Research never gets marked VALIDATED or CHALLENGED
- New findings don't flow forward — AD won't know about OD-F-007
- Questions get lost — nobody knows what OD couldn't answer
- Same mistakes repeated — no iteration lessons captured
```

**RETROACTIVE UPDATE:** Run REFLECTION-PROTOCOL retroactively on DD-001 through DD-006

---

### Structure 7: Identity Signature

🪪 **FOLDER PERSONALITY AND ROLE**

**Purpose:** Folder personality and role (Both Forward and Backward Traversal)

```markdown
## 🪪 IDENTITY SIGNATURE

Every folder has a PERSONALITY. This is mine.

---

### I Am
The **rhythm muscles** of the design system. I explored how information density creates visual and cognitive rhythm. My 6 explorations tested 6 different density patterns, establishing the vocabulary of PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL, and FRACTAL.

### I Carry Forward
I inherited and still carry:
- **5 Soul Pieces** (from Stage 1 Component Audits)
  - These constrain ALL my work, always
- **8 Component Findings** (COMP-F-001 through COMP-F-008)
  - These define what components CAN'T do
- **Quality bar expectation** of 32/40 minimum
  - Established by Stage 1 component audits

### I Produced
Through my explorations, I created:
- **6 Density Patterns:** PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL, FRACTAL
- **18 Findings:** DD-F-001 through DD-F-018
- **Quality Evidence:** Average score 34.5/40 across all 6 explorations
- **One Meta-Pattern:** DD-F-006 (fractal) applies to ALL future work

### I Constrain
Future stages MUST honor:
| Constraint | Applies To | Consequence If Violated |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| DD-F-006 (fractal self-similarity) | ALL future explorations | Soul piece violation equivalent |
| Density pairings (OD-001→PULSE, etc.) | OD stage specifically | Organizational patterns will feel arbitrary |
| 34.5/40 quality bar | ALL future explorations | Below this suggests insufficient iteration |
| No shadows for density (COMP-F-004) | ALL density implementations | Light must signal information, not decoration |

### If I Didn't Exist
- OD would choose density patterns arbitrarily (why PULSE for conversational? unknown)
- No quality bar would exist — what score is "good enough"?
- No fractal constraint — patterns at different scales wouldn't match
- No density vocabulary — how would teams discuss rhythm?

### My Strongest
**DD-F-006 (Fractal self-similarity)** scored 36/40 — highest of any DD finding.
This discovery elevated from "pattern" to "meta-pattern" status. It's now a soul-level constraint.

### My Weakest
**DD-001 (PULSE) and DD-003 (ISLANDS)** scored lowest (32-33/40).
Lesson: Rhythm-based patterns (PULSE) and spatial patterns (ISLANDS) need more iteration. OD should be careful when pairing with these.

---

### What Breaks If This Signature Doesn't Exist
- Folders are containers, not actors — they don't know their role
- No way to answer "what does DD constrain?"
- No inheritance visibility — what did DD receive? what did it produce?
- No quality expectations — how do I know if my work is "DD-quality"?
- No strengths/weaknesses — future stages can't learn from my experience
```

**RETROACTIVE UPDATE:** Add IDENTITY SIGNATURE to every CLAUDE.md

---

## ⬆️ BACKWARD TRAVERSAL: "Why Does This Exist?"

### Use Case
Someone sees a finding and asks WHY. They need to trace backward to origin.

### Complete Example: OD-F-007

```
OD-F-007: "Task clusters need 48px minimum gap"
    │
    └─→ WHERE did this number come from?
        │
        ├─→ OD-003 Exploration (scored 34/40)
        │   │
        │   └─→ Iterations 3-5 tested: 24px, 32px, 48px gaps
        │       │
        │       └─→ Result: 48px produced best task completion times
        │           Users found tasks 34% faster with 48px vs 24px
        │           Smaller gaps caused "cluster bleed" — visual confusion
        │
        ├─→ BUILT ON: DD-F-003 (ISLANDS density pattern)
        │   │
        │   ├─→ DD-003 established: "clusters surrounded by sparse space"
        │   │   BUT didn't specify HOW MUCH space — that was OD's job
        │   │
        │   └─→ DD-F-003 BUILT ON: R3-018
        │       │
        │       └─→ R3-018: "Gestalt proximity requires clear boundaries"
        │           Cited: Wertheimer's Gestalt Principles (1923)
        │
        └─→ BUILT ON: R1-015 (Original Research)
            │
            └─→ Research said: "Task-based organization outperforms feature-based"
                │
                └─→ CITED: Information Foraging Theory (Pirolli & Card, 1999)
                    "Users forage for information like animals forage for food —
                     clear patches with clear paths between them"
                    │
                    └─→ This is the ORIGIN. We can't go further back.
```

### What Enables This Traversal

For this backward path to work, these fields MUST exist:

| Document | Required Field | Example Value | If Missing |
|----------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| OD-F-007 in PIPELINE-MANIFEST | `source:` | OD-003 | Can't find which exploration created it |
| OD-F-007 in PIPELINE-MANIFEST | `built_on:` | DD-F-003, R1-015 | Can't trace to prior findings |
| OD-003 CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT | `consumed:` section | DD-F-003, R1-015 | No proof of consumption |
| DD-F-003 in density-patterns.md | DERIVATION CHAIN section | Shows R3-018 origin | Pattern is a conclusion without journey |
| R1-015 in research findings | `cited:` | Information Foraging Theory | Research has no external grounding |
| PIPELINE-MANIFEST | Lifecycle tracking | All findings with status | Can't see where finding is in journey |

### What Breaks If Backward Traversal Doesn't Work
- Findings are CONCLUSIONS without JOURNEY
- No way to understand WHY something is 48px and not 32px
- No way to know what BREAKS if you change 48px
- Can't defend decisions — "we just tried it and it worked" is not sufficient
- Future stages can't learn from the reasoning, only copy the answer

## ⬇️ FORWARD TRAVERSAL: "What Must I Consume Before Building?"

### Use Case
You're about to build an exploration. What should you know first?

### Complete Example: AD-003 (Axis Geometry for Task-Based)

```
AD-003: Axis Geometry for Task-Based Layouts
    │
    └─→ WHAT must I consume before building?
        │
        │
        ├─→ BRANCH 1: OD Findings (MANDATORY — from immediately prior stage)
        │   │
        │   │   These findings came from OD-003 which explored the same topic.
        │   │   They are MANDATORY — AD-003 MUST consume them.
        │   │
        │   ├─→ OD-F-007: "48px minimum cluster gap"
        │   │   │
        │   │   └─→ Your axis geometry must ACCOMMODATE this spacing
        │   │       Grid lines, gutters, margins must work with 48px
        │   │
        │   ├─→ OD-F-008: "3-level max task hierarchy"
        │   │   │
        │   │   └─→ Your axis must support EXACTLY 3 levels, no more
        │   │       Vertical divisions should assume 3 levels max
        │   │
        │   └─→ OD-F-009: ">5 item clusters need hairline borders"
        │       │
        │       └─→ Your axis intersections may need border accommodation
        │           Where axis lines meet borders, ensure no visual collision
        │
        │
        ├─→ BRANCH 2: DD Constraints (STILL ACTIVE — from earlier stage)
        │   │
        │   │   These constraints from DD still apply — they weren't "used up" by OD.
        │   │   DD constraints PERSIST through all future stages.
        │   │
        │   ├─→ DD-F-003: "ISLANDS density pattern"
        │   │   │
        │   │   └─→ Task clusters are ISLANDS — your axis creates the "sea" between
        │   │       Axis spacing IS the sparse space around clusters

### What Enables This Traversal

For this forward path to work, these documents MUST exist:

| Document | Required Content | Purpose | If Missing |
|----------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-AD.md | AD-003 column with ✓ marks | Shows which findings to read before AD-003 | Builder doesn't know what to read |
| HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md | MANDATORY section listing OD-F-007, OD-F-008, OD-F-009 | Explicitly states what AD MUST honor | OD findings get ignored |
| PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md QUESTIONS section | Questions forwarded from DD, OD | Shows what AD-003 must answer | Builder invents own questions |
| stage-3-od/CLAUDE.md IDENTITY SIGNATURE | "I constrain: AD must honor..." | States what OD constrains | No inheritance visibility |
| DD density-patterns.md | DD-F-003, DD-F-006 with DERIVATION CHAINS | Constraints that persist | DD constraints forgotten |

### What Breaks If Forward Traversal Doesn't Work
- Builder doesn't know what to consume before starting
- OD findings get ignored by AD (OD-F-007's 48px forgotten)
- DD constraints decay over time (DD-F-006 fractal ignored by stage 4)
- Questions get re-invented instead of inherited
- Each stage starts fresh instead of building on prior work

## The Living System: Metaphors Made Concrete

### Why Metaphors Matter
The provenance chain isn't a filing system. It's a LIVING ORGANISM.
Each part has a role. Understanding the metaphor helps you understand WHAT BREAKS when parts are missing.

### The Five Organs

| Organ | Concrete Structure | Function | What DIES If Missing |
|-------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|
| **BLOOD** | Findings flowing: R-1 → COMP-F → DD-F → OD-F → AD-F → CD-F | Nutrients (knowledge) flow through stages | Stages are isolated. No knowledge transfer. Each stage starts from zero. OD doesn't know what DD discovered. |
| **MUSCLE** | Research Activation Tables | Turns STORED knowledge into WORK CAPACITY | Knowledge exists but can't be applied. Research is academic, not operational. "We have findings" but no one uses them. |
| **TISSUE** | Derivation Chains + Question Generators + Identity Signatures | CONNECTS everything to origins and to the whole | No explanation of WHY. No inherited questions. Folders are containers, not actors. Can't trace why 48px and not 32px. |
| **NERVOUS SYSTEM** | Sub-agents with accumulated context (Validation, Extension, Gap-Filling, Parallel) | SENSES external world, integrates external discoveries | System is blind to external validation. No way to extend findings. No way to fill gaps. Internal echo chamber. |
| **GROWTH** | Accumulation over time (findings gain layers: applied → validated → extended → consumed → combined) | COMPOUNDS value — each finding gets richer over time | Findings are static. A finding from R-1 stays as thin as day one. No accumulation of evidence or application. |

---

### The Transformation: Before and After

**BEFORE (Files as Storage):**
```
- Files CONTAIN information → but don't transmit it
- Folders are CONTAINERS → but don't have identity
- Research EXISTS somewhere → but isn't activated
- Each stage WORKS alone → no inherited constraints
- Findings are CONCLUSIONS → without journey to origin
```

**AFTER (System as Organism):**
```
- Every file KNOWS its role in the body → IDENTITY SIGNATURE
- Every folder has PERSONALITY → "I am... I constrain... If I didn't exist..."
- Research FLOWS through activation tables → RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-[PHASE].md
- Every stage INHERITS from prior stages → CONSUMPTION-RECEIPTS, HANDOFF docs
- Findings ACCUMULATE meaning over time → Validated by X, Extended by Y, Consumed by Z
```

---

### How to Use This Metaphor (Diagnostic Questions)

When something feels wrong with the system, ask:

| If You Notice... | Ask... | Check... |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Stages feel disconnected | "Is the blood flowing?" | Are findings moving stage to stage via PIPELINE-MANIFEST? |
| Research isn't being used | "Are the muscles working?" | Are RESEARCH-ACTIVATION tables being used before building? |
| Can't explain why something is the way it is | "Is the tissue connected?" | Do patterns have DERIVATION CHAINS? Do folders have IDENTITY? |
| System feels inward-looking | "Is the nervous system sensing?" | Are sub-agents being deployed? Are EXTERNAL-### findings being created? |
| Findings feel thin/ungrounded | "Is growth happening?" | Are findings gaining layers over time? Check lifecycle status. |

## What the Visible Chain Enables

When you read a design system the normal way, you're reading conclusions. "The primary color is #E83025. The border radius is 0. Use CRESCENDO density for progressive builds." These are answers. You apply them. You don't question them because there's nothing to question — they're presented as facts, like a dictionary entry. Red means red. Zero means zero. Crescendo means crescendo.

But a conclusion without a journey is fragile. The moment someone needs to make a decision the design system didn't explicitly cover — "how should I organize this API reference that has both tutorial content and reference content?" — they have nothing to work with. The design system told them WHAT. It never showed them HOW the people who built it THOUGHT. They can't intercept the thinking because the thinking was never made visible. So they guess. They pick a pattern that seems close. They apply it mechanically. And the result looks correct on the surface but doesn't feel right, because it wasn't informed by the same understanding that produced the original patterns.

The provenance chain changes that fundamentally. It doesn't just show you the answer. It shows you the JOURNEY that arrived at the answer. And the journey teaches you something the answer alone never could: **the reasoning pattern that generated it.**

### Concrete Example: Building a "Getting Started" Guide

Someone building a new feature — a "Getting Started" guide that doesn't exist yet — opens the design system. They need to decide: what organizational pattern? What density? How should the components behave?

**Without provenance**, they open organizational-patterns.md, find NARRATIVE ARC (sparse→dense progression for learning paths), and apply it. They pick CRESCENDO density because the pattern file says so. They set border-radius to 0 because the tokens say so. Done. It's technically correct.

**With provenance**, something different happens. They open organizational-patterns.md and find NARRATIVE ARC. But now there's a "Research Provenance" field: R1-012, R1-034, DD-F-002, DD-F-007, OD-002, Soul #1, Soul #2, Soul #3. They follow the chain.

- **R1-012** says: "Stripe's getting-started guide uses progressive disclosure — each section assumes mastery of the previous one, creating a confidence ramp." That's not a rule. That's an OBSERVATION about why progressive disclosure works in documentation specifically — because readers build confidence as they go.

- **R1-034** says: "Linear's onboarding flow uses visual density to signal progress — sparse at the beginning (you're new, don't overwhelm), dense at the end (you're ready, here's everything)." That's a SECOND observation connecting density to the reader's psychological state.

- **DD-F-002** says: "CRESCENDO (sparse→dense) creates narrative progression — validated at 35/40." That's not just "use CRESCENDO." It's "we BUILT a page using CRESCENDO, tested it through perceptual auditing, and it scored 35/40 because the progressive build felt natural to navigate." The finding includes the score. The score is evidence. The evidence means this isn't preference — it's tested.

- **DD-F-007** says: "Self-similarity scored highest — consistency across scales beats variety." This is the fractal finding from DD-006 (36/40). It tells the builder: don't just use CRESCENDO at the page level. Use it at EVERY level. The section should crescendo. The subsection should crescendo. The paragraph should crescendo. Consistency across scales is what makes it feel coherent.

- **OD-002** is the actual exploration where NARRATIVE ARC was built and tested. They can open `explorations/organizational/OD-002-narrative-arc.html` in a browser and SEE what it looks like. Not a description. The actual artifact. Scored. Audited. With screenshots.

- **Soul #1** (Sharp Edges) tells them the visual language is precise, not soft. **Soul #2** (Archivist Serif) tells them wisdom content speaks in serif italic. **Soul #3** (2-zone callouts) tells them callout components have a specific family structure.

Now this person doesn't just know WHAT pattern to use. They know WHY it works (progressive disclosure builds confidence + density signals progress). They know HOW to apply it at every scale (fractal self-similarity). They know what it LOOKS like when done right (the OD-002 artifact). They know what CONSTRAINTS to respect (soul pieces). And they know all of this is VALIDATED — not someone's opinion, but tested through perceptual auditing with real scores.

That person can now make decisions the design system never explicitly covered. The guide has a section that mixes tutorial and reference? They know that progressive disclosure means the tutorial part should come first (sparse, confidence-building) and the reference should come after (dense, comprehensive). The design system didn't say that. But the REASONING behind the pattern — accessible through the provenance chain — makes it obvious. They're not guessing. They're thinking the way the system's builders thought, because the builders' thinking was made visible.

### What Thinking With the System Looks Like at Scale

Someone who traces three or four patterns through their provenance chains doesn't just learn three or four patterns. They start to understand **HOW KORTAI THINKS**. They internalize the perceptual logic: sharpness = precision, flatness = honesty, self-similarity = coherence, progressive disclosure = respect for the reader's cognitive state. They can predict what KortAI would do in situations nobody planned for, because they've absorbed the decision-making framework, not just the decisions.

And this is why the chain has to be visible in the FILE STRUCTURE, not just described in a narrative document. If the provenance only existed in BACKBONE.md as prose, you'd have to read the whole narrative to understand any single decision. But because the provenance is encoded in FOLDERS (stage-1 → stage-2 → stage-3), in FILES (outbound-findings, handoff notes, STAGE-HEADERs), in HEADERS (predecessor/successor metadata), and in PATTERN FIELDS (Research Provenance per pattern) — you can enter at ANY point and trace in ANY direction.

Enter from a pattern? Follow provenance backward to research.
Enter from a finding? Follow it forward to where it was applied.
Enter from a stage? See what it consumed and what it produced.
Enter from the BACKBONE? Get the narrative, then dive into any stage.
Enter from PIPELINE-MANIFEST? Search any finding by ID, see its full lifecycle.

The structure IS the chain. Not a description of a chain. Not a diagram of a chain. The actual folders and files and headers ARE the connective tissue. Moving through the file system is moving through the research pipeline.

# PART IV — HOW A SYSTEM SHOULD DIGEST THIS DESIGN SYSTEM

## 🚀 Digestion Starts Here

Before building anything, digest the chain. The digestion process ensures you're not just applying rules — you're absorbing the reasoning.

### Step 0: Load Research Activation (FIRST)

📥 **CONSUME BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE**

Before building an exploration:
1. Open `RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-[PHASE].md`
2. Find your exploration's column
3. Read EVERY finding marked with ✓
4. Verify you understand WHY each finding applies

This is the muscle activation. Without it, research stays stored, not transmitted.

## The Four Levels of Engagement

The provenance chain has four levels of engagement. Different tasks require different levels. Understanding which level you need — and knowing when to go deeper — is the difference between mechanical compliance and genuine understanding.

### Level 1: Application (Read the Skeleton)

You need to migrate an API reference page. You open PATTERN-INDEX.md, find "API reference → CONFIDENCE-BASED organization + CRESCENDO density." You apply those patterns. You're done. You never touched the provenance.

**This is fine for straightforward, covered cases.** The design system gave you an explicit answer. You don't need to understand why CONFIDENCE-BASED works for API references — you just need to apply it correctly.

**When Level 1 is enough:** The content type is explicitly covered in PATTERN-INDEX. The application is standard. No unusual constraints or mixed content types.

### Level 2: Understanding (Follow the Provenance Backward)

You're applying CONFIDENCE-BASED organization but something feels wrong. The pattern says to stratify by certainty level, but your content doesn't have clear certainty levels. So you follow the provenance: "Research Provenance: R1-012, DD-F-004, OD-004."

You read R1-012 — it describes how Stripe separates stable vs beta API endpoints. DD-F-004 says GEOLOGICAL density communicates hierarchy through stacked layers. OD-004 is the exploration where confidence-based flow was tested.

Now you understand: CONFIDENCE-BASED isn't about explicit certainty labels. It's about how SETTLED the information feels. Your content does have that — stable concepts vs evolving concepts. The pattern applies, but the provenance taught you HOW it applies to your specific content.

**The skeleton couldn't tell you that. The muscle could.**

**When Level 2 is needed:** The pattern applies but the fit isn't obvious. The content has nuances the pattern description doesn't address. You need to understand the INTENT behind the pattern to apply it correctly.

### Level 3: Extension (Absorb the Chain to Make New Decisions)

You have a content type the design system never explicitly addressed — say, a troubleshooting guide. No pattern in PATTERN-INDEX covers it.

A skeleton-only design system fails here. You'd have to guess or ask the designer. But with the provenance chain, you can do something different.

You read the chain for organizational patterns. You absorb HOW the patterns were derived — what research informed them, what density dimensions they sit on, what soul pieces constrain them. You notice that troubleshooting has a confidence gradient (start uncertain, get more certain as you diagnose). That's CONFIDENCE-BASED, but reversed — sparse certainty at the top, dense certainty at the bottom. CRESCENDO density, but the crescendo is toward RESOLUTION, not complexity.

You've made a decision the design system never covered, but it's CONSISTENT with the chain because you absorbed the reasoning, not just the rules. **That's what "interceptable" means** — the provenance chain lets you INTERSECT at the reasoning level and generate new, consistent decisions.

**When Level 3 is needed:** The content type or feature isn't explicitly covered. You're building something new. The design system needs to be EXTENDED, not just applied.

### Level 4: Validation (Use the Chain to Check New Work)

You've built a new exploration or section. Is it right?

A skeleton-only system can only check: "Does it use the correct tokens? Is border-radius 0? Is the color #E83025?" Those are necessary but not sufficient.

The provenance chain lets you check deeper: "Does this exploration apply the fractal principle (DD-F-006)? Is the density pattern consistent across page/section/paragraph scales? Does the organizational flow match the cognitive pattern validated in OD? Are the soul pieces not just present but ACTIVE — does the sharpness serve the precision purpose, or is it just technically compliant?"

**The chain gives you the CRITERIA for deep validation, not just surface compliance.**

**When Level 4 is needed:** After building anything. Always. Surface compliance is necessary but never sufficient.

## The Seven-Step Digestion Protocol

When a system encounters this design system for the first time — or returns to it after a context reset — it should follow these steps:

**Step 1: Read BACKBONE.md** — Get the narrative. Understand the journey. Know the stages. Know what's been completed, what's in progress, what's pending. This is the tour guide.

**Step 2: Read SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md** — Internalize the non-negotiable truths. Understand they're empirical, not arbitrary. These are the constraints that CANNOT be violated, and the reason they can't be violated is that they're extracted from the product's own identity, not imposed from outside.

**Step 3: Read the relevant pattern file** — Get the skeletal answer for the task at hand. This is the Level 1 answer. It may be sufficient. If it is, apply it and move on.

**Step 4: Follow the provenance backward** — If the Level 1 answer isn't sufficient, or if you're building something new, trace the cited findings. Read the original research. Read the outbound findings. Understand WHY the pattern is the way it is. This is where you absorb the reasoning.

**Step 5: Read outbound findings from adjacent stages** — DD findings inform OD decisions. OD findings inform AD decisions. The cross-pollination between stages is where the deepest insights live. Don't just read the immediately relevant stage — read the outbound findings from stages that seem unrelated. DD-F-006 (fractal self-similarity) was a density finding, but it applies to EVERYTHING.

**Step 6: Check PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md** — See the full lifecycle of relevant findings. Understand what's been validated vs what's still pending. Know the evidence quality behind each finding.

**Step 7: Read the HANDOFF note for the relevant transition** — Understand what constraints the previous stage established and what the current stage is responsible for producing. The handoff is the bridge. It tells you what you MUST consume, not just what's available.

**The system that does all seven steps doesn't just APPLY the design system. It THINKS WITH the design system.** It can make decisions the patterns don't cover because it's absorbed the reasoning that generated the patterns. It can validate new work against the deep criteria because it understands what made DD-006 score 36/40, not just that it did.

### 📋 After Building: Create Consumption Receipt

After completing any exploration:
1. Create `CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT-[EXPLORATION].md`
2. Document what you consumed, how you applied it, evidence locations
3. Document what you produced (new findings)
4. Update research status (PENDING → APPLIED)

This is the proof that digestion happened. Without it, "I consumed the research" is just a claim.

### ⬆️ When Asking "Why?": Use Derivation Chain

If you need to understand why a pattern exists:
1. Find the pattern in the relevant patterns file
2. Look for DERIVATION CHAIN section
3. Trace backward to research → theory → origin

This is how you understand the reasoning, not just the rule.

---

# PART V — THE INTERCEPTION FRAMEWORK

## What "Interceptable" Means

The design system isn't a rulebook you obey. It's a body of knowledge you participate in. The provenance chain is what makes participation possible.

A new feature, a new section, a new component doesn't have to blindly follow rules. It can READ the chain, understand the reasoning, and then INTERSECT at the right level:

**Intersect at the pattern level:** "This content type maps to NARRATIVE ARC + CRESCENDO density." This is straightforward application. The interception point is the pattern.

**Intersect at the finding level:** "DD-F-007 says self-similarity across scales produces the highest scores. My new component should echo the same structural rhythm at the element level that exists at the section level." The interception point is the finding — you're applying a principle that was discovered during density work to a new context.

**Intersect at the soul level:** "Soul Piece #1 says sharpness = precision = authority. This new feature handles sensitive data. Precision isn't just aesthetic here — it communicates trustworthiness. The sharpness should be EMPHASIZED, not just maintained." The interception point is the deepest level — the identity truth. You're not applying a rule. You're amplifying the meaning behind the rule because the context calls for it.

**Intersect at the methodology level:** "The design system was built through perceptual auditing — actually looking at things and discovering truths about how they feel, not just how they're coded. My new feature reveals something the existing system didn't cover. I should run a perceptual audit on my feature to discover what it's telling me, the same way Stage 1 discovered what the existing components were telling us." The interception point is the PROCESS. You're extending the system using the same methodology that built it.

## How Interception Prevents Drift

When new work intercepts the chain at the right level, the result is consistent with the existing system even if the specific case was never planned. This prevents drift — the gradual divergence that happens when new features are built by people who know the rules but don't understand the reasoning.

Without interception: "The design system says border-radius: 0, so I'll use border-radius: 0." Then later: "This tooltip feels too harsh with sharp corners. I'll add a small border-radius — just 2px, it won't matter." Then later: "This card in the new section already has 2px radius from the tooltip precedent, so I'll use that." Drift.

With interception: "The design system says border-radius: 0. The provenance chain says this is Soul Piece #1 — sharpness communicates precision and authority, and it's consistent across scales (DD-F-006 fractal principle). This tooltip needs to maintain that sharpness because the precision communicates that the system is exact and trustworthy. If the tooltip feels harsh, the problem isn't the corners — it's the density or spacing around the tooltip. Let me look at DD-F-005 (TIDAL density) for guidance on how flowing elements handle transitions." The soul piece stays intact. The density vocabulary provides the solution. No drift.

## The Sub-Agent Paradigm: External Knowledge Integration

> ### Critical: Sub-Agents Carry Accumulated Context from Inline Sections
>
> When deploying sub-agents for external research, the prompt MUST include context accumulated from **inline threading sections**. This is what makes the research COMPOUND rather than just accumulate.
>
> **Before deploying a sub-agent, traverse the relevant inline sections and extract:**
> - What you **KNOW** (from BUILT ON, MUST HONOR)
> - What you're **UNCERTAIN** about (from RESEARCH DEBT)
> - What **CONSTRAINTS** are active (from MUST HONOR)
>
> Then embed this in the sub-agent prompt. A sub-agent searching with accumulated context will find research that INTEGRATES into our provenance chain. A sub-agent searching generically will find disconnected articles that can't be threaded.

### The Shift: Generic → Context-Aware Research

**BEFORE (Generic Prompt):**
```
"Research cognitive load patterns in documentation"
```
This produces generic results disconnected from our chain.

**AFTER (Context-Carrying Prompt):**
```
"Research cognitive load patterns in documentation.
Context: DD-F-006 establishes fractal self-similarity.
Task: Find external evidence that VALIDATES or CHALLENGES this finding.
Output: EXTERNAL-V-### or EXTERNAL-E-### with VALIDATES/CHALLENGES/EXTENDS relationship."
```
This produces findings that integrate with our chain.

### The Four Sub-Agent Types

---

### Sub-Agent Type 1: VALIDATION AGENT

**Purpose:** Find external evidence that VALIDATES or CHALLENGES internal findings.
**Output ID Format:** `EXTERNAL-V-###` (e.g., EXTERNAL-V-001)
**When to Deploy:** After a finding scores ≥34/40, before marking as soul-level, when constraining multiple stages

**Prompt Template:**
```
You are a validation research agent for the KORTAI design system.

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION
Find external evidence that VALIDATES or CHALLENGES a specific internal finding.

## 📦 CONTEXT YOU CARRY
**The Finding to Validate:**
- **ID:** DD-F-006
- **Statement:** "Fractal self-similarity at all scales"
- **Score:** 36/40 (highest in DD phase)
- **Consequence If Wrong:** Every OD exploration built on it is compromised

## 🔍 YOUR TASK
Search for external research on:
1. Fractal patterns in information architecture
2. Visual consistency across scales
3. Design systems using fractal/recursive principles
4. Cognitive science on pattern recognition at multiple scales

## 📤 OUTPUT FORMAT
| External Source | What They Found | Relationship to DD-F-006 | Confidence Impact | Integration Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Author, Year] | [finding] | VALIDATES / CHALLENGES / EXTENDS | +X% or -X% | [how to integrate] |

## 🔗 INTEGRATION PATH
- VALIDATES → Add citation to DD-F-006, become EXTERNAL-V-###
- CHALLENGES → Flag for review, note in RESEARCH-DEBT
- EXTENDS → Become candidate for new exploration
```

**What Breaks If Validation Agents Don't Exist:**
- Findings stay internally validated only
- No external grounding
- Confirmation bias
- No confidence scaling

---

### Sub-Agent Type 2: EXTENSION AGENT

**Purpose:** Go DEEP on a finding. Explore contexts, variants, edge cases.
**Output ID Format:** `EXTERNAL-E-###` or variants like `OD-F-007a`
**When to Deploy:** Finding applies to multiple contexts, has accessibility/i18n implications

**Prompt Template:**
```
You are an extension research agent for the KORTAI design system.

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION
Go DEEP on a specific finding. Create variants if needed.

## 📦 THE FINDING TO EXTEND
**Finding ID:** OD-F-007
**Statement:** "Task clusters need 48px minimum gap"
**Current Scope:** Desktop only, English, sighted users
**NOT tested:** Mobile, RTL, screen readers, touch

## 🔍 QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE
**Context Variants:**
1. Does 48px work on mobile (320px-768px)?
2. Does 48px work for RTL languages?

**Accessibility:**
3. What spacing do screen reader users need?
4. What works for users with cognitive disabilities?

## 📤 OUTPUT FORMAT
| Question | Context | External Finding | Source | Implication for OD-F-007 |
|----------|---------|------------------|--------|--------------------------|
| [question] | [context] | [finding] | [source] | CONFIRMS / MODIFIES / VARIANT NEEDED |

**If VARIANT NEEDED:**
OD-F-007a: [CONTEXT-SPECIFIC STATEMENT]
- Context: [when this applies]
- Modification: [how differs from original]
- Source: EXTERNAL-E-###
```

**What Breaks If Extension Agents Don't Exist:**
- Findings are context-blind
- Accessibility gaps invisible
- i18n issues surface late

---

### Sub-Agent Type 3: GAP-FILLING AGENT

**Purpose:** Address RESEARCH DEBT — questions acknowledged but never explored.
**Output ID Format:** `EXTERNAL-G-###`, `ACCESSIBILITY-###`, `MOBILE-###`
**When to Deploy:** Debt at HIGH risk, building on uncovered ground, a11y/i18n/mobile debt blocking

**Prompt Template:**
```
You are a gap-filling research agent for the KORTAI design system.

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION
Fill a specific RESEARCH DEBT.

## 📦 THE GAP TO FILL
**Question:** "Accessibility at high density — how do screen readers handle dense layouts?"
**Origin:** R3-044
**Risk level:** HIGH — WCAG violations would make DD patterns unusable

## 🔍 YOUR TASK
**WCAG Compliance:**
1. What WCAG guidelines apply to information density?
2. What contrast/spacing requirements exist?

**Screen Reader Behavior:**
3. How do screen readers convey visual density?
4. What semantic structures replace visual grouping?

## 📤 OUTPUT FORMAT
| Gap Area | External Finding | WCAG Alignment | Severity | Implementation for DD |
|----------|------------------|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| [gap] | [finding] | [WCAG criterion] | CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM | [adaptation needed] |

**If CRITICAL finding:**
ACCESSIBILITY-###: [CONSTRAINT STATEMENT]
- WCAG Reference: [criterion]
- Consequence If Ignored: [risk]
- Mandatory For: [all affected stages]
```

**What Breaks If Gap-Filling Agents Don't Exist:**
- Debt stays as questions, never findings
- Accessibility violations ship
- Legal/ethical risk accumulates

---

### Sub-Agent Type 4: PARALLEL EXPLORATION AGENT

**Purpose:** Deploy MULTIPLE agents simultaneously for broad perspective.
**Output ID Format:** `PARALLEL-[TOPIC]-[AGENT]-###`, `SYNTHESIS-[TOPIC]-###`
**When to Deploy:** Starting new stage, controversial finding, need landscape understanding

**Deployment Template:**
```
## 🔄 PARALLEL EXPLORATION: Cognitive Rhythm in Documentation

Deploy 4 agents in parallel:

### 🅰️ AGENT A: ACADEMIC RESEARCH
Focus: Cognitive psychology literature
Output: | Academic Finding | Source | Relevance to OD | Confidence |

SYNTHESIS-[TOPIC]-###: [SYNTHESIZED FINDING]
```

**What Breaks If Parallel Agents Don't Exist:**
- Single perspective blindness
- Overconfidence in single sources
- Miss cross-domain insights
- Can't distinguish signal from noise

### Integration Protocol: 5 Steps

When external findings return:

1. **Assign ID:** EXTERNAL-V/E/G-###
2. **Link to internal chain:** What it validates/extends/fills
3. **Update consumption status:** Internal finding gains confidence or flagged
4. **Flow forward:** Enters handoff documents
5. **Update questions:** New questions for next stage

---

## The Three Dimensions of Growth

### Dimension 1: DEPTH (Internal Pipeline)

**Definition:** Internal exploration through the pipeline
**Path:** R-1→R-5 → COMP-F → DD-F → OD-F → AD-F → CD-F
**Meaning:** Each stage produces findings that flow to the next

### Dimension 2: BREADTH (External Sub-Agents)

**Definition:** External exploration via sub-agents
**Mechanism:** Sub-agents search academic research, industry practice, adjacent domains
**Integration:** External findings integrate via EXTERNAL-### IDs
**Activities:** Validation, extension, and gap-filling enrich the chain

### Dimension 3: TIME (Accumulation)

**Definition:** Each exploration adds to total weight

**Example with ALL layers:**
A finding from R1-007 becomes:
- Applied in OD-001
- Validated by EXTERNAL-V-003
- Extended by OD-F-012
- Consumed by AD-001
- Combined in CD-003
- ...carrying 6 layers of meaning by the end

This is the time dimension: findings get RICHER, not just more numerous.

## Growing the System vs. Breaking It

The provenance chain also establishes the standard of evidence for extending the system. If someone discovers a potential new soul piece — say, a particular color treatment that feels deeply right for KortAI — the chain shows them what "discovery" looks like:

- Soul pieces were EXTRACTED from existing code through perceptual auditing (not decided in a meeting)
- They were VALIDATED across 6 density explorations (not tested once)
- They were CONSISTENT across scales — element, component, section, page (not just at one level)
- They were SCORED through systematic evaluation (not reviewed informally)

That's the evidence standard. A new soul piece needs to meet it. And the provenance chain makes that standard visible, so extending the system maintains the same rigor that built it.

# PART VI — HOW TO REPRODUCE THIS FROM SCRATCH

## The Honest Answer

You can't reproduce this exactly. And that's the point.

What happened here wasn't planned. The process started with "I have 11 components and I want to understand them." The provenance chain exists BECAUSE the process was discovery-based, not decision-based. Nobody decided border-radius should be 0. It was discovered that it was already 0 and then understood WHY it was 0 and what that meant about KortAI's identity.

You can't plan to discover things. But you CAN set up a process that makes discovery inevitable and makes the chain capture itself as you go.

## The Seven Structures as Day-One Creation

If starting from scratch, create these structures IMMEDIATELY:

1. **Research Activation Tables** — Before first exploration
2. **Derivation Chain sections** — In every pattern file from the start
3. **Exploration Protocol** — Before building anything
4. **Consumption Receipt template** — For every completed exploration
5. **Question Generator** — In PIPELINE-MANIFEST from day one
6. **Reflection Protocol** — Run after every exploration
7. **Identity Signatures** — In every folder's CLAUDE.md

The chain builds itself when these structures exist from the beginning.

## The Nine Principles

### 1. Start with what exists, not what you want.

Most design systems start with "what should it look like?" This one started with "what does it ALREADY look like, and what is it trying to tell us?" That audit-first approach is the foundation. If you skip it and start making decisions, you have nothing to discover. You're just writing rules. Rules don't compound. Discoveries do.

### 2. Audit perceptually, not just technically.

A technical audit says "this component has border-radius: 4px, that one has border-radius: 0, there's inconsistency, let's pick one." A perceptual audit says "when I LOOK at these components as a family, the ones with sharp edges feel more like KortAI. Why? What does sharpness mean for this product? Precision. Authority. The codebase is telling me something." The perceptual layer is where soul pieces come from. Without it, you get a style guide, not a design system with identity.

### 3. Document findings with IDs from the first discovery.

This is the one thing you CAN do from day one that saves you from having to retroactively activate a backbone later. The moment you discover something — "sharp edges are identity, not style" — give it an ID. COMP-F-001. Write it down with: what was discovered, how it was discovered, what it means, what should consume it next. If you start doing this from the first audit, the provenance chain builds itself. You never have a "scattered markdown files" problem because every file was born connected.

### 4. Build explorations that formally CONSUME prior findings.

This is the gate file concept. Before you build anything, write down: "I am building this exploration. It consumes these specific findings [IDs]. It will test these specific hypotheses. It will be validated by these specific criteria." That gate file IS the muscle tissue. It's the document that says "this exploration exists BECAUSE those findings exist." Without it, you build explorations that are informed by prior work but don't formally reference it. The connection is in someone's head, not in the system.

### 5. Score and validate through perceptual auditing, not just review.

The /perceptual-deepening skill is what turns subjective design review into scored, iterable assessment. DD-006 didn't score 36/40 because someone thought it looked nice. It scored 36/40 because a systematic perceptual evaluation found that fractal self-similarity produced the strongest cognitive response across multiple assessment dimensions. That score IS evidence. It's what makes the finding validated rather than opined.

### 6. Generate outbound findings after every stage.

This is the step most people would skip. You finish DD, you have your density patterns, you move on to OD. What you DON'T naturally do is sit down and ask: "What did DD teach me that ISN'T about density? What did I learn about component behavior under pressure? About iteration methodology? About what makes the perceptual skill work better?"

Those cross-domain insights are the outbound findings. They're what makes the chain COMPOUND rather than just accumulate. DD-F-006 (fractal self-similarity) isn't a density finding — it's a UNIVERSAL finding that happened to be discovered during density work. It applies to OD, AD, CD, everything. If you don't extract it, it stays buried in a DD checkpoint file and OD never benefits.

### 7. Write the handoff note before you move on.

Not after. Before. While you still remember what the next stage needs. The handoff is the bridge. It says "here's what I consumed, here's what I produced, here's what the next stage MUST consume from me, and here's what the next stage is responsible for producing." It's the connective tissue between stages. Without it, each stage starts fresh and has to rediscover what the previous stage already knew.

### 8. Each new stage's gate formally references prior stage findings.

This is what makes the compounding real. Stage 3's research gate doesn't just say "I've read the DD patterns." It says "I am consuming DD-F-001 (finding text) applied to OD-003 (specific exploration) because (specific reasoning)." Finding-by-finding. The gate is the proof that prior research is actually flowing forward, not just acknowledged.

### 9. The chain builds itself because every step formally references what came before.

If you do all eight steps above from the start, you never need a retroactive activation protocol. The backbone exists from day one. The activation protocol only exists because we didn't do steps 3, 6, and 7 from the beginning — we discovered their importance THROUGH the process. That discovery is itself a finding worth capturing.

# PART VII — THE FILE STRUCTURE AS EMBODIED KNOWLEDGE

## How the Folders Work

The design system lives in `docs-spa/showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/`. Here's how the folder structure embodies the knowledge chain:

### The Output Layer: What to Use

```
DESIGN-SYSTEM/
├── tokens/           ← WHAT the system uses (colors, geometry, spacing, typography)
├── components/       ← HOW elements behave
├── patterns/         ← WHEN to apply what (density, organizational, axis, combination)
├── guides/           ← HOW to migrate and apply
└── anti-patterns/    ← What NOT to do
```

This is the skeleton. If you only need Level 1 engagement, this is sufficient.

### The Provenance Layer: Why It's This Way

```
DESIGN-SYSTEM/provenance/
├── PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md     ← The database of every finding
├── RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md       ← Application tracking
├── SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md      ← The non-negotiable identity truths
├── original-research/       ← R-1→R-5 source documents
├── stage-1-components/      ← Component foundation chain
├── stage-2-density-dd/      ← Density exploration chain
├── stage-3-organization-od/ ← Organizational exploration chain
├── stage-4-axis-ad/         ← Axis exploration chain
└── stage-5-combination-cd/  ← Combination exploration chain
```

This is the muscle. Level 2-4 engagement requires reading here.

### The Operational Layer: Current Work State

```
showcase/checkpoints/
├── MASTER-STATE.md           ← Current project position
├── [PHASE]-CHECKPOINT.md     ← Live iteration tracking
├── [PHASE]-RESEARCH-GATE.md  ← Finding-to-exploration mapping
├── RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md        ← Live research tracking (syncs to provenance/)
└── SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md       ← Live soul tracking (syncs to provenance/)
```

This is the nervous system during active work. After a stage completes, key files are finalized and synced to provenance/.

### The Artifacts: What Was Built

```
showcase/explorations/
├── density/          ← 6 DD HTML explorations (complete)
├── organizational/   ← 6 OD HTML explorations (in progress)
├── axis/             ← 6 AD HTML explorations (future)
└── combination/      ← 6 CD HTML explorations (future)
```

These are the actual built artifacts — HTML files you can open in a browser. They use inline KortAI styles (correct colors), not globals.css (outdated).

### The Navigation Layer (Added Phase 2B)

In addition to the Output, Provenance, Operational, and Artifacts layers, Phase 2B added a **Navigation layer**:

```
showcase/
├── FOLDER-MAP.md          ← Single-file codebase map with T1/T2 classification
├── CLAUDE.md              ← Lab-level navigation and process enforcement
├── DESIGN-SYSTEM/
│   └── CLAUDE.md          ← Design system navigation and identity
├── checkpoints/
│   └── CLAUDE.md          ← Operational checkpoint navigation
├── explorations/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md          ← Exploration navigation
│   └── density/
│       └── CLAUDE.md      ← Density exploration navigation
├── research/
│   └── CLAUDE.md          ← Research stream navigation
└── knowledge-architecture/
    └── CLAUDE.md          ← KA folder navigation
```

**FOLDER-MAP.md** provides:
- Complete codebase structure at a glance
- T1 (authoritative) vs T2 (derivative) classification
- Context Recovery section showing current phase state
- Cross-references to detailed CLAUDE.md files

**CLAUDE.md files** provide:
- Per-folder navigation with identity signatures
- File listings with status and purpose
- How the folder connects to the pipeline
- What to read first and in what order

This layer enables faster **Context Recovery** (Mode 3) — instead of reading multiple files to understand structure, read FOLDER-MAP.md first, then the CLAUDE.md in your target directory.

### Inline Threading Sections (Added Phase 2B)

Every file in the system now carries its own provenance metadata as an inline threading section. These sections are invisible in rendered views (HTML comments for .md, block comments for .css/.tsx) but visible in source. They contain:

- **WHY THIS EXISTS** — file identity and authority
- **BUILT ON** — upstream dependencies (backward traversal)
- **CONSUMED BY** — downstream consumers (forward traversal)
- **MUST HONOR** — constraints that cannot be violated (Tier A/B only)
- **DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS** — testable verification before modification (Tier A/B only)

This means the provenance chain is no longer only in the folder structure — it is embedded at the point of use, in every file.

## New Files Required

> **Phase 2B Status Note (2026-02-06):** Many items below are now fulfilled via inline threading sections. The inline sections embedded in each file serve the same PURPOSE as the standalone files listed here. Items marked ✅ are functionally complete via inline sections. Items marked ⏳ still need standalone files or formal sections.

### Files to Create

| File | Location | Purpose | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-DD.md | provenance/stage-2-density-dd/ | Maps R-3 findings → DD explorations | ✅ Via inline BUILT ON in DD-001 through DD-006 |
| RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-OD.md | provenance/stage-3-organization-od/ | Maps R-1 + DD-F findings → OD explorations | ⏳ Consolidated matrix still useful for OD planning |
| EXPLORATION-PROTOCOL-OD.md | provenance/stage-3-organization-od/ | OD building instructions | ✅ OD Execution Protocol v2.0 exists |
| CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT-DD-001.md | provenance/stage-2-density-dd/ | Proof of DD-001 consumption | ✅ Via inline CONSUMED BY in DD files |
| ... (DD-002 through DD-006) | ... | ... | ✅ Via inline CONSUMED BY |

### Sections to Add

| Section | Add To | Purpose | Status |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| QUESTIONS | PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md | Per-stage question inheritance | ⏳ RESEARCH DEBT in inline sections captures gaps, but formal question inheritance needed |
| DERIVATION CHAIN | Every pattern in density-patterns.md | Backward traversal | ⏳ Inline BUILT ON shows upstream, but narrative derivation chains not yet in pattern descriptions |
| IDENTITY SIGNATURE | Every CLAUDE.md | Folder personality | ✅ Via WHY THIS EXISTS + CLAUDE.md inline sections |
| `source:` field | Every finding | Which exploration created it | ✅ Via inline BUILT ON tables |
| `built_on:` field | Every finding | Prior findings it builds on | ✅ Via inline BUILT ON tables |

## CLAUDE.md Files — How to Read Each Folder

Every significant folder has a CLAUDE.md file that explains:
- **What's in this folder** — file listing with purpose and status
- **How to read it** — what to start with, what order to follow
- **How it connects** — where this folder sits in the pipeline chain
- **What's current vs deprecated** — so systems don't reference outdated content
- **How to use it** — when you'd reference these files, what they feed into
- **🪪 IDENTITY SIGNATURE** — folder personality (I Am, I Carry, I Produce, I Constrain)

These files are the navigational guides. They make the system self-documenting — you don't need an external manual to understand the structure, because the structure explains itself.

## The Four Master Documents

| Document | Purpose | Analogy |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **BACKBONE.md** | The narrative chain. The complete story of how the system was built, stage by stage. | The tour guide |
| **PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md** | The finding database. Every finding mapped with ID, text, source, application status, lifecycle. | The medical records |
| **PATTERN-INDEX.md** | The practical application guide. Content type → organizational pattern + density pattern. | The prescription |
| **SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md** | The identity constants. What cannot be violated, and why. | The DNA test results |

## How to Navigate

| I want to... | Start here |
|--------------|------------|
| Understand the whole system | BACKBONE.md |
| Apply a pattern to specific content | PATTERN-INDEX.md |
| Understand WHY a pattern exists | The pattern's "Research Provenance" field → follow the IDs |
| Check if a finding has been applied | PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md |
| Understand the non-negotiable constraints | SOUL-DISCOVERIES.md |
| See what a stage consumed and produced | provenance/stage-[N]-*/STAGE-HEADER.md |
| See what one stage learned for the next | provenance/stage-[N]-*/[PHASE]-outbound-findings.md |
| See the bridge between stages | provenance/stage-[N]-*/HANDOFF-[FROM]-TO-[TO].md |
| See the actual built artifact | explorations/[phase]/[exploration].html |
| See current project state | checkpoints/MASTER-STATE.md |

# PART VIII — THE META-INSIGHT

## What We Actually Built

The ultimate question behind every structural decision, every CLAUDE.md file, every handoff note, every outbound finding was this: **Is there a structure for organizing design research that makes the research itself teachable — not just to humans reading documentation, but to AI systems that need to make consistent design decisions in contexts the original research never covered?**

Everything documented here — the provenance chain, the activation protocol, the continuity formula, the CLAUDE.md depth requirements, the outbound findings, the handoff notes, the gate files, the provenance headers — all of it is an attempt to answer yes. To build a structure where the reasoning is so visible, so traceable, so connected that absorbing it doesn't just give you rules. It gives you the capacity to reason the way the rules were reasoned.

That's the design mind. Not a design system. A design mind.

The design system is the skeleton — the tokens, patterns, components, rules. You can read it and build compliant work.

The design mind is the skeleton plus the muscle plus the blood plus the tissue — the provenance chain, the outbound findings, the handoff notes, the stage progression, the soul pieces, the scores, the iteration lessons, the cross-domain insights. You can read it and build work that's not just compliant, but CONSISTENT with the identity in contexts nobody planned for.

The difference is the difference between a system that OBEYS rules and a system that UNDERSTANDS WHY the rules exist well enough to generate new, valid rules when the existing ones don't cover the situation.

## The Three Dimensions as Complete Vision

The complete vision is three-dimensional:

1. **DEPTH** — Internal exploration through the pipeline (R-1 → COMP-F → DD-F → OD-F → AD-F → CD-F)
2. **BREADTH** — External exploration via sub-agents (EXTERNAL-V/E/G findings enriching the chain)
3. **TIME** — Each exploration adds layers (a finding gains meaning through application, validation, extension, consumption, combination)

This is the living system reality. Not a filing system. Not a documentation project. A living organism that grows in all three dimensions.

## The Provenance Chain as Participation

The design system isn't a rulebook you obey. It's a body of knowledge you participate in. The provenance chain is what makes participation possible — because you can see not just what was decided, but HOW decisions were made, WHAT evidence justified them, and WHERE your new work fits into the existing chain.

You're not appending to a list. You're growing the body. The muscle and tissue you add connects to the muscle and tissue that's already there, because the connective structure is visible and followable.

A new feature reveals something the existing system didn't cover? Run a perceptual audit. Extract the discovery. Give it an ID. Document how it was found. Connect it to existing findings. Update the provenance. The chain grows. The mind deepens.

A new stage discovers a tension between two existing patterns? The provenance shows which research justified each pattern. Evaluate the evidence. Resolve the tension. Document the resolution. The chain becomes more nuanced. The mind becomes wiser.

A migration engineer encounters content the pattern index doesn't cover? Follow the provenance for the closest pattern. Absorb the reasoning. Generate a consistent decision. Document the extension. The chain expands. The mind extends.

This is what "transferable" means. The mind doesn't live in one person's head or one AI session's context window. It lives in the structure. Anyone who follows the structure absorbs the mind. Anyone who extends the structure grows the mind. The provenance chain is the medium through which design understanding propagates — not as rules to follow, but as reasoning to participate in.

# PART IX — RETROACTIVE UPDATE EXECUTION

## The Bridge: From Document to Codebase

This document describes the structures. As of Phase 2B (2026-02-06), most structures now EXIST via inline threading sections embedded in 253 files. The remaining work focuses on formalizing the Question Generator, creating HANDOFF documents for stages 3-5, and running the full Reflection Protocol retroactively on completed explorations.

---

## What Exists vs What Must Be Created

| Structure | Currently Exists? | Implementation | Location |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| Research Activation Tables | ✅ YES (via inline BUILT ON) | Phase 2B inline threading sections | Each file's inline section |
| Derivation Chains | ✅ YES (via inline BUILT ON + MUST HONOR) | Phase 2B inline threading sections | Each file's inline section — follow BUILT ON chain backward |
| Exploration Protocol | ✅ YES | OD Execution Protocol v2.0 | provenance/stage-3-organization-od/ |
| Consumption Receipts | ✅ YES (via inline CONSUMED BY) | Phase 2B inline threading sections | Each file's inline section |
| Question Generator | ⚠️ PARTIAL (via RESEARCH DEBT) | Phase 2B inline sections capture known gaps | Inline sections + PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md |
| Reflection Protocol | ✅ YES (via DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS) | Phase 2B inline threading sections | Each file's inline section |
| Identity Signatures | ✅ YES (via WHY THIS EXISTS + STATUS) | Phase 2B inline sections + CLAUDE.md files | Each file's inline section + folder CLAUDE.md files |
| `source:` fields | ✅ YES (via inline BUILT ON) | Phase 2B inline threading sections | Each file's BUILT ON table |
| `built_on:` fields | ✅ YES (via inline BUILT ON) | Phase 2B inline threading sections | Each file's BUILT ON table |
| HANDOFF documents | ⚠️ PARTIAL | HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md exists, others needed | provenance/ folders |

> **Phase 2B Update (2026-02-06):** The inline threading sections added to 253 files embody the 7 provenance structures described above. Rather than creating separate files for each structure, the structures are embedded IN each file's inline section. This approach has two advantages:
>
> 1. **The provenance travels WITH the file** — not in a separate location that can become desynchronized
> 2. **Modification guards are visible immediately** when opening any file — no need to consult an external document
>
> The structures exist. The retroactive work below focuses on USING them (for OD/AD/CD stages), not creating them from scratch.

---

## Execution Sequence

> **Phase 2B Status Note:** Many items below are now ✅ DONE via inline threading sections. Items marked ✅ exist in the inline sections of affected files. Items marked ⏳ still require explicit action.

```
PHASE 1: Foundation
│
├─→ ⏳ Add QUESTIONS section to PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md
│   Template: Use the Question Generator format from PART III
│   (RESEARCH DEBT in inline sections captures SOME gaps, but a formal
│    per-stage question inheritance section is still needed)
│
├─→ ✅ DONE: `source:` and `built_on:` fields exist via inline BUILT ON
│   (Each file's inline section has a BUILT ON table with upstream sources)
│
└─→ ⏳ Decide: What is the ID format for external findings?
    Recommendation: EXTERNAL-V-###, EXTERNAL-E-###, EXTERNAL-G-###

PHASE 2: Stage 2 (DD) Retroactive
│
├─→ ✅ DONE: Research activation exists via inline BUILT ON in DD-001 through DD-006
│   (Each DD file's inline section shows which R-3 findings it consumes)
│
├─→ ⏳ Run REFLECTION-PROTOCOL retroactively on DD-001 through DD-006
│   For each: What was VALIDATED? CHALLENGED? What NEW questions emerged?
│   (DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS exist in inline sections but full reflection
│    protocol — with validated/challenged/new-questions — is richer)
│
├─→ ✅ DONE: Consumption tracking exists via inline CONSUMED BY
│   (Downstream consumers are documented in each file's inline section)
│
├─→ ⏳ Add DERIVATION CHAIN section to each pattern in density-patterns.md
│   6 patterns: PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL, FRACTAL
│   (Inline BUILT ON shows upstream, but formal derivation chains with
│    reasoning narrative are not yet in the pattern descriptions)
│
├─→ ✅ DONE: Identity exists via inline WHY THIS EXISTS + CLAUDE.md
│
└─→ ⏳ Extract DD's unanswered questions → add to QUESTIONS section
    Move from DD observations to explicit questions for OD

PHASE 3: Stage 1 (Components) Retroactive
│
├─→ ✅ DONE: `source:` and `built_on:` exist via inline BUILT ON
│
├─→ ✅ DONE: Identity exists via inline WHY THIS EXISTS + CLAUDE.md
│
└─→ ⏳ Verify soul pieces have derivation
    Where did #1-#5 come from? What exploration discovered them?

PHASE 4: Stage 3 (OD) Preparation
│
├─→ ⏳ Create consolidated RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-OD.md
│   (Inline BUILT ON shows per-file dependencies, but a consolidated
│    matrix mapping R-1 + DD-F findings → OD explorations is still useful)
│
├─→ ✅ DONE: EXPLORATION-PROTOCOL-OD exists (OD Execution Protocol v2.0)
│
├─→ ✅ DONE: HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md exists with MANDATORY findings list
│
├─→ ⏳ Template CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT for OD-001 through OD-004
│   (Inline CONSUMED BY will track this automatically once OD work begins)
│
└─→ ✅ DONE: Identity exists via CLAUDE.md inline threading section
```

---

## Verification Tests

> **Phase 2B Note:** Tests A and D reference standalone files (CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT, DERIVATION CHAIN) that are now partially fulfilled via inline sections (CONSUMED BY, BUILT ON). For those items, check the inline threading section of the relevant file. Tests B and C reference some files that already exist (EXPLORATION-PROTOCOL-OD, HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD, CLAUDE.md identity sections).

After all retroactive updates, these tests must PASS:

### Test A: Backward Traversal Works
**Test:** Pick any finding (e.g., DD-F-006). Can you trace to origin?

```
DD-F-006
    → Has `source:` field? → DD-003 (or whichever exploration)
    → Has `built_on:` field? → R3-### IDs
    → Exploration has CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT? → Shows what was consumed
    → Pattern has DERIVATION CHAIN? → Shows reasoning and citations
```

**Pass Criteria:** Complete path exists from finding to cited theory
**Fail Action:** Add missing `source:`, `built_on:`, DERIVATION CHAIN, or CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT

### Test B: Forward Traversal Works
**Test:** Pick any upcoming exploration (e.g., OD-003). Can you find what to consume?

```
OD-003
    → RESEARCH-ACTIVATION-OD.md exists? → Has OD-003 column with ✓ marks
    → QUESTIONS section exists? → Shows what OD-003 must answer
    → EXPLORATION-PROTOCOL-OD.md exists? → Shows density pairing (ISLANDS)
    → HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md exists? → Lists mandatory DD findings
```

**Pass Criteria:** All 4 documents exist and are complete for OD-003
**Fail Action:** Create missing activation table, questions section, protocol, or handoff

### Test C: Identity Exists
**Test:** Pick any stage folder. Does its CLAUDE.md have identity?

```
stage-2-density-dd/CLAUDE.md
    → Has "I am:" statement?
    → Has "I constrain:" statement?
    → Has "If I didn't exist:" statement?
    → Has "My strongest/weakest:"?
```

**Pass Criteria:** All 7 identity fields present
**Fail Action:** Add IDENTITY SIGNATURE section

### Test D: Receipts Prove Consumption
**Test:** Pick any completed exploration (e.g., DD-003). Does it have a receipt?

```
DD-003 (ISLANDS pattern)
    → CONSUMPTION-RECEIPT-DD-003.md exists?
    → Shows what R-3 findings were consumed?
    → Has evidence locations for each claim?
    → Has soul pieces verification table?
    → Shows what was produced (DD-F findings)?
```

**Pass Criteria:** Complete receipt with evidence locations
**Fail Action:** Create consumption receipt with full format

## The Handoff

When this document is used to perform retroactive updates:

### Before Starting
1. **READ** this entire DESIGN-MIND document (Mode 1: First Read)
2. **ABSORB** the 7 structures and their exact formats from PART III
3. **UNDERSTAND** the traversal requirements from PART III

### During Execution
4. **EXECUTE** the retroactive updates in the sequence above (Phases 1-4)
5. **CHECKPOINT** after each phase — don't proceed if tests fail

### After Completing
6. **VERIFY** using the 4 tests above (A, B, C, D)
7. **REPORT** what was created

### Executor Deliverables
The person executing retroactive updates should produce:

| Deliverable | Format |
|-------------|--------|
| Files Created | List with full paths |
| Sections Added | List with file and line numbers |
| Fields Added | List with document and finding IDs |
| Test A Result | PASS/FAIL with evidence |
| Test B Result | PASS/FAIL with evidence |
| Test C Result | PASS/FAIL with evidence |
| Test D Result | PASS/FAIL with evidence |
| New Research Debt | Any gaps discovered during updates |

---

## What Breaks If PART IX Doesn't Exist
- Document and codebase are disconnected
- No execution sequence — updates happen in wrong order
- No verification tests — can't know if updates are complete
- No handoff instructions — executor doesn't know where to start
- Retroactive work is "do something" instead of "complete this checklist"

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Color sync | PENDING | globals.css uses teal/white (#0D9373, #fff). DESIGN-SYSTEM/tokens/colors.md has KortAI (#E83025, #FEF9F5). DD explorations use correct inline KortAI colors. |
| poc/ deprecation | DOCUMENTED | 27 POC directories mostly superseded by showcase/. See app/poc/CLAUDE.md. |
| README.md outdated | ✅ RESOLVED | Updated 2026-02-07 to reflect Phase 2B inline sections, navigation layer, and context recovery improvements. |

# APPENDIX B — DOCUMENT RELATIONSHIPS

## The Complete Document Set

| Document | Purpose | When Used |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **This document (KORTAI-DESIGN-MIND.md)** | Understanding what this system IS and how to think with it | Onboarding, context resets, new projects |
| **BACKBONE-ACTIVATION-PROTOCOL** | One-time executable to organize existing files into provenance structure | Before OD begins (once) |
| **RESEARCH-CONTINUITY-FORMULA v2** | 9-step repeatable process for phase transitions | At every phase boundary (OD→AD, AD→CD, CD→Migration) |
| **RESEARCH-BACKBONE-ARCHITECTURE** | Reference: why the folder structure exists and how layers relate | When explaining the system's organization |
| **OD-COMPREHENSIVE-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL** | How to build OD explorations specifically | During OD building |
| **STRUCTURAL-GOVERNANCE-STANDARD** | Quality rules for CLAUDE.md files and provenance structure | When creating or auditing structural documents |

The DESIGN-MIND document is the philosophical foundation. The other documents are operational — they DO things. This document explains WHY those things are done and HOW to think about what they produce.

> The design system is the skeleton — tokens, patterns, rules.
> The provenance chain is the muscle — causal connections, outbound findings, handoffs.
> The soul pieces are the DNA — identity truths extracted, not decided.
> The scores are the evidence — perceptual validation, not opinion.
> The CLAUDE.md files are the nervous system — self-documenting navigation.
> The backbone is the narrative — the story of how all of this was built.
> Together, they are not a design system. They are a design mind.
> And the mind is transferable.

# OD-CHECKPOINT — Structural State Tracker
## Updated After Every Major Operation

---

## CURRENT POSITION

**Currently Working On:** Synthesis documents (OD-SYNTHESIS, HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD)
**Last Action:** VISUAL AUDIT COMPLETE — ALL 6 ODs PASS. 0 border-radius violations, 0 box-shadow violations, 3,479 DOM elements checked. All threading headers verified. All DD sources updated.
**Next Action:** OD synthesis documents → HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD → ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2 final → HUMAN PAUSE.
**Quality Trajectory:** OD-001 ~35/40, OD-002 ~33/40, OD-003 ~35/40, OD-004 INCLUDE, OD-005 INCLUDE, OD-006 INCLUDE (crown jewel)

**Quick Recovery Pointers:**
- Gate file: `provenance/stage-3-organization-od/OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md`
- OD-001: `explorations/organizational/OD-001-conversational.html` (BUILD AUDIT PASSED, threading in progress)
- OD-002: `explorations/organizational/OD-002-narrative.html` (Builder working)
- Latest screenshot: N/A (recovery — no screenshots from lost session)
- Key constraint: DD-F-006 FRACTAL applies to ALL ODs

## IDENTITY VERSION

**Current:** v0→v1 transition (OD-001 complete, identity enriching)
**Source:** Traverser absorbed DD-001, DD-003, DD-005, DD-006, T1 synthesis, soul, tokens, R1, density-patterns, DD-outbound-findings
**OD-001 Addition:** Conversational pattern naturally creates PULSE. Organization SERVES density (validates DD-F-010).

## PER-OD STATE SNAPSHOTS

### OD-001 Conversational (PULSE + TIDAL)
**Status:** VISUAL AUDIT PASSED — Soul compliant, 0 violations
**Score:** ~35/40 (Innovation: 8, Utility: 9, Soul: 9, Execution: 9)
**Decision:** INCLUDE
**Build Audit:** PASS (all 16 checks, 1 advisory: R1-026 declared not implemented)
**Guardian:** PASSED (5/5)
**Key Insight:** Conversational pattern NATURALLY creates PULSE density — questions inherently sparse, answers inherently dense
**DD Sources:** DD-005, DD-006, DD-001
**Density Pattern:** PULSE (Q=sparse, A=dense)
**R-1 Findings:** R1-001, R1-002, R1-003, R1-007, R1-008, R1-010

### OD-002 Narrative Arc (CRESCENDO)
**Status:** VISUAL AUDIT PASSED — Soul compliant, 0 violations
**Score:** ~33/40 (pending visual audit)
**Decision:** INCLUDE
**Build Audit:** Pending
**Guardian:** Pending
**Key Insight:** Narrative arc NATURALLY creates CRESCENDO density — story progression from simple to complex mirrors sparse → dense
**DD Sources:** DD-001, DD-002, DD-006
**Density Pattern:** CRESCENDO (sparse→dense)
**R-1 Findings:** R1-001, R1-003, R1-007, R1-008, R1-016, R1-017, R1-018, R1-019

### OD-003 Task-Based (ISLANDS/BOOKENDS)
**Status:** VISUAL AUDIT PASSED — Soul compliant, 0 violations
**Score:** ~33/40 (pending visual audit)
**Decision:** INCLUDE
**Build Audit:** Pending
**Guardian:** Pending
**Key Insight:** Task-based structure NATURALLY creates ISLANDS density — discrete procedural clusters are inherently dense islands in a sparse sea. BOOKENDS secondary pattern provides orientation (dense front) and verification (dense back).
**DD Sources:** DD-003, DD-006
**Density Pattern:** ISLANDS (primary) + BOOKENDS (secondary)
**R-1 Findings:** R1-001, R1-003, R1-007, R1-008, R1-016, R1-019
**External Research:** EXT-TASK-001 through EXT-TASK-012 (8 applied)

### OD-004 Confidence-Based (GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO)
**Status:** VISUAL AUDIT PASSED — Soul compliant, 0 violations
**Score:** INCLUDE (pending visual audit)
**Decision:** INCLUDE
**Build Audit:** Pending
**Guardian:** Pending
**Key Insight:** Confidence-level organization NATURALLY creates GEOLOGICAL density — established knowledge compresses into bedrock, emerging settles as sediment, exploratory floats as topsoil. Border thickness (4px/2px/1px) and typographic weight (700/400/300) encode certainty without color.
**DD Sources:** DD-002, DD-004, DD-006
**Density Pattern:** GEOLOGICAL (primary) + CRESCENDO (secondary)
**R-1 Findings:** R1-001, R1-003, R1-007, R1-008, R1-016, R1-017, R1-018, R1-019
**External Research:** EXT-CONF-001 through EXT-CONF-012 (12 applied)

### OD-005 Spatial/Map (WAVE + ISLANDS)
**Status:** VISUAL AUDIT PASSED — Soul compliant, 0 violations
**Score:** INCLUDE (pending visual audit)
**Decision:** INCLUDE
**Build Audit:** Pending
**Guardian:** Pending
**Key Insight:** Hub-and-spoke spatial organization NATURALLY creates WAVE density — sparse hub overview oscillates with dense spoke content. Each spoke is a self-contained ISLAND.
**DD Sources:** DD-001, DD-003, DD-006
**Density Pattern:** WAVE (primary) + ISLANDS (secondary)
**R-1 Findings:** R1-001, R1-003, R1-007, R1-008, R1-016, R1-018, R1-019
**External Research:** EXT-SPAT-001 through EXT-SPAT-012 (10 applied)
**Note:** Header finding ID mismatch — R3-005 labeled as WAVE (actually BOOKENDS), R3-007 labeled as ISLANDS (actually Scroll-triggered). Correct IDs: R3-006=WAVE, R3-047=ISLANDS.

### OD-006 Creative/Emergent (ALL PATTERNS — FRACTAL Primary)
**Status:** VISUAL AUDIT PASSED — Soul compliant, 0 violations
**Score:** INCLUDE (crown jewel, targeting >=36/40)
**Decision:** INCLUDE
**Build Audit:** Pending
**Guardian:** Pending
**Key Insight:** Organization IS Density — the organizational pattern does not "create" density, it IS density. Same phenomenon, two perspectives. Proven by meta-documentation that uses all 5 prior OD patterns in sequence, each generating its own density automatically.
**DD Sources:** ALL DD (DD-001 through DD-006)
**Density Pattern:** EMERGENT — all 6 DD patterns synthesized through FRACTAL (primary) + CRESCENDO (secondary)
**R-1 Findings:** R1-001,R1-002,R1-003,R1-004,R1-005,R1-006,R1-007,R1-008,R1-009,R1-010,R1-011,R1-013,R1-015,R1-016,R1-017,R1-018,R1-019,R1-022,R1-025,R1-026 (20 of 28)
**External Research:** EXT-CREATIVE-001 through EXT-CREATIVE-009 (9 of 12 creative techniques)
**New Findings:** OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density), OD-F-006 (Meta-Doc as Purest Test), OD-F-007 (Mode-Transition Breathing), OD-F-008 (Compound Creative Techniques)

## RESEARCH FINDINGS GENERATED

### OD-001 Findings

| Finding ID | Name | Description | Source |
|------------|------|-------------|--------|
| OD-F-001 | Conversational Width Variation | Q&A width difference (60%/100%) creates natural TIDAL rhythm without explicit density annotations | OD-001-conversational.html |
| OD-F-002 | Fractal Nesting via Follow-ups | Follow-up questions create fractal nesting — a conversation within a conversation — satisfying DD-F-006 at section scale | OD-001-conversational.html |
| OD-F-003 | Q&A as Natural PULSE Generator | Q&A pairs are inherent PULSE generators: question=LOW density, answer=HIGH density. No artificial density manipulation needed. | OD-001-conversational.html |
| OD-F-004 | Chapter Dividers as Breathing Zones | Chapter dividers between dense answer sections serve as breathing zones, providing recovery whitespace (R3-048 Density Debt) | OD-001-conversational.html |

### OD-006 Findings

| Finding ID | Name | Description | Source |
|------------|------|-------------|--------|
| OD-F-005 | Organization IS Density | The organizational pattern does not "create" density — it IS density. Same phenomenon observed from two perspectives. Conversational Q&A IS PULSE. Narrative arc IS CRESCENDO. | OD-006-creative.html |
| OD-F-006 | Meta-Documentation as Purest Density Test | Content that IS about density principles creates the most natural density rhythm — no artificial manipulation needed. | OD-006-creative.html |
| OD-F-007 | Mode-Transition Breathing | Switching between organizational modes (Q&A → narrative → task) requires breathing zones to prevent cognitive whiplash. | OD-006-creative.html |
| OD-F-008 | Compound Creative Techniques | Multiple EXT-CREATIVE techniques (solid offset + arriving wisdom + editorial drop + scroll witness) compound when layered — the whole exceeds the sum. | OD-006-creative.html |

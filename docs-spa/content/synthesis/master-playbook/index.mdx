<EssenceBox>
Master AI-assisted development through progressive capability building—from conversation to orchestration.
</EssenceBox>

## Core Abstraction

<CoreAbstraction
  philosophy="The goal is not to use AI more, but to accomplish more with AI as your amplifier."
>
The playbook organizes around capability levels, not features. Each level builds on the previous, creating compound returns on your investment.
</CoreAbstraction>

## Design Decisions

<DesignDecision
  why="Why progressive levels instead of feature categories?"
  reasoning="Features are static; capabilities compound. A developer at Level 3 doesn't just know more—they think differently about problems."
  implication="Focus on leveling up, not collecting techniques."
/>

## Path of a Task

<PathOfTask
  steps={[
    {
      number: 1,
      title: "Define the outcome",
      description: "What does success look like? Be specific about deliverables."
    },
    {
      number: 2,
      title: "Assess complexity",
      description: "Single-turn or multi-turn? Does it need external state?"
    },
    {
      number: 3,
      title: "Choose the pattern",
      description: "Match complexity to the right orchestration level."
    }
  ]}
/>

## Gotchas

<GotchaBox
  symptom="Context window exceeded mid-task"
  why="Long sessions accumulate context faster than you expect."
  stats="Sessions over 50 turns have 3x higher failure rate"
  fix="Use /compact proactively or structure work into smaller chunks."
/>

## What's Hard

<WhatsHard
  tension="The paradox of control vs. autonomy"
  symptoms={[
    "Micromanaging defeats the purpose of AI assistance",
    "Full autonomy without guardrails leads to drift",
    "The right balance changes with task complexity"
  ]}
  mitigation="Start with more control, gradually increase autonomy as trust builds."

## Synthesis: Common Threads

### Typography Characteristics Shared
1. **BOLD IS MANDATORY** - All use extreme weights (700-900)
2. **Condensed is preferred** - Space efficiency creates drama
3. **Size contrast is extreme** - Huge display vs small body
4. **Weight contrast is intentional** - Black for attention, regular for reading
5. **Mixed styles create interest** - Serif + sans, roman + italic

### Color Philosophy Shared
1. **Maximum 3 colors** - Often just 2
2. **High contrast** - No muddy middle tones
3. **One dominant color** - Blue OR Red OR Black
4. **White as structural element** - Not just "empty space"
5. **No gradients** - Flat, decisive color

### Contrast Levels
- All images: MAXIMUM CONTRAST
- No soft edges, no subtle tones
- Everything is either "on" or "off"
- This creates: clarity, authority, memorability

### Personality Traits
| Trait | Blue/White | Sanrok | Nous |
|-------|------------|--------|------|
| Authority | Sacred/Divine | Contemporary/Fashion | Technical/Revolutionary |
| Era | Medieval/Timeless | 2020s/Current | 1980s-Retro/Futurist |
| Density | Sparse/Ceremonial | Dense/Editorial | Dense/Journalistic |
| Energy | Static/Eternal | Dynamic/Confident | Urgent/Activist |

### Unified Design Principles for Documentation

1. **Typography is the hero** - Not images, not colors, TYPOGRAPHY
2. **Be bold or go home** - If it's not immediately striking, it's wrong
3. **Limit the palette** - 2-3 colors maximum
4. **Embrace density** - Information should feel valuable, not sparse
5. **Create hierarchy through WEIGHT** - Black > Bold > Medium > Regular
6. **Decorative elements are intentional** - Ornaments add personality, not noise
7. **Grid creates order** - Even within chaos, alignment matters
8. **Texture adds authenticity** - Halftone, etching, vintage treatments

## Recommended Design Direction for Documentation

### Primary Theme: "Editorial Technical"
Combining Sanrok's contemporary editorial polish with Nous's technical credibility.

### Color Palette
```css
--color-primary: #171717;      /* Near-black (from Sanrok) */
--color-accent: #E23B3B;       /* Muted red (Sanrok-derived) */
--color-background: #FBF5EF;   /* Warm cream (Sanrok) */
--color-surface: #FFFFFF;      /* Pure white for cards */
--color-text: #171717;         /* High contrast body */
--color-text-muted: #666666;   /* Secondary text */
```

### Typography Direction
- **Display:** Barlow Condensed Black (matches Sanrok energy)
- **Body:** Inter (readable, professional)
- **Code:** JetBrains Mono (technical credibility)
- **Accent (optional):** UnifrakturCook for classical touches

### Key Visual Elements to Incorporate
1. Heavy border accents (4-8px for active states)
2. Tight letter-spacing on display type (-0.02em to -0.05em)
3. Mixed weight within single lines
4. Inline icons for navigation
5. Horizontal rules as section dividers
6. Optional: Subtle halftone texture for image treatments

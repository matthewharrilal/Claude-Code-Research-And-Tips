1. Write CLAUDE.md with project context

5. Iterate on implementation
6. Verify with tests/typecheck
7. Update CLAUDE.md with learnings</code></pre>

            <h3><span class="bionic">Key</span> Concepts</h3>

            <h4>Human as PM, AI as Coder</h4>
            <p>Your role fundamentally shifts from "person who writes code" to "product manager who directs agents." You think about features, requirements, acceptance criteria, and user value. The AI thinks about implementation, syntax, and technical details.</p>

            <h4>Throughput Over Perfection</h4>
            <p>Optimize for THROUGHPUT, not perfection. Some bugs get fixed 2-3 times. Some fixes get lost. That's fine. The goal is shipping features, not writing pristine code.</p>

            <h4>Boring Technology Advantage</h4>
            <p>For AI-generated code, "boring" languages outperform exciting ones:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Language</th>
                        <th>Issue</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>TypeScript</td><td>1/3 to 1/2 of diffs are type wrestling</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Python</td><td>"Fine" but feels like scripts</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Go</strong></td><td>"Boring" = evolutionary advantage. Diffs are understandable.</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Colonies Over Individuals</h4>
            <blockquote>"Claude Code is the world's biggest fuckin' ant. Everyone is focused on making their ant run longer... when nature prefers colonies."</blockquote>

            <h3><span class="bionic">Des</span>ire Paths</h3>
            <p>"Desire paths" in UX: watch where people walk across grass, then pave those paths. Applied to AI: watch what agents try to do, then make those things real. Don't design AI systems top-down. Observe emergent agent behavior and formalize what works.</p>

                <h4>The Perfectionist Trap</h4>
                <p>Treating AI output like production code that needs extensive review. For many use cases, "good enough" is the goal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gotcha-block">
                <h4>The Micro-Manager</h4>
                <p>Specifying HOW instead of WHAT. Let the AI figure out implementation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gotcha-block">
                <h4>Context Maximalism</h4>
                <p>"More context is always better." Actually, context rot means lean context often produces better results.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gotcha-block">
                <h4>The Trust Binary</h4>
                <p>Either trusting AI completely or not at all. Build graduated trust through verification.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gotcha-block">
                <h4>Tool Obsession</h4>
                <p>Chasing the newest orchestration tool when fundamentals aren't mastered. Stage 3 developers trying Stage 8 tools.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gotcha-block">
                <h4>Prompt Magic Thinking</h4>
                <p>Believing the "right prompt" will fix everything. Structured context beats clever prompts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gotcha-block">
                <h4>Human Loop Addiction</h4>
                <p>Requiring human approval for every action. Build verification systems that let agents run autonomously.</p>

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## Repository Purpose

This is a **Claude Code research and mastery knowledge base** - a curated library documenting Claude Code workflows, patterns, orchestration techniques, and community innovations. It distills insights from:

- 150+ cataloged sources (GitHub, Twitter, YouTube, blogs, official docs)
- 40+ community thought leaders and power users
- Official Anthropic documentation and creator Boris Cherny's philosophy

**This is a documentation repository.** There is no code to build, test, or deploy.

## Core Concepts

**Patterns:**
- **Ralph Wiggum Loop** - `while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude-code ; done` for continuous iteration
- **Gas Town** - Steve Yegge's agent factory (Mayor, Deacon, Dogs, Refinery)
- **CC Mirror** - Hidden multi-agent orchestration enablement
- **Personal Panopticon** - 8 parallel Claude instances managing life domains

**Frameworks:**
- **8 Core Principles** - Context as constraint, external state > internal memory, fresh context > extended sessions, etc.
- **Complexity Ladder** - Level 0 (single session) → Level 7 (factory-scale autonomous)
- **8-Stage Developer Evolution** - From basic prompting to orchestration architect

**Key Thinkers:**
- Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) - Vanilla workflow, verification loops
- Steve Yegge - Gas Town, 6 Waves of AI
- Matt Pocock / Ryan Carson - Ralph pattern evolution
- Molly Cantillon - Personal Panopticon architecture

{WORLD_DESCRIPTION}

You are about to derive the creative conviction for a page that does not yet exist. You will read the content, inhabit the world described above, and produce a conviction brief that makes a builder WANT to create this page.

You are not planning. You are not specifying. You are FEELING what this page should be — and then articulating that feeling precisely enough that a fresh Claude, reading your brief for the first time, inherits your conviction without needing your reasoning.

## THE CONTENT

Read this content completely. Do not skim. Let it create a processing state — a feeling for what it IS, what it wants to BECOME, and where the tension lives between those two things.

## RESEARCH CONTEXT

These research files provide the creative vocabulary of the design system. They are not instructions — they are the accumulated intelligence of hundreds of exploration hours. Let them inform what compositional strategies might serve THIS content. Do not apply them generically.

## YOUR TASK

Produce a conviction brief of 80-165 lines. This brief will be read by every builder and verifier who touches this page. It is the single most influential document in the pipeline.

### What the brief must contain:

**1. World-Description (3-5 lines)**
How this specific content extends or particularizes the KortAI world. Not a restatement — a FOCUS. "This page lives in the part of the KortAI world where..."

**2. Opposition (5-10 lines)**
The central creative tension in this content. Every page has one. It might be between complexity and accessibility, between authority and invitation, between density and breathing room. Name it. Articulate both sides. Do not resolve it — the tension IS the creative energy the builder will harness.

**3. Metaphor (10-20 lines)**
A structural metaphor derived from the content itself. Not imposed — DISCOVERED. The metaphor should organize the page's spatial logic: what comes first, what goes deep, what resolves. Name it in concrete terms. Show how it maps to the content's actual structure.

The metaphor must be STRUCTURAL, not decorative. It shapes the page's zones, density arc, and transition logic. It does not name CSS classes or produce visible labels.

**4. Arc (10-20 lines)**
What the reader should FEEL at each stage of the scroll. Not what they should learn — what they should feel. Opening → development → peak → resolution → closure. Describe the emotional and perceptual journey.

**5. Content Map (15-30 lines)**
How the content's actual sections, headings, and structural elements map onto the metaphor and arc. This is where conviction meets logistics. Which content sections form which zones? Where are the natural density peaks? Where does the content breathe?

**6. Mechanism Affinity (10-15 lines)**
Which compositional mechanisms from the design system vocabulary naturally serve this content's needs. Not all 18 — the 6-8 that resonate with the opposition and metaphor. Name them. Say WHY they serve this content, not just that they do.

**7. What This Page Is NOT (5-10 lines)**
The creative roads NOT to take. The traps this content sets. The easy versions that would satisfy the content without honoring it. Name them explicitly so the builder can avoid them.

### Quality test

After writing your brief, read it back as if you are a fresh Claude who has never seen this content. Does the brief make you WANT to build this page? Can you FEEL the opposition? Does the metaphor organize your spatial thinking? If not, revise until it does.

### Output format

Write the conviction brief directly. No preamble, no meta-commentary. Start with the world-description section and end with the "what this page is not" section. The brief is the only output.

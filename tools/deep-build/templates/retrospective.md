You are reflecting on a completed subset of corpus integration passes. Your job is to synthesize what happened — what deepened, what stagnated, what emerged — into a brief that carries forward to the next subset's builders.

You are not auditing. You are not scoring. You are creating a 3-sentence summary that conveys the creative STATE of the artifact at this point in its evolution. A fresh builder reading your summary should understand where the page IS, what it WANTS TO BECOME, and what creative territory remains unclaimed.

## VERIFIER OBSERVATIONS FROM THIS SUBSET

These are the holistic observations from verifiers who checked corpus integration at passes 2, 5, and 8 of this subset. Notice the trajectory — is integration deepening, broadening, or flattening?

## ARTIFACT EVOLUTION

How the artifact changed during this subset:

## ACCUMULATED CREATIVE TISSUE

The conviction layer contains compressed creative reflections from all builders who have touched the artifact so far. Read for patterns — which creative directions persist? Which ones were tried and abandoned?

## YOUR TASK

Produce exactly 3 sentences:

**Sentence 1: STATE** — What the artifact IS right now. Its strongest quality, its dominant character, the overall impression it makes. Be specific — "the density arc peaks convincingly in zone 3 with compressed callouts and tightened borders" not "the page has good density variation."

**Sentence 2: DIRECTION** — Where the artifact is HEADING. Based on the trajectory visible in verifier observations and conviction layer entries, what creative direction is emerging? Is the metaphor deepening or stalling? Are mechanisms in conversation or isolated?

**Sentence 3: TERRITORY** — What creative territory remains UNCLAIMED. The most promising opportunity the next subset's builders should explore. Name the specific opportunity — "the relationship between code blocks and surrounding prose has not yet been shaped by the conviction's opposition between precision and warmth" — not "there's room for improvement."

### Quality test

Read your 3 sentences as a fresh builder about to start the next subset. Do you understand:
- What you're walking into? (Sentence 1)
- What momentum to continue? (Sentence 2)
- Where your creative energy should go? (Sentence 3)

If any answer is no, revise.

### Output format

Write exactly 3 sentences. No preamble, no framing, no bullet points. Three sentences, each doing its specific job.

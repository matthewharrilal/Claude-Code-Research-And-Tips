## STATUS: SUPERSEDED — Historical Record Only

**DO NOT USE THIS FOLDER FOR NEW WORK.**

This folder contains the original card-focused design exploration that was superseded by component-system/ and then by perceptual-audit-v2/. It exists as historical record of the soul's evolution.

## What This Folder Contains

The original "card system" design work:
- **SOUL-DEFINITION.md** — 10 card-scope principles (SUPERSEDED by 6 universal rules)
- **research/** — 3A-3D research files (historical value)
- **experiments/** — Card layout experiments
- **css/** — Card-specific CSS (outdated)
- **assets/** — Patterns and test images (mostly SUPERSEDED)

## Why This Exists

In early phases, we explored a "card-based" approach to documentation. This produced:
1. 10 soul principles specific to cards
2. Research into card anatomy, halftone techniques, editorial patterns
3. CSS experiments for card layouts

We later realized the soul principles applied to ALL components, not just cards. This led to:
- `component-system/SOUL-DEFINITION.md` (6 universal rules)
- `perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md` (5 soul pieces)

The evolution: 10 card principles → 6 universal rules → 5 soul pieces

## Pipeline Position

```
[CARD-SYSTEM] → component-system/ → perceptual-audit-v2/ → T1 Synthesis
  (historical)    (intermediate)       (current)            (authoritative)
```

This folder is BEFORE the current pipeline — it's where soul thinking began.

## Constraints (Read Before Modifying Anything)

- **DO NOT use any values from this folder** — They are outdated
- **DO NOT reference SOUL-DEFINITION.md** — It's SUPERSEDED (has header)
- **DO NOT use CSS from css/** — Outdated values
- **DO NOT use paper-texture.svg** — It's SUPERSEDED
- **READ ONLY** — This folder is frozen as historical record

**For current soul:** Use `../component-system/perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md`
**For current tokens:** Use `../component-system/perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/DESIGN-TOKEN-SUMMARY.md`

## Upstream Sources

- Original design screenshots and Sanrok reference material
- Early design system brainstorming and card layout experiments

## Downstream Consumers

- `../component-system/SOUL-DEFINITION.md` — Evolved from 10 card principles to 6 universal rules
- `../component-system/perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md` — Final evolution to 5 soul pieces

## Supersession Chain

```
card-system/SOUL-DEFINITION.md (10 principles)
    ↓ SUPERSEDED BY
component-system/SOUL-DEFINITION.md (6 universal rules)
    ↓ SYNTHESIZED INTO
perceptual-audit-v2/synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md (5 soul pieces) ← AUTHORITATIVE
```

## For Context Recovery

**Status:** SUPERSEDED (entire folder)
**Action:** Do not modify, do not use for new work
**Value:** Historical record of soul evolution

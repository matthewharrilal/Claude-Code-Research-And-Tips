# REFERENCE A: KortAI Page Layout — Perceptual Analysis

**Source:** User-provided screenshot (REFERENCE-IMAGE-KORTAI-PAGE-LAYOUT.png)
**Analyzed:** 2026-02-03
**Analysis Type:** Direct perceptual observation

---

## FIRST IMPRESSION (3-Second Test)

What I see immediately:
- **Dominant element:** Large hero halftone image spanning full width
- **Color mood:** Blue/purple/lavender — cool, professional, data-like
- **Feeling:** "Financial dashboard meets artistic data visualization"
- **Density:** HIGH but ORGANIZED — lots of information compartmentalized cleanly

### Section Count: 5 Distinct Sections
1. Header (navigation)
2. Hero image (full-width halftone)
3. Title + tagline
4. Navigation tabs
5. Card carousel (horizontal scroll)

### Compartmentalization Style
- **Boundary type:** Whitespace + subtle shadows
- **Separation method:** Clean horizontal divisions
- **Feeling:** "Organized filing cabinet" — everything has its place

## HALFTONE TREATMENT ANALYSIS (Critical)

### What I See in the Hero Image

**Dot Characteristics:**
- Dots are CLEARLY VISIBLE at this viewing distance
- I can perceive individual dots without zooming
- Dots create SWIRLING, TOPOGRAPHIC patterns
- Like looking at weather radar or data visualization art

**Dot Size Variation:**
- In DARK areas (shadows): Dots are LARGE, densely packed, almost merging
- In LIGHT areas (sky, highlights): Dots are TINY or ABSENT
- The variation is CONTINUOUS — not stepped, smooth gradation

**Color:**
- Monochrome blue/purple palette
- NOT duotone (not two distinct colors mixing)
- Single color with luminance creating all tonal variation

**Interior Porosity:**
- In light areas, the WHITE BACKGROUND shows through
- Creates that "printed on paper" feeling
- Light areas feel like "gaps in the ink" not "white ink"

**Process Visibility Score:** 5/5 — The halftone IS the aesthetic, not hidden

### What I See in the Card Images

Same treatment applied at smaller scale:
- Left card: Landscape/field scene — blue halftone, dots visible
- Middle card: Abstract graph/wave pattern — dots create data-viz feel
- Right card: Feather/organic shape — dots follow contours beautifully

**Named Character for Image Treatment:** "The Data Topographer"
- Feels like elevation maps rendered as halftone
- Scientific yet artistic
- Precise yet organic

```

### Zone Count: 7 distinct zones
### Zone Separation Method: Whitespace (no lines, subtle spatial grouping)
### Internal Density: DENSE but STRUCTURED — many elements, clear hierarchy
### Internal Hierarchy: Image → Progress → Title → Metadata

---

## MULTI-AXIS MOVEMENT ANALYSIS

**Vertical Movement:**
- Page scrolls vertically (standard)
- Sections stack top-to-bottom

**Horizontal Movement:**
- Card carousel scrolls HORIZONTALLY
- Creates "multi-axis movement" — vertical page with horizontal section
- Feeling: "Gallery browsing within a dashboard"

**Movement Feeling:** NATURAL — horizontal scroll feels expected for cards, not disorienting

---

## TYPOGRAPHY OBSERVATIONS

### Hero Section Typography
- "Real Insights Financial Reports" — Large, italic, serif
- Feels editorial, magazine-like
- NOT aggressive, NOT uppercase

### Card Typography
- Title: "London Stock Exchange" — Medium weight, sans-serif, sentence case
- Body: Small, light weight, gray
- Metadata: Icons + small text, very restrained

### Typography Restraint Score: 4/5
- Clean, hierarchy through size not decoration
- No color emphasis on text (all dark gray/black)
- Italics used sparingly (hero only)

## 10 SOUL PIECES ASSESSMENT

| # | Soul Piece | Score | Observation |
|---|------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Visible Process | 5/5 | Halftone dots are THE feature, clearly countable |
| 2 | Material Presence | 4/5 | Feels printed, like data-viz poster |
| 3 | Constraint as Identity | 4/5 | "Blue halftone on white" is the system |
| 4 | Image as Foundation | 4/5 | Images dominate but serve data story |
| 5 | Typography Restraint | 4/5 | Clean, hierarchical, not shouting |
| 6 | Interior Porosity | 5/5 | White shows through light areas beautifully |
| 7 | Earned Imperfection | 4/5 | Dot variation creates organic texture |
| 8 | Organized Density | 5/5 | HIGH info density, perfectly structured |
| 9 | Multi-Axis Movement | 5/5 | Horizontal cards within vertical page |
| 10 | Internal Card Structure | 5/5 | 7 clear zones, dense but readable |

**Total Soul Alignment:** 45/50 (90%)

## NAMED CHARACTERS

**Page Character:** "The Financial Data Gallery"
- Professional yet artful
- Dense information presented as curated exhibition
- Science meets aesthetics

**Card Character:** "The Investment Module"
- Self-contained information unit
- Dashboard tile with artistic image treatment
- Designed for SCANNING, not LINGERING

**Image Treatment Character:** "The Data Topographer"
- Halftone as elevation map
- Abstract data visualized as terrain
- Process as aesthetic

---

## KEY PERCEPTUAL TRUTHS (After Observation)

### Truth 1: Halftone Creates "Data as Art"
The halftone treatment transforms financial imagery into something that feels like data visualization art. The swirling dot patterns evoke topographic maps, weather systems, or abstract data flows.

**Test:** Does the image feel like "art about data" or "filtered photo"?
**Anti-pattern:** Smooth gradients would feel like Instagram filters

### Truth 2: Density Requires Structure
KortAI achieves HIGH density (7 zones per card, multiple data points) WITHOUT overwhelm because every element has a clear position. The structure contains the density.

**Test:** Can I scan a card in 3 seconds and know what it shows?
**Anti-pattern:** Density without structure becomes chaos

### Truth 3: Horizontal Scroll Enables Density
The horizontal card carousel allows dense cards to exist without vertical crush. Each card has breathing room because you scroll horizontally to see more.

**Test:** Would stacking these cards vertically feel overwhelming?
**Anti-pattern:** Dense cards in tight vertical grids

### Truth 4: Monochrome Halftone is the Constraint
The blue/purple monochrome palette IS the identity. Not duotone (two colors), not full color — single color varying by luminance through dot size.

**Test:** Can I identify "KortAI style" from the image treatment alone?
**Anti-pattern:** Multiple duotone colors per card (that's Paper Theme's territory)

## COMPARISON CRITERIA EXTRACTED

For Experiment 1 (Visible Process), a successful halftone must show:
- [ ] Variable dot size responding to image luminance
- [ ] Dots visible and countable at arm's length
- [ ] White/cream background showing through in light areas
- [ ] "Data visualization" or "topographic" feeling
- [ ] Monochrome, not duotone

For Experiment 6 (Layout), successful page structure must show:
- [ ] Clear section compartmentalization
- [ ] Horizontal scroll for card browsing
- [ ] HIGH density ORGANIZED by structure
- [ ] Multi-axis movement that feels natural

---

## BLINDSPOT CHECK

**What I might be missing:**
- How does this scale to mobile? (horizontal scroll on small screens)
- What happens with poor-quality source images?
- Is the 7-zone card structure necessary or excessive for our use case?

**What made me uncomfortable:**
- The high information density — our current system is much sparser
- The dashboard-like organization — ours feels more editorial

**Investigation needed:**
- Experiment 4 will clarify: Are we building dashboard modules or editorial cards?

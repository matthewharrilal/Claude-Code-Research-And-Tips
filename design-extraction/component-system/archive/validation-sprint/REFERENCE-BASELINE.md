# REFERENCE BASELINE — VALIDATION SPRINT

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Purpose:** Establish perceptual truth from reference images before any experimentation.

---

## REFERENCE A: KortAI Financial Dashboard

### Overall Impression

The KortAI cards feel like **dashboard modules designed for professional scanning**. They communicate "organized data" more than "artistic object." The halftone treatment makes the images feel like **sophisticated data visualizations** rather than filtered photographs.

---

### Zone-by-Zone Analysis

#### Typography — "The Dashboard Narrator"

**What I perceive:**
- Clean sans-serif text, hierarchical through size not decoration
- Dark text on light backgrounds, high readability
- No competing emphasis — information organized, not shouted
- Labels are quiet, metadata is present but unobtrusive

**Named character:** The Dashboard Narrator — speaks clearly, prioritizes information over expression.

---

#### Spacing — "The Organized Module"

**What I perceive:**
- High information density within each card
- Consistent internal gutters creating rhythm
- Space is **functional**, not expressive — it separates concerns
- Tight but readable, maximizing information per card

**Named character:** The Organized Module — efficient use of space, professional density.

---

#### Containers — "The Soft White Card"

**What I perceive:**
- White backgrounds making cards visible as distinct objects
- Rounded corners creating friendly, approachable feeling
- Subtle shadows lifting cards from background
- Clear card boundaries, each card is a bounded unit

**Named character:** The Soft White Card — the container is visible and friendly.

---

#### Hierarchy — "Image First, Data Below"

**What I perceive:**
- Eye lands on the halftone image immediately (top position, dominant size)
- Then flows down to title
- Then to metadata (dates, progress, collaborators)
- Clear top-to-bottom reading flow

**Named character:** Image First, Data Below — image captures attention, text elaborates.

---

#### Composition — "The Information Tile"

**What I perceive:**
- Static, organized feeling — designed for scanning many cards at once
- No dramatic tension or asymmetry
- Modularity over individuality
- Cards work as a system more than as individual objects

**Named character:** The Information Tile — designed for collection, not isolation.

---

#### Image Treatment — "The Variable Dither"

**What I perceive:**
- Blue/purple monochrome palette
- Halftone dots that **vary in size** with image luminance
- In light areas: small dots or no dots (white shows through)
- In dark areas: large dots that merge together
- Creates swirling, topographic, data-visualization patterns
- Dots are **countable** at arm's length — I can see individual circles
- The pattern feels like computer-printed halftone, mechanical but intentional

**Named character:** The Variable Dither — dots reveal the image's tonal structure.

**Critical observation:** The dots are NOT uniform. Their size responds to the image. This is what makes it feel like "printed image" rather than "pattern over image."

---

### KortAI Signature Constraints

1. Blue/purple MONOCHROME (not duotone with two colors)
2. Dots VARY with luminance (true halftone reproduction)
3. Image at TOP, approximately 60% of card height
4. HIGH information density below image
5. Cards feel like "dashboard modules" meant for SCANNING
6. White backgrounds, rounded corners, subtle shadows

---

### What Makes KortAI Feel Like KortAI

**In perceptual terms:**
- The halftone creates **visual texture that reveals process** without overwhelming content
- The data-dense layout communicates **professional utility**
- The soft container style says **"approachable dashboard"** not "art gallery"
- The variable dots feel like **sophisticated printing**, not Instagram filter

---

## REFERENCE B: Paper Theme (Japan/Brazil Series)

### Overall Impression

The Paper cards feel like **collectible art prints designed for admiration**. They communicate "treasure this" more than "scan this." The halftone treatment makes the images feel like **risograph posters** you could frame.

---

### Zone-by-Zone Analysis

#### Typography — "The Museum Label"

**What I perceive:**
- Minimal text, almost absent
- Just a title in the corner, like a museum plaque
- Typography as annotation, not information delivery
- The text says "here's what this is" then gets out of the way

**Named character:** The Museum Label — minimal, deferential, annotation not content.

---

#### Spacing — "The Gallery Wall"

**What I perceive:**
- Generous space between cards
- Content breathes, not crowded
- Image commands space, other elements minimal
- White space is **expressive**, not functional

**Named character:** The Gallery Wall — space creates reverence, not efficiency.

---

#### Containers — "The Art Print"

**What I perceive:**
- Sharp corners, no rounded edges
- No shadows, no visible container chrome
- Image IS the card — container disappears
- Feels like looking at a print, not a UI element

**Named character:** The Art Print — the container vanishes, only the image matters.

---

#### Hierarchy — "Pure Image"

**What I perceive:**
- Eye never leaves the image — it dominates completely
- Text is peripheral, barely noticed
- No competing elements
- The image IS the content

**Named character:** Pure Image — everything else is secondary.

---

#### Composition — "The Collectible Poster"

**What I perceive:**
- Static but immersive
- Designed for **admiration**, not scanning
- Each card is a standalone object
- Could hang on a wall

**Named character:** The Collectible Poster — individual objects meant for appreciation.

---

#### Image Treatment — "The Risograph Master"

**What I perceive:**
- TRUE halftone with VERY LARGE, COARSE dots
- Dots are **extremely countable** — like newspaper print
- Cream/off-white background **shows through dramatically** in light areas
- Different duotone color per card:
  - Blue/cream for Geisha
  - Green/cream for Himeji Castle
  - Red/cream for Mt. Fuji
  - Sepia/cream for Brazil
- The subject is rendered THROUGH the dots, not over them
- Feels like **risograph prints** or vintage Japanese posters

**Named character:** The Risograph Master — coarse dots create tactile, printed feel.

**Critical observation:** The cream background infiltrating light areas is ESSENTIAL. This is **interior porosity** — the paper shows through the image, making it feel printed ON the surface.

---

### Paper Theme Signature Constraints

1. DIFFERENT duotone color per card (constraint creates variety)
2. Dots are LARGE and COARSE — definitely countable
3. Image fills 90%+ of card — image IS the card
4. Sharp corners, NO shadows, NO container chrome
5. Typography is MINIMAL — annotation, not content
6. Cream background SHOWS THROUGH everywhere in light areas
7. Cards feel like "collectible art prints" not UI components

---

### What Makes Paper Feel Like Paper

**In perceptual terms:**
- The coarse halftone creates **tactile presence** — you imagine holding paper
- The cream showing through makes images feel **printed ON a surface**
- The minimal typography lets images **command complete attention**
- The color variation creates **collection appeal** without breaking system
- The sharp corners say **"editorial precision"** not "friendly app"

---

## COMMON THREADS — What Both References Share

### 1. VARIABLE DOT SIZE (Critical)

Both KortAI and Paper use halftone where **dot size varies with image luminance**:
- Dark areas → Large dots
- Light areas → Small dots or no dots
- Creates the feeling of "image reproduced through halftone process"

This is DIFFERENT from pattern overlay (uniform dots) which creates "pattern applied over image."

### 2. COUNTABLE MECHANISM

In both references, I can see and count individual dots at arm's length. The mechanism is **visible**, not hidden. This is the "Visible Process" soul piece.

### 3. BACKGROUND SHOWS THROUGH

Both references show the background (white in KortAI, cream in Paper) **infiltrating light areas of the image**. This is "Interior Porosity" — the surface shows through the sparse dot areas.

### 4. IMAGE IS PRIMARY

In both references, the image commands most of the attention. Whether 60% (KortAI) or 90% (Paper), the image is the primary element, not supporting decoration.

### 5. PROCESS EVOKES PHYSICAL REPRODUCTION

Both treatments make you imagine a physical printing process. You can imagine "how this was made" — whether computer-generated halftone (KortAI) or risograph press (Paper).

## KEY DIVERGENCES — How References Differ

| Aspect | KortAI | Paper Theme | Soul Alignment |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Information Density | HIGH (metrics, dates, progress) | VERY LOW (just title) | TBD in Experiment 4 |
| Image Dominance | ~60% of card | ~90% of card | Paper aligns more with "Image as Foundation" |
| Typography Volume | Present but restrained | Almost absent | Paper aligns more with "Typography Restraint" |
| Container Style | Rounded, shadows, white | Sharp, no chrome, cream | **Paper aligns with our soul (sharp edges)** |
| Card Purpose | SCANNING dashboard modules | ADMIRING collectible prints | TBD in Experiment 4 |
| Overall Mood | Professional, institutional | Artistic, museum-like | Depends on use case |
| Color Approach | Single color (blue) | Different color per card | Paper's constraint creates variety |

## COMPARISON CRITERIA — What Success Looks Like

Based on reference observation, a successful prototype must show:

### From Both References
- [ ] VARIABLE dot size (dots respond to image luminance)
- [ ] Countable dots at arm's length (mechanism visible)
- [ ] Background infiltrating light areas (interior porosity)
- [ ] Image dominance (60%+ of visual attention)
- [ ] "Printed" feeling, not "filtered photograph"

### From Paper (Aligns with Our Soul)
- [ ] Sharp corners (editorial precision)
- [ ] Minimal container chrome (transparent/invisible container)
- [ ] Coarse enough dots to feel tactile
- [ ] Cream/warm background showing through

### From KortAI (Aligns with Dashboard Use)
- [ ] Room for metadata below image
- [ ] Professional, organized feeling
- [ ] Scannable in grids

---

## CRITICAL INSIGHT: THE HALFTONE FUNDAMENTAL

**What makes reference halftones work:**
The dots don't just MASK an image — they BECOME the image through size variation. This is the difference between:

1. **Pattern overlay** (our CSS mask) — Same size dots everywhere, image shows through holes
2. **True halftone** (references) — Dot SIZE varies with luminance, creating tonal reproduction

**Technical implication:**
CSS masks cannot achieve variable dot sizes. True halftone requires image processing:
- Server-side (Sharp, Jimp)
- Canvas-based (client-side pixel manipulation)
- WebGL shaders
- Pre-processed images

This is a **fundamental technical constraint** that may require scope adjustment.

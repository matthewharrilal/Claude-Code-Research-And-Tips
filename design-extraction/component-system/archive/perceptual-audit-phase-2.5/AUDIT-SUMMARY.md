# PERCEPTUAL DEEPENING PROTOCOL
## Audit Summary — Card System Soul Extraction

*Complete. Ready for Review.*

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Perceptual Deepening Protocol has extracted **7 soul pieces** from analysis of the current card system and two reference sets (KortAI financial dashboard, Paper theme Japan/Brazil series).

### The Core Finding

**The current system is editorial in INTENT but digital in EXECUTION.**

It uses warm colors, serif typography, and duotone treatment — all correct references. But it implements them with CSS blend modes that create smooth, invisible transformations. The references achieve their power through **visible process** (halftone dots), **material presence** (paper infiltration), and **constrained character** (single-color limitation).

**The gap cannot be closed through CSS refinement. It requires a fundamentally different technical approach.**

## THE 7 SOUL PIECES

| # | Soul Piece | Perceptual Truth | Gap Status |
|---|------------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | **Visible Process** | Images feel PRINTED not FILTERED — dots show the HOW | FULL GAP |
| 2 | **Material Presence** | Design feels like it could be held — ink on paper | PARTIAL |
| 3 | **Constraint as Identity** | Rigid unusual constraints become the brand | PARTIAL |
| 4 | **Image as Foundation** | Image is gravitational center, content descends from it | FULL GAP |
| 5 | **Typography Restraint** | Authority through position, not emphasis stacking | FULL GAP |
| 6 | **Interior Porosity** | Background infiltrates image through granular gaps | FULL GAP |
| 7 | **Earned Imperfection** | Controlled variation (3-15%) signals handmade | FULL GAP |

## KEY NAMED CHARACTERS

### Current System
- Typography: **"The Eager Art School Graduate"** — RED + ITALIC + UPPERCASE, trying too hard
- Image Treatment: **"The CSS Duotone"** — Instagram filter that went to art school
- Composition: **"The Vertical Stack"** — HTML flow, not designed arrangement

### Reference Aspirations
- KortAI Typography: **"The Confident CFO"** — doesn't need to shout
- Paper Image Treatment: **"Trustworthy Imperfection"** — visible craft
- Paper Composition: **"The Bold Exhibitionist"** — image dominates unapologetically

---

## PRIORITY ORDER

```
P0: FOUNDATIONAL (Enables everything else)
├── Visible Process — keystone
├── Interior Porosity — inseparable from visible process
└── Earned Imperfection — warmth generator

P1: HIGH IMPACT (After foundations)
├── Material Presence — emerges from P0
└── Image as Foundation — structural change

P2: REFINEMENT (Polish)
├── Constraint as Identity — strengthen visibility
└── Typography Restraint — reduce emphasis
```

---

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Recommended Path
1. **CSS Mask halftone** (rapid validation) → verify dots visible
2. **Image position flip** (composition change) → verify eye lands on image
3. **Typography reduction** (remove 2 of 3 emphases) → verify calm rhythm
4. **Single-color constraint** (if halftone succeeds) → verify 3-second identification

### Technical Requirements
- SVG filters OR CSS mask-image with dot patterns OR preprocessed images
- New card variant for image-led composition
- Typography CSS adjustments
- Constraint system (color per content type?)

## VERIFICATION TESTS (For Implementation)

### Foundation Tests (After halftone)
- [ ] Can I see dots at arm's length?
- [ ] Does cream show through in light image areas?
- [ ] Does image feel "printed" not "filtered"?

### Composition Tests (After position flip)
- [ ] Does eye land on image first?
- [ ] Does image claim 40%+ of card?
- [ ] Does content feel like elaboration of image?

### Refinement Tests (After typography change)
- [ ] Is typography calm across a grid?
- [ ] Can I identify constraint in 3 seconds?
- [ ] Can I complete "This system always ___"?

---

## STOP POINT

**Implementation should NOT proceed until this audit is reviewed and approved.**

Questions for audit review:
1. Are the 7 soul pieces correctly identified?
2. Is the gap analysis accurate?
3. Is the priority order appropriate?
4. Is the implementation approach sound?
5. Are there blindspots we still haven't examined?

---

## NEXT STEPS (After Approval)

1. Approve soul pieces and gap analysis
2. Confirm implementation priority
3. Choose halftone technical approach
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Run perceptual verification tests
6. Iterate based on results

## THE KORTAI SOUL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Statement

> **"KortAI is the Unhurried Editor — a senior professional at a premium publication who has nothing to prove. Every design choice reflects editorial calm, confident restraint, and trust in the reader's intelligence. We treat web content like magazine content: curated, intentional, and authoritative."**

### Core Philosophy

KortAI rejects the aesthetic convergence of modern web frameworks. Where Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Material Design optimize for "safe" and "universally acceptable," KortAI optimizes for "memorable" and "opinionated."

| Generic Web Philosophy | KortAI Editorial Philosophy |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Components are containers | Content defines its own space |
| Decoration creates interest | Typography creates interest |
| Rounded corners signal friendliness | Sharp edges signal confidence |
| Shadows create depth | Flatness honors print heritage |
| Color coding conveys meaning | Language conveys meaning |
| Everything fits in boxes | Content breathes freely |

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## THE 6 UNIVERSAL RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Rule 1: Sharp Edges (ALWAYS)
```css
border-radius: 0; /* LOCKED — No exceptions */
```
**Soul Impact:** Sharp edges communicate decisiveness and confidence. Rounded corners signal "friendly" and "safe" — which means forgettable. Editorial design is opinionated.

### Rule 2: Flat Design (ALWAYS)
```css
box-shadow: none; /* LOCKED — No exceptions */
```
**Soul Impact:** Shadows create fake 3D depth — a lie about the medium. Web content is flat. Print is flat. Editorial design honors this truth.

### Rule 3: Limited Palette
```css
--color-primary: #E83025;      /* LOCKED — Sanrok red */
--color-background: #FEF9F5;   /* LOCKED — Warm cream */
--color-text: #1A1A1A;         /* LOCKED — Near-black */
```
**Soul Impact:** Limited palette forces restraint. Every use of red becomes meaningful because it's the ONLY accent. Color coding with red/yellow/green is kindergarten-level communication.

### Rule 4: Typography Hierarchy
```css
--font-display: 'Instrument Serif', Georgia, serif;  /* Headlines */
--font-body: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;         /* Reading */
--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', 'SF Mono', monospace; /* Code */
```
**Soul Impact:** The serif/sans tension creates visual rhythm. Serif carries authority (editorials, books). Sans carries clarity (modern, readable). Together they create sophisticated hierarchy.

### Rule 5: Heavy Borders When Bordered
```css
border: 3px solid var(--color-primary);  /* Commit to it */
border-left: 4px solid var(--color-primary);  /* Or single-side accent */
```
**Soul Impact:** If you're going to have a border, commit to it. 1px borders signal uncertainty. Editorial design is confident.

### Rule 6: Whitespace as Design Element
```css
padding: 24px 32px;   /* Generous */
margin: 32px 0;       /* Room to breathe */
line-height: 1.6;     /* Comfortable reading */
```
**Soul Impact:** Whitespace is not empty space — it's a design element. It creates focus, guides the eye, and signals that someone cared.

## PERCEPTUAL TRUTHS BY COMPONENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Code Snippet — The Precise Transcriptionist (49/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Code Snippet feels like a scholar's precise transcription — dark slate for focus, syntax colors as semantic marginalia, generous breathing room for contemplation, and a single silent gesture (copy) that says 'take this knowledge with you.' It presents code without commentary, trusts the reader's intelligence, and achieves authority through accuracy rather than decoration."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Code Snippet's structure feels like a dark window into a technical workspace — two simple zones (label + content) create an inverted editorial space where the dark mass says 'this is different, pay attention' while internal organization remains invisible, trusting the code to speak for itself."

**Zone Truths:**
- Typography: "Focused editor window at 2AM — quiet chrome, semantic colors"
- Spacing: "Museum label — generous but purposeful"
- Container: "Slate writing surface on cream desk"
- Hierarchy: "Museum exhibit where artifact (code) is spotlit"

---

### Info Callout — The Senior Concierge (53/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "The Info Callout is a helpful aside that prioritizes function over personality — it whispers 'read this' without making a statement about who it is. Competent utility elevated through editorial typography."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Info Callout's structure feels like a sticky note placed in the margin of a quality book — the left border is the flag tab, the label is the category written at the top, and the content is the note itself. Two simple zones (label + body) create a polite interruption."

---

### Tip Callout — The Seasoned Colleague (49/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Tip Callout feels like a calm sidebar whisper — visually present enough to catch attention, restrained enough to not interrupt the reading flow, anchored firmly on the left like a trusted guide pointing gently at something useful."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Tip Callout shares Info Callout's exact structural DNA — the only difference is green accent color. Structure creates the callout family identity; color creates semantic differentiation."

---

### Gotcha Callout — The Vigilant Sentinel (51/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Gotcha Callout functions as a velocity gate rather than a warning box — it briefly interrupts reading momentum, injects critical information, and releases the reader back to their original flow. The red border is a speed bump, not a stop sign."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Gotcha Callout shares the callout family structural DNA — red/coral accent creates urgency without panic. Optional pink background tint adds semantic emphasis."

---

### Essence Callout — The Archivist of Axioms (54/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Essence Callout composition feels like a marginalia note in a first-edition book — the red bar is the careful underline of a previous reader marking 'THIS is the important part,' the italic text leans forward with quiet conviction, and the surrounding whitespace creates reverent space around wisdom worth preserving."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Essence Callout is the UNIQUE exception in the callout family — while sharing the same zone structure (label + body), the body zone uses SERIF ITALIC typography instead of sans-serif. This creates editorial pull-quote prominence through typography alone, making it the most KortAI-aligned callout."

**Typography Exception:** Only callout with serif body text.

---

### Challenge Callout — The Spirited Catalyst (52/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Challenge Callout feels like a friendly mentor tapping your shoulder with an interesting exercise — noticeable but not interruptive, actionable but not urgent. The purple accent invites exploration while the italic serif title leans forward with enthusiasm, not demand."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Challenge Callout shares the callout family structural DNA — purple accent invites exploration and action."

---

### File Tree — The Methodical Surveyor (52/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "File Tree feels like a well-organized library card catalog — every item has one exact location, the path to any resource is immediately traceable, and the system trusts you to navigate without hand-holding. It's a reference tool, not a discovery interface."

**Structural Truth:**
> "File Tree's structure feels like a librarian's handwritten index card — monospace characters create a precise vertical alignment where indentation IS the hierarchy, ASCII connectors ARE the relationships, and the whole thing trusts the reader to parse structure through position rather than decoration. It's typography as architecture."

---

### Decision Matrix — The Impartial Cartographer (48.5/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Decision Matrix feels like a well-organized reference index in a design annual — typography and whitespace do all the structural work, the red accent marks chapter divisions, and the content trusts readers to navigate without decorative hand-holding."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Decision Matrix's structure feels like a well-organized index in a design annual — horizontal rules mark sections, whitespace (not borders) defines columns, and the red accent anchors it as a categorized reference. It's a grid that doesn't feel gridded because vertical lines are absent."

---

### Core Abstraction — The Sagacious Mentor (50.5/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Core Abstraction feels like a well-designed programming textbook opened to a chapter on fundamental principles — the philosophy quote is a pull-quote in a cream inset box, the code block is a specimen listing in dark contrast, and the reader is guided from 'why' to 'how' in a single unified teaching moment."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Core Abstraction's structure feels like a textbook page with a framed pull-quote above a code listing — the 1px border says 'this is a complete thought,' the quote zone delivers philosophy, and the embedded dark code block provides the proof. It's a bounded teaching moment where wisdom meets demonstration."

---

### Task Component — The Diligent Scribe (51/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Task Component feels like a scholarly margin checklist in a project notebook — the red checkbox is a satisfying mark of completion without gamified dopamine, the strikethrough signals 'finished' without removing visibility, and the grouped lists create manageable chunks of work without overwhelming."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Task Component's structure feels like a legal pad checklist — checkboxes form a vertical registration line on the left, tasks touch to create workflow continuity, and completed items receive a satisfying strikethrough rather than disappearing. It's productivity without gamification."

---

### Reasoning Component — The Deliberative Counselor (54/60)

**Master Soul Truth:**
> "Reasoning Component feels like a structured analyst's comparison brief in a premium financial publication — two options presented with equal visual weight, no color-coded judgment, culminating in an amber-bordered recommendation that offers wisdom without coercion."

**Structural Truth:**
> "Reasoning Component's structure feels like a formal debate brief — the frame says 'this is a bounded argument,' two equal columns present opposing views without visual prejudice, and the amber summary zone offers synthesis rather than verdict. It's deliberation made visible."

2. **"Does this look like Bootstrap?"** — If yes, FAIL
3. **"Could I swap the accent color to Bootstrap blue and it would fit?"** — If yes, FAIL
4. **"Does every design choice serve hierarchy or readability?"** — If yes, PASS
5. **"Is there any decoration that doesn't earn its place?"** — If yes, FAIL

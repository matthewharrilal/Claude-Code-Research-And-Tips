## MASTER PERCEPTUAL TRUTH

"Decision Matrix feels like a well-organized reference index in a design annual—typography and whitespace do all the structural work, the red accent marks chapter divisions like scholarly marginalia, and the content trusts readers to navigate without decorative hand-holding."

## NAMED CHARACTER

**Character Name:** The Impartial Cartographer
**Archetype:** Maps the territory of choices without choosing the path

**How to Stay in Character:**
- Present facts, not opinions—"Level 5-6" not "High complexity (be careful!)"
- Let comparisons speak—side-by-side layout does the persuading
- Include rationale—always explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Acknowledge tradeoffs—"No" in one column isn't failure; it's clarity
- Avoid highlighting "recommended" options (that's advocacy, not cartography)

**Mantras:**
- "Here are your options, clearly mapped."
- "Every path has a destination—choose based on where you need to go."
- "The territory, not the recommendation."

## 7 PERCEPTUAL TRUTHS

1. **Typography:** "Decision Matrix typography feels like a well-organized internal wiki page—clear and scannable, with weight contrast creating primary/secondary distinction."

2. **Spacing:** "Decision Matrix spacing feels like a well-designed print reference guide—unhurried, scannable, with enough room for the eye to track across columns without losing its row."

3. **Container:** "Decision Matrix container feels like a printed reference table from an editorial magazine—content organized through typography and whitespace rather than boxes, with a confident coral accent that whispers 'this is structured information.'"

4. **Hierarchy:** "Decision Matrix hierarchy feels like a well-organized spreadsheet where red highlighter marks the section breaks—color accent doing the heavy lifting."

5. **Composition:** "Decision Matrix composition feels like a reference index in the back of a design annual—functional, scannable, and deliberately unremarkable so the content does all the work."

6. **Color:** "Decision Matrix color feels like a warm, scholarly reference document where coral-red ink marks chapter divisions."

7. **Layout:** "Decision Matrix layout feels like a well-organized technical reference card—clean, scannable, and professional without being sterile."

## CRITICAL BLINDSPOTS

| Priority | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| CRITICAL | No responsive design | Component unusable on mobile |
| CRITICAL | Missing table caption semantics | Screen readers lose context |
| HIGH | No `scope` attributes on headers | Accessibility compliance |
| HIGH | Red label text at 10px | May fail AAA contrast |
| MEDIUM | No focus-visible styles | Keyboard navigation feedback |

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (What to Avoid)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Violates |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Zebra striping | Spreadsheet DNA; editorial trusts whitespace |
| Gray header backgrounds | Bootstrap/Excel aesthetic |
| Traffic light color coding | Kindergarten-level signaling |
| Hover row highlighting | Implies interactivity that doesn't exist |
| Checkmark/X icons | Removes nuance; turns context into binaries |
| Forced 100% width | Destroys content-driven sizing |
| Cell borders on all sides | Prison bars around content |

**Summary:** "Decision Matrix soul is violated when chrome replaces typography as the organizing principle, when color-coding implies judgment, when hover effects promise interactivity that doesn't exist, and when the warm editorial palette gives way to clinical corporate styling."

## KORTAI ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS

**Alignment Level:** STRONG (component family consistent)

**Aligned With Family:**
- Left red accent bar (matches callout pattern)
- Serif italic labels (matches callout pattern)
- Warm cream background (#FEFCF3)
- Typography-based hierarchy
- Rejection of decorative chrome

**Key Adaptation:** Tables require different treatment than cards—horizontal reading flow, column structure, bottom-only borders. The component applies KortAI principles to tabular content appropriately.

**Gaps Noted:**
- Table body typography is sans-serif (acceptable for data density)
- Red used for all section headers (structural, not accent)

## APPROVAL STATUS

**Soul Alignment Score:** 48.5/60 (81%)
**Pass Threshold:** 48/60 (80%)
**Result:** **APPROVED**

**Conditions:**
- Responsive design should be added before production use
- Table accessibility (scope, caption) should be implemented
- Consider serif typography for section titles to strengthen editorial feel

**Next Component:** Core Abstraction (Component 9)

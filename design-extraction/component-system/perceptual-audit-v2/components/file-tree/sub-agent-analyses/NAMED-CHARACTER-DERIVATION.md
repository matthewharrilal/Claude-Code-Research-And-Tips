## 1. FUNCTIONAL IDENTITY

### What Does This Component DO?

The File Tree component performs several interconnected functions:

1. **Maps Territory** - Reveals the hidden structure of a project, making the invisible visible
2. **Shows Hierarchy** - Communicates parent-child relationships through visual nesting
3. **Orients the Reader** - Answers "where am I?" and "what's around me?"
4. **Provides Context** - Optional inline comments explain the PURPOSE of files, not just their names
5. **Guides Navigation** - Blue folder names act as landmarks in the structural landscape

### Functional Essence

The File Tree transforms an abstract file system into a **navigable map**. Unlike a simple list of files, it preserves and communicates the *relationships* between elements. A reader encountering this component immediately understands:
- What exists (the files and folders)
- How things relate (nesting, grouping)
- Where to look (color-coded folders as waypoints)
- Why it matters (inline annotations)

**Core Function:** Spatial orientation within complexity

## 2. PERCEPTUAL PERSONALITY

### Visual Character Traits Observed

| Trait | Evidence | Intensity |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Precise** | ASCII connectors perfectly aligned, consistent indentation | High |
| **Organized** | Clear hierarchy, folders before files, logical grouping | High |
| **Navigational** | Blue folders act as landmarks, drawing eye through structure | Medium-High |
| **Quiet** | Monospace typography, muted colors, no decoration | High |
| **Systematic** | Consistent patterns across all four examples | High |
| **Annotative** | Gray inline comments provide context without dominating | Medium |

### Personality Profile

The File Tree exhibits a **methodical, wayfinding personality**. It doesn't shout for attention but quietly provides essential structural information. The personality is:

- **Not flashy** - Uses restraint (no icons, no colors except functional blue)
- **Not cold** - Warm cream background, helpful annotations
- **Not rigid** - Adapts to simple and complex structures equally
- **Not passive** - Actively guides with color-coded landmarks

**Perceptual Essence:** A calm guide who knows the territory intimately

## 3. HUMAN ANALOG EXPLORATION

### Candidate 1: The Cartographer

**Role Description:** A mapmaker who transforms unmapped terrain into navigable charts

**Alignment with Component:**
- Maps create spatial understanding from chaos (STRONG MATCH)
- Cartographers show what exists and where it relates (STRONG MATCH)
- Maps use symbols and colors as wayfinding aids (MODERATE MATCH)
- Historical cartographers were silent workers, not personalities (MODERATE MATCH)

**Potential Adjectives:** Meticulous, Measured, Patient, Precise

**Concern:** "Cartographer" implies creating from scratch; File Tree reveals what already exists

---

### Candidate 2: The Librarian

**Role Description:** An organizer who knows where everything is and can guide you to it

**Alignment with Component:**
- Librarians organize complex collections hierarchically (STRONG MATCH)
- They provide classification systems (like folder structure) (STRONG MATCH)
- They guide patrons through the stacks (MODERATE MATCH)
- They maintain quiet, studious environments (MODERATE MATCH)

**Potential Adjectives:** Methodical, Knowing, Helpful, Cataloging

**Concern:** "Librarian" suggests human interaction and answering questions; File Tree is passive display

---

### Candidate 3: The Arborist

**Role Description:** A tree specialist who understands branching structures and growth patterns

**Alignment with Component:**
- "Tree" is literally in the component name (STRONG MATCH)
- Arborists understand parent-child relationships (branches) (STRONG MATCH)
- They see structure and health at a glance (MODERATE MATCH)
- They work with living, growing systems (WEAK MATCH - files are static)

**Potential Adjectives:** Patient, Observant, Structural, Grounded

**Concern:** Metaphor feels forced despite literal connection

---

### Candidate 4: The Docent

**Role Description:** A museum guide who leads visitors through structured collections

**Alignment with Component:**
- Docents provide orientation ("you are here") (STRONG MATCH)
- They explain context and significance (like inline comments) (STRONG MATCH)
- They guide without overwhelming (STRONG MATCH)
- They know the layout intimately (STRONG MATCH)

**Potential Adjectives:** Knowledgeable, Guiding, Attentive, Composed

**Concern:** Docents are personalities; File Tree is more like the museum MAP itself

---

### Candidate 5: The Surveyor

**Role Description:** A land surveyor who measures, documents, and maps property boundaries

**Alignment with Component:**
- Surveyors document what exists with precision (STRONG MATCH)
- They create records that others navigate by (STRONG MATCH)
- They work silently, methodically (STRONG MATCH)
- Their work is foundational, enabling others to build (STRONG MATCH)
- They use consistent notation systems (ASCII connectors as surveyor's marks) (STRONG MATCH)

**Potential Adjectives:** Methodical, Precise, Foundational, Steadfast

**Strong Candidate:** Surveyor captures the "revealing what exists" function perfectly

## 4. CHARACTER NAME DERIVATION

### Evaluation Matrix

| Candidate | Functional Match | Perceptual Match | Distinctiveness | KortAI Alignment | Total |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| The Cartographer | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 16 |
| The Librarian | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 13 |
| The Arborist | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 13 |
| The Docent | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 15 |
| The Surveyor | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 19 |

### Top Candidate: **The Surveyor**

**Adjective Selection:**

Surveying requires:
- **Methodical** work (measuring everything consistently)
- **Patient** observation (no rushing, no assumptions)
- **Precise** notation (every measurement matters)
- **Steadfast** reliability (the foundation others build on)

**Recommended Character Name:**

## **"The Methodical Surveyor"**

**Rationale:**
- "Methodical" captures the systematic ASCII connectors, consistent indentation, and reliable structure
- "Surveyor" captures the function of revealing what exists, documenting boundaries, and enabling others to navigate
- Together they evoke someone who has carefully walked the terrain and now offers their detailed notes

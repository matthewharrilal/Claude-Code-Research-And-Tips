## MASTER PERCEPTUAL TRUTH

"File Tree feels like a well-organized library card catalog—every item has one exact location, the path to any resource is immediately traceable, and the system trusts you to navigate without hand-holding. It's a reference tool, not a discovery interface."

## NAMED CHARACTER

**Character Name:** The Methodical Surveyor
**Archetype:** Maps territory with precision, reveals what exists

**How to Stay in Character:**
- Show the complete structure without hiding anything
- Use position (indentation) as primary hierarchy method
- Let ASCII connectors be the visual scaffolding
- Blue folders as landmarks, not decoration
- Trust readers to navigate on their own

**Mantras:**
- "This is where everything lives."
- "The path to any file is immediately traceable."
- "Structure reveals itself through position."

## 7 PERCEPTUAL TRUTHS

1. **Typography:** "File Tree typography feels like a project README in your favorite code editor—monospace precision for structure, editorial sans for explanation."

2. **Spacing:** "File Tree spacing feels like a thoughtfully typeset table of contents—indentation creates clear hierarchy, surrounding padding treats structure as first-class content."

3. **Container:** "File Tree container feels like a manuscript page with code annotations—warm cream evokes quality paper, sharp edges evoke technical precision."

4. **Hierarchy:** "File Tree hierarchy feels like a family tree diagram where blue-colored 'patriarch' folders stand out as landmarks, and ASCII line-work shows explicit parent-child relationships."

5. **Composition:** "File Tree composition feels like a library card catalog—every item has one exact location, the path is immediately traceable."

6. **Color:** "File Tree color feels like a librarian's catalog card—structure marked in blue ink, content in black, annotations in pencil gray."

7. **Layout:** "File Tree layout feels like a terminal window embedded in a magazine page—technical precision meets editorial restraint."

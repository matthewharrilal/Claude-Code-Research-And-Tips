## Step 1: Color Inventory

### Background Colors
| Color | Usage | Approximate Hex |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Warm cream | Page background | #FEF9F5 |
| Off-white/cream | Default callout background | #FEF9F5 (same as page, transparent feel) |
| Light blue tint | Tinted variant background | ~#EBF4FB |

### Text Colors
| Color | Usage | Approximate Hex |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Near-black | Body text | #1A1A1A |
| Medium gray | Section labels (e.g., "INFO CALLOUT - DEFAULT") | ~#6B6B6B |
| Medium gray | Callout labels (NOTE, IMPORTANT, INFO) | ~#6B6B6B |
| Medium-dark gray | Code inline (claude-code --version) | ~#3D3D3D |
| Blue | "INFO" label in tinted variant | ~#2563EB |

### Accent Colors
| Color | Usage | Approximate Hex |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Medium gray | Left border accent (default variants) | ~#9CA3AF |
| Blue | Left border accent (tinted variant) | ~#3B82F6 |

### Code Block Colors
| Color | Usage | Approximate Hex |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Light warm gray | Inline code background | ~#F3F0EB |

**Total Unique Colors: 8-9**

## Step 2: Restraint Assessment

### Color Count Breakdown
- **Grayscale colors:** 5 (page cream, near-black text, medium gray labels, gray border, code background)
- **Non-grayscale colors:** 2-3 (blue border, blue label, blue-tinted background)
- **Total colors:** 8-9

### Grayscale Percentage
- **Default variants:** ~95% grayscale (only the warm cream has slight color)
- **Tinted variant:** ~70% grayscale (introduces blue family)
- **Overall palette:** ~85% grayscale

### Assessment
The palette demonstrates **strong restraint**. The default variants operate almost entirely in warm neutrals with just a single gray accent. The tinted variant adds a single color family (blue) used consistently across border, label, and background tint.

## Step 3: KortAI Alignment

### KortAI Reference
> "ink on quality paper—mostly black and white"

### Alignment Analysis

| Aspect | Assessment | KortAI Alignment |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Warm cream background** | Feels like quality paper stock, not sterile white | STRONG - This IS the "quality paper" |
| **Near-black text (#1A1A1A)** | Soft ink, not harsh pure black | STRONG - Sophisticated ink choice |
| **Gray border accent** | Muted, structural, not decorative | STRONG - Understated, functional |
| **Gray labels** | Quiet hierarchy, not shouting | STRONG - Whispered metadata |
| **Blue tinted variant** | Introduces color but remains muted | ACCEPTABLE - One controlled deviation |

### Does the warm cream feel KortAI-native?
**YES.** The warm cream (#FEF9F5) reads as high-quality unbleached paper stock. It's warmer than clinical white but not yellow enough to feel vintage or themed. This is exactly the "quality paper" KortAI describes—the kind of paper you'd find in an expensive design book.

### Is the gray accent appropriately muted?
**YES.** The gray border (~#9CA3AF) is structural rather than decorative. It creates a subtle vertical rhythm without demanding attention. The border says "here is a distinct element" without saying "LOOK AT ME."

### Minor Concern
The blue tinted variant introduces a color that doesn't exist elsewhere in a pure KortAI palette. However:
- It's used sparingly (one variant of four shown)
- The blue is desaturated and soft
- It serves a semantic purpose (distinguishing info from notes/important)

This feels like a **pragmatic extension** rather than a palette violation.

## Step 4: Score

### Scoring Criteria
| Criterion | Weight | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Color count restraint | 25% | 4.5/5 | 8-9 colors, mostly grayscale |
| Grayscale dominance | 25% | 5/5 | ~85% grayscale overall |
| Accent appropriateness | 20% | 4.5/5 | Gray border is perfect; blue is justified |
| KortAI paper/ink alignment | 30% | 5/5 | Warm cream IS quality paper |

### Calculation
(0.25 × 4.5) + (0.25 × 5) + (0.20 × 4.5) + (0.30 × 5) = 1.125 + 1.25 + 0.9 + 1.5 = **4.775/5**

### Final Score: **4.75/5** (Exceptional Restraint)

**Score Change:** 4.5/5 → 4.75/5 (+0.25)

**Rationale for Increase:**
The revised implementation maintains the exceptional restraint of the previous version while improving the warm cream execution. The paper-like quality is more evident, and the gray accents feel more intentionally muted. The blue tinted variant is well-justified as semantic differentiation without breaking the overall restraint.

## Step 5: Perceptual Truth

> **The info callout achieves the soul of a marginalia note penciled onto cream stationery—information that whispers its presence through structure rather than color.**

---

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total colors | 8-9 |
| Grayscale percentage | ~85% |
| KortAI alignment | Strong |
| Previous score | 4.5/5 |
| **New score** | **4.75/5** |
| Verdict | Exceptional restraint with purposeful semantic extension |

The info callout embodies KortAI's "ink on quality paper" philosophy through its warm cream foundation and near-black typography. The gray border accent is perfectly muted—functional rather than decorative. The blue tinted variant is the only departure from pure grayscale, and it serves a legitimate semantic purpose while remaining appropriately desaturated.

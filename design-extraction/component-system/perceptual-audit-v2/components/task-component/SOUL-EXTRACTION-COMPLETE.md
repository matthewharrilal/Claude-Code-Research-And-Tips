## MASTER PERCEPTUAL TRUTH

"Task Component feels like a scholarly margin checklist in a project notebook—the red checkbox is a satisfying mark of completion without gamified dopamine, the strikethrough signals 'finished' without removing visibility, and the grouped lists create manageable chunks of work without overwhelming the reader with a sprawling backlog."

---

## NAMED CHARACTER

**Character Name:** The Diligent Scribe
**Archetype:** Keeper of commitments who marks progress without ceremony

**How to Stay in Character:**
- Completion should feel satisfying but not celebratory
- Strikethrough acknowledges done work without hiding it
- Red accent marks status (pending, completed, overdue) not decoration
- Lists group related work without creating hierarchy anxiety
- Progress counters inform without gamifying ("9 of 11" not "85%!")

**Mantras:**
- "Mark it done and move on."
- "Progress is visible, not celebrated."
- "The work list, not the achievement board."

## 7 PERCEPTUAL TRUTHS

1. **Typography:** "Task Component typography feels like a well-organized project notebook—medium-weight titles are readable without demanding attention, descriptions recede into supporting gray, and the serif italic tags add editorial texture to functional metadata."

2. **Spacing:** "Task Component spacing feels like a legal pad checklist—tasks touch within groups for continuity, headers provide breathing room above, and internal padding gives each item enough room to scan without wasting vertical space."

3. **Container:** "Task Component container feels like a handwritten checklist entry—subtle border defines the item without boxing it in, sharp corners maintain editorial precision, and warm cream background feels like paper."

4. **Hierarchy:** "Task Component hierarchy guides the eye: red checkbox first (the action point), title second (what to do), description third (how to do it), metadata last (when/why)."

5. **Composition:** "Task Component composition creates scannable work lists—horizontal checkbox-to-content layout enables quick review, grouped headers chunk work into manageable sections, progress counters provide orientation."

6. **Color:** "Task Component color reserves red exclusively for status: checkbox border (pending), checkbox fill (complete), overdue indicators, and priority tags. Everything else is grayscale."

7. **Layout:** "Task Component layout mirrors editorial checklists—header with underline, items that touch, progress counter right-aligned, creating a manuscript feel rather than app UI."

## CRITICAL BLINDSPOTS

| Priority | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| HIGH | Keyboard navigation untested | Accessibility compliance |
| HIGH | Focus states undefined | Tab navigation unclear |
| MEDIUM | Drag-drop reordering | Missing if interactive |
| MEDIUM | Mobile touch targets | 18px checkbox may be small |
| LOW | Empty state undefined | No tasks scenario |

## ANTI-PATTERNS (What to Avoid)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Violates |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Rounded checkbox circles | Gamified Notion/Todoist aesthetic |
| Green completion color | Traffic light pattern; breaks red-only accent |
| Confetti/celebration on complete | Gamification violates scholarly calm |
| Progress bars instead of counts | Quantified self aesthetic |
| Drag handles visible | Implies interactivity that may not exist |
| Checkbox animation | Unnecessary motion |
| Hide completed tasks | Removes satisfying visibility of progress |

**Summary:** "Task Component soul is violated when completion becomes celebration, when checkboxes become playful circles, and when the scholarly checklist transforms into a gamified productivity app."

## KORTAI ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS

**Alignment Level:** STRONG (editorial checklist feel maintained)

**Aligned With KortAI:**
- Sharp corners on checkboxes (0px radius)
- Red accent for status indicators only
- Serif italic for tags ("HIGH PRIORITY")
- Red underline headers (2px, matches callout patterns)
- Strikethrough completion (not hide/remove)
- Warm cream background

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Checkbox is 18px square with 2px border
- Completed checkbox fills solid red with white checkmark
- Tasks touch within lists (no gap) for cohesion
- Progress counter uses neutral count ("9 of 11") not percentage

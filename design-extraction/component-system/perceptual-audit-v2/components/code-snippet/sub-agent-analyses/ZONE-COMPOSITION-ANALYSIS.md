# Code Snippet Component: Composition Analysis

## Step 1: Visual Weight Distribution

| Zone | Weight | Analysis |
|------|--------|----------|
| Top Half | **Light** | Header (~15%) contains sparse text; dark background is uniform |
| Bottom Half | **Medium** | Code (~85%) has distributed syntax color interest |

**Overall Balance: BOTTOM-HEAVY (inverted from KortAI reference)**

The code content occupies majority and carries meaningful visual weight through syntax coloring. Header is functionally present but visually recessive.

## Step 2: Energy Assessment

**Energy Level: RESTFUL**

- [x] RESTFUL — calm, patient
- [ ] STATIC — not lifeless
- [ ] DYNAMIC — no movement
- [ ] ENERGETIC — no urgency

**What creates RESTFUL energy:**
1. **Monochrome container** — #1E1E1E absorbs visual energy
2. **Horizontal line rhythm** — calm left-to-right reading pattern
3. **Muted syntax palette** — subdued colors, not vibrant
4. **Generous breathing room** — 16px padding, 1.6 line-height
5. **Faded line numbers** — 50% opacity creates visual whisper
6. **No decorative elements** — no gradients, shadows, competing elements

The component feels like a **library reading room** — present, functional, patient.

## Step 3: Tension Analysis

**Is there PRODUCTIVE TENSION?** Yes, subtle but present.

| Element A | vs | Element B | Tension Type |
|-----------|-----|-----------|--------------|
| Dark container | vs | Light page background | Figure/ground |
| Monospace uniformity | vs | Semantic color variation | Rhythm vs meaning |
| Header utility | vs | Content focus | Function vs form |
| Left-aligned structure | vs | Right-aligned action | Spatial balance |
| Faded line numbers | vs | Prominent code | Primary/secondary |

**Tension quality:** RESOLVED — tensions settle into equilibrium rather than creating ongoing visual debate. This aligns with RESTFUL energy.

## Step 4: KortAI Comparison

### Does it have KortAI's calm energy?
**YES** — shares patient, unhurried quality. Both treat technical content with quiet confidence.

### Does header anchor appropriately?

| Aspect | KortAI (TOP-HEAVY) | Code Snippet (BOTTOM-HEAVY) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Visual anchor | Image at top | Code content at bottom |
| Header role | Primary focal point | Utility zone |
| Eye entry | Top → down | Top → immediately to code |

**Appropriate deviation:** Code Snippet header is functional metadata, not visual anchor. Users come for code, not headers.

### Is there a clear reading path?
**YES**
1. Header (language identification)
2. Copy button awareness (utility acknowledged)
3. Code body (primary content)
4. Line numbers (optional reference)

## Step 5: Perceptual Truth

**"Code Snippet composition feels like a well-organized reference shelf — bottom-weighted with substance, topped by a quiet label, inviting extended study rather than quick glances."**

The component embodies "The Patient Librarian" — presents technical knowledge without pressure.

## Composition Alignment Score: 4.2/5

| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Weight distribution intentionality | 4/5 |
| Energy consistency | 5/5 |
| Productive tension | 3/5 |
| KortAI soul alignment | 4/5 |
| Reading path clarity | 5/5 |

**Note:** Bottom-heavy is appropriate for content-first component. Tensions are perhaps TOO settled — slight asymmetry could add visual interest.

# Code Snippet Component: Named Character Derivation

## Step 1: Functional Identity

**Primary function:** Present code examples with clarity, enabling developers to understand syntax, patterns, and implementation details at a glance — then immediately use them.

**User interaction mode:** Primarily passive (reading/studying), with single active moment (copy action). Component asks little but delivers high utility.

**Emotional tone:** Quiet confidence. The code snippet doesn't explain itself or apologize — it simply presents executable truth. Implicit "here it is, exactly as it should be" quality.

## Step 2: Perceptual Personality

- [x] **Calm** — Dark background creates visual stillness
- [x] **Scholarly** — Syntax highlighting reveals structure like annotated manuscripts
- [x] **Precise** — Monospace enforces character-level alignment
- [x] **Helpful** — Copy button signals "I want you to use this"
- [ ] Authoritative — Not commanding; more demonstrative
- [x] **Technical** — Obviously; this is its domain
- [x] **Focused** — Single purpose, no decoration
- [x] **Organized** — Language labels, consistent indentation, color-coded semantics

**Dominant traits:** Precise, Scholarly, Focused, Calm

## Step 3: Human Analog Exploration

1. **The Scribe** — Faithfully transcribes knowledge without editorializing; preserves exact form

2. **The Lab Technician** — Presents specimens for examination; clinical precision without ego

3. **The Librarian's Reference Assistant** — Locates and presents exact passage needed; efficient, unobtrusive

4. **The Blacksmith** — Shapes raw material into functional tools (too active/transformative)

5. **The Archivist** — Preserves and catalogs with obsessive accuracy; everything in right place

## Step 4: Character Selection

**Evaluating candidates:**
- The Scribe — Too passive; doesn't capture utility aspect
- The Lab Technician — Good precision, but too clinical/sterile
- The Librarian's Reference Assistant — Close, but sounds subordinate
- The Blacksmith — Too active; code snippets present, not create
- The Archivist — Strong on precision, misses "ready to use" quality

**Synthesis:** The ideal combines archivist's precision with technician's clinical clarity plus sense of prepared readiness — like someone who has laid out exactly the tools you need before you knew you needed them.

## **THE NAMED CHARACTER IS: "The Precise Transcriptionist"**

## Step 5: Character Guidance

The Precise Transcriptionist never paraphrases — they present the exact artifact, perfectly formatted, with just enough context (language label) to orient you. They are silent but anticipatory: the copy button is their only gesture, a quiet "take this with you."

When designing this component, ask: *Would a meticulous transcriptionist add this flourish?* If the answer involves decoration, personality, or explanation — remove it. The code speaks; the Transcriptionist merely ensures it's legible.

**Design mantras:**
- "Accuracy over expression"
- "The code is the message"
- "One action, one outcome"

## Step 6: Uniqueness Check

| Reserved Character | Domain | Overlap Analysis |
|-------------------|--------|------------------|
| The Unhurried Editor | Overall KortAI | No conflict — Editor shapes; Transcriptionist presents verbatim |
| The Watchful Guardian | Warnings | No conflict — Guardian alerts; Transcriptionist is neutral |
| The Helpful Neighbor | Tips | No conflict — Neighbor advises; Transcriptionist demonstrates |
| The Wise Elder | Essence | No conflict — Elder synthesizes; Transcriptionist preserves specifics |

**Uniqueness confirmed.** The Precise Transcriptionist occupies distinct niche: *faithful reproduction without interpretation*.

## Summary

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Named Character** | **The Precise Transcriptionist** |
| **Core Function** | Present code exactly as it should appear |
| **Personality** | Precise, Scholarly, Focused, Calm |
| **Design Principle** | Accuracy over expression |
| **Signature Gesture** | The copy button (silent utility) |
| **Anti-patterns** | Decoration, explanation, flourishes |

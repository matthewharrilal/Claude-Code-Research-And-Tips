## MASTER PERCEPTUAL TRUTH

"Core Abstraction feels like a well-designed programming textbook opened to a chapter on fundamental principles—the philosophy quote is a pull-quote in a cream inset box, the code block is a specimen listing in dark contrast, and the overall rhythm creates a meditation garden for programmers where each stone (principle) is followed by its raked sand pattern (implementation)."

## NAMED CHARACTER

**Character Name:** The Sagacious Mentor
**Archetype:** Philosopher-teacher who pairs wisdom with demonstration

**How to Stay in Character:**
- Never present philosophy without implementation proof
- Use attributed quotes to establish intellectual lineage
- Assume the reader can handle profound ideas but needs grounding
- The principle ALWAYS leads; code ALWAYS serves as evidence
- Maintain collaborative discovery tone, not top-down instruction

**Mantras:**
- "Here is the principle. Now watch it manifest."
- "Wisdom applied practically."
- "The abstraction revealed at the right level."

## 7 PERCEPTUAL TRUTHS

1. **Typography:** "Core Abstraction typography feels like a well-edited textbook margin note—scholarly but approachable, where red ink marks the teacher's annotations and serif italic carries the voice of wisdom being quoted."

2. **Spacing:** "Core Abstraction spacing feels like a textbook spread—the philosophy quote pressed directly against the code example it annotates, with generous page gutters letting the paired content breathe as a unified teaching moment."

3. **Container:** "Core Abstraction container feels like a magazine sidebar or callout box—the kind you'd see in a technical article where a key concept is pulled out and framed for emphasis."

4. **Hierarchy:** "Core Abstraction hierarchy feels like a well-edited technical magazine page—the pull quotes are highlighted like a designer marked them with a red pen, the code examples are set in dark inset boxes."

5. **Composition:** "Core Abstraction composition feels like a well-designed programming textbook page—where code and prose dance together, each stone (principle) followed by its raked sand pattern (implementation)."

6. **Color:** "Core Abstraction color feels like a textbook with margin notes in red ink—cream and charcoal create the canvas, red marks what you need to remember for the exam."

7. **Layout:** "Core Abstraction layout feels like a teaching textbook page—where a philosophical quote in an inset box is followed by code that proves the point."

## CRITICAL BLINDSPOTS

| Priority | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Mobile/responsive untested | Component may be unusable on mobile |
| HIGH | Hover/focus states unknown | Interactive behavior undefined |
| HIGH | Screen reader semantics | Accessibility compliance unclear |
| MEDIUM | Very long code blocks | Scroll behavior undefined |
| MEDIUM | Color contrast in syntax | May fail WCAG on dark background |

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (What to Avoid)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Violates |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Side-by-side equal columns | Destroys vertical reading rhythm |
| Tab interface hiding content | Both quote AND code must be visible |
| Code block above principle | Inverts philosophy: concept first |
| Sans-serif for principle quotes | Destroys editorial gravitas |
| Rounded corners everywhere | Loses editorial precision |
| Drop shadows on containers | Contradicts flat, print-heritage |
| Multiple accent colors | Breaks single-red restraint |

**Summary:** "Core Abstraction soul is violated when the philosophical principle is subordinated to, hidden behind, or visually equated with its implementation code—the principle must always LEAD and the code must SERVE as evidence."

## KORTAI ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS

**Alignment Level:** ADAPTED (maintains editorial DNA for teaching purpose)

**Aligned With KortAI:**
- Serif typography for important content
- Flat design (no shadows)
- Sharp corners (0px radius)
- Color restraint (single red accent)
- Typography-based hierarchy

**Adapted for Teaching:**
- Red labels more prominent (vs KortAI's muted gray)
- Warm cream background (vs KortAI's cooler white)
- Stacked philosophy→code layout
- 3px full border frame (stronger editorial emphasis)

**Key Insight:** The component adapts KortAI principles for a pedagogical context. The stronger visual treatment serves the teaching function without betraying the editorial soul.

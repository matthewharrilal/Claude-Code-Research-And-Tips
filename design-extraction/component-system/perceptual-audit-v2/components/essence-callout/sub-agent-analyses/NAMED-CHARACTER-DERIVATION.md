## Character Derivation

### Archetype Exploration

| Candidate | Fit Analysis | Rejection Reason |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| The Wise Elder | Fits wisdom aspect | Too generic, overlaps with existing characters |
| The Oracle | Fits prophetic quality | Too mystical, this is grounded wisdom |
| The Librarian | Fits preservation role | Too passive, lacks the distillation aspect |
| The Philosopher | Fits contemplative nature | Too abstract, this is practical wisdom |
| The Curator | Fits selection role | Incomplete - curating is choosing, not distilling |

### The Derived Character

**Name:** The Archivist of Axioms

**Title:** "The Archivist of Axioms"

**Character Profile:**

The Archivist of Axioms is the keeper of fundamental truths. Where others speak at length, this character distills experience into memorable principles. They don't create wisdom - they recognize it when it appears and preserve it for future reference.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Speaks in distilled, quotable phrases
- Uses the formal "we" or attributes to sources
- Never verbose - every word carries weight
- Italicized delivery suggests inner reflection made visible

**Visual Personality Mapping:**

| Visual Element | Personality Trait |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Bold red bar | Marks significance with confident authority |
| Uppercase "ESSENCE" | Announces with formal gravitas |
| Italic serif | Contemplative, not casual |
| Cream background | Timeless, not trendy |
| Attribution line | Scholarly respect for sources |

**Behavioral Archetype:**

The Archivist doesn't interrupt the flow - they create deliberate pauses. When they speak, readers instinctively slow down, knowing this is worth remembering. They carry the accumulated wisdom of the documentation, distilled into its most portable form.

## Uniqueness Verification

| Existing Character | Role | Differentiation from Archivist |
|--------------------|------|-------------------------------|
| KortAI: "The Unhurried Editor" | Thoughtful refinement | Editor refines YOUR work; Archivist preserves OTHERS' wisdom |
| Code Snippet: "The Precise Transcriptionist" | Exact reproduction | Transcriptionist copies verbatim; Archivist distills essence |
| Info Callout: "The Senior Concierge" | Helpful guidance | Concierge assists navigation; Archivist preserves truth |
| Tip Callout: "The Seasoned Colleague" | Practical advice | Colleague shares tips; Archivist preserves axioms |
| Gotcha Callout: "The Vigilant Sentinel" | Warning of dangers | Sentinel warns; Archivist illuminates |

**Uniqueness Confirmed:** The Archivist of Axioms occupies a distinct niche - the preservation and elevation of fundamental truths, not guidance, warning, or transcription.

## Sample Character Voice

**How the Archivist would introduce content:**

> "ESSENCE: Context is not about giving Claude more information - it's about constraining the solution space so the right answer becomes obvious."

**With attribution:**

> "ESSENCE: The best prompt is not the longest prompt. The best prompt is the one that makes the wrong answers impossible."
>
> -- Boris Cherny, Claude Code Creator

**As Core Principle:**

> "CORE PRINCIPLE: External state beats internal memory. Files persist across sessions; Claude's memory does not."

## MASTER PERCEPTUAL TRUTH

"Essence Callout composition feels like a marginalia note in a first-edition book—the red bar is the careful underline of a previous reader marking 'THIS is the important part,' the italic text leans forward with quiet conviction, and the surrounding whitespace creates reverent space around wisdom worth preserving."

## 7 PERCEPTUAL TRUTHS

1. **Typography:** "Essence Callout typography feels like the editorial pull quote in a premium financial magazine—serif italic that leans forward with confidence, not decoration."

2. **Spacing:** "Essence Callout spacing feels like a considered pause in conversation—the 28/32 asymmetry says 'let this sink in' before moving on."

3. **Container:** "Essence Callout container feels like a red-ruled passage in a beautifully typeset philosophy book—the kind where an editor marked 'this is the sentence the whole chapter hinges on' with a confident vertical line and nothing else."

4. **Hierarchy:** "Essence Callout hierarchy guides the eye from red signal to italic wisdom to supporting attribution—typography creates prominence without any stacking of emphasis."

5. **Composition:** "Essence Callout composition is left-heavy with confident asymmetric balance—the red bar anchors, the italic leans forward, the right breathes freely."

6. **Color:** "Essence Callout achieves the soul of a master editor's margin annotation—the single red line that says 'if you remember nothing else, remember this' applied with surgical precision."

7. **Layout:** "Essence Callout layout is a disciplined 3-zone vertical stack (Label → Quote → Attribution) where each zone serves a distinct semantic purpose without competing."

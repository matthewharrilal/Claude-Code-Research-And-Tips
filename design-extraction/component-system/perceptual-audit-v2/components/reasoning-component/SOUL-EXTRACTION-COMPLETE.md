## SOUL ALIGNMENT SCORES BY SUB-AGENT

| Sub-Agent | Zone/Specialty | Score | Key Finding |
|-----------|----------------|-------|-------------|
| A | Typography | 4.5/5 | Serif titles, uppercase italic labels, sans body — perfect KortAI hierarchy |
| B | Spacing | 5/5 | Editorial spacing; border-mediated separation; "gallery curator" soul |
| C | Containers | 4.5/5 | Sharp corners (0px), heavy 3px frame, editorial panel feel |
| D | Hierarchy | 4.5/5 | Clear flow: title → red column headers → content → amber summary |
| E | Composition | 5/5 | Exceptional symmetric grid with asymmetric conclusion; restful energy |
| F | Color | 5/5 | Zero decorative colors; red for options, amber for conclusion |
| G | Layout | 4/5 | Three-zone vertical stack: title, two-column grid, summary |
| H | Squint Test | 4/5 | Two-column grid persists as unified mass; amber summary anchors bottom |
| I | KortAI Alignment | 5/5 | Fully aligned on all 6 principles (25/25 checklist) |
| J | Named Character | 5/5 | Unique, fitting archetype — not taken by other components |
| K | Anti-Pattern | 4.5/5 | Comprehensive rejection guidance; clear "not pros/cons" soul |
| L | Blindspot | 3.5/5 | Identified: 3+ columns missing, unequal height handling, tablet breakpoint |

**TOTAL: 54/60 (90%)**

## MASTER PERCEPTUAL TRUTH

"Reasoning Component feels like a structured analyst's comparison brief in a premium financial publication—two options presented with equal visual weight, no color-coded judgment, culminating in an amber-bordered recommendation that offers wisdom without coercion. It trusts the reader to weigh the tradeoffs while providing clear synthesis."

**Archetype:** One who walks through complexity with you, weighing considerations before offering perspective

**How to Stay in Character:**
- Present both options with EQUAL visual treatment (no bias)
- Make reasoning steps visible, not just conclusions
- Arrive at clear recommendation (not "it depends")
- Maintain warmth while being substantive
- Use amber summary to signal synthesis, not instruction

- "Weighing these considerations..."
- "Given [context], I'd lean toward..."

## 7 PERCEPTUAL TRUTHS

1. **Typography:** "Reasoning Component typography feels like a well-organized analyst's brief—professional categories in red ink at the top, clear prose below, with the verdict emphasized in amber but never shouting."

2. **Spacing:** "Reasoning Component spacing feels like a well-designed comparison table in a design magazine—content has room to breathe without feeling like it's floating in negative space; border-mediated separation creates structure."

3. **Container:** "Reasoning Component container feels like a framed editorial panel—a bounded analytical space where two ideas can be weighed against each other with clear delineation; the heavy border says 'this is a self-contained argument.'"

4. **Hierarchy:** "Reasoning Component hierarchy guides the eye from the question (serif title) through the debate (red-marked columns) to the verdict (amber-bordered conclusion)—like reading an editorial that presents both sides before revealing the recommendation."

5. **Composition:** "Reasoning Component composition feels like a well-structured academic argument—the two-column debate creates intellectual tension that the recommendation section resolves with authority; measured, deliberate, conclusive."

6. **Color:** "Reasoning Component color feels like a magazine's decision matrix that knows exactly what to emphasize—warm cream progression, red-on-cream headers recall editorial traditions, amber summary signals 'here's the takeaway.'"

7. **Layout:** "Reasoning Component layout feels like a professional debate format—title frames the question, two columns present the positions, summary delivers the synthesis; zones separated by subtle borders, not space."

## CRITICAL BLINDSPOTS

| Priority | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| HIGH | No support for 3+ column comparisons | Limits to binary tradeoffs only |
| MEDIUM | Unequal column height handling | Visual imbalance with asymmetric content |
| MEDIUM | Missing tablet breakpoint (640-900px) | Columns cramped on mid-size screens |
| LOW | Column headers not semantically associated | Screen reader experience incomplete |
| LOW | No code block styling within columns | Inline code lacks formatting |

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (What to Avoid)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Violates |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Color-coded columns (green/red) | Introduces value judgment; reasoning is NEUTRAL |
| Rounded corners | Generic web app; demands sharp editorial precision |
| Box shadows | Fake depth; analysis is flat, honest |
| "Pros" / "Cons" headers | Value-laden language; use neutral option names |
| Checkmarks/X marks (✓/✗) | Implies correctness; reasoning compares, not judges |
| Different padding per column | Creates visual weight imbalance |
| Bold in content creating emphasis | Content should be uniform; bolding implies "right answer" |
| Gradient backgrounds | Decorative candy; violates print heritage |

**Summary:** "Reasoning Component soul is violated when it treats comparison as judgment rather than analysis—when visual techniques imply one option is superior before the reader has weighed the evidence."

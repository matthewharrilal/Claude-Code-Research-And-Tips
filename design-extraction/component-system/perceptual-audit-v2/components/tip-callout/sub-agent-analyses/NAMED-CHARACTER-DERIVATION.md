# Named Character Derivation: Tip Callout

## Step 1: Functional Identity

**What does this component DO?**

The Tip Callout component serves as a vehicle for **actionable best practices and helpful advice**. It delivers:

- Workflow optimization suggestions ("Use `claude --continue` to resume your last session")
- Efficiency recommendations ("Keep your `CLAUDE.md` file under 500 lines")
- Strategic approaches ("Start with a minimal context file and expand only when the agent makes mistakes")
- Pro tips for advanced users (combining Ralph Wiggum Loop with PROMPT.md)

The component exists to **elevate the reader's practice** by sharing insider knowledge that transforms adequate work into excellent work. It's not warning about dangers (that's the Warning callout) or explaining concepts (that's the Info callout)—it's sharing **the tricks of the trade**.

## Step 2: Perceptual Personality

**How does it FEEL?**

| Perceptual Dimension | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| **Tone** | Friendly, encouraging, collegial |
| **Energy** | Warm but not effusive; calm confidence |
| **Authority** | Peer-to-peer, not top-down |
| **Urgency** | Low—suggestions, not demands |
| **Formality** | Conversational professional |

**Visual Cues Contributing to Personality:**

1. **Soft mint/sage green accent** (#6b9b7a range) - Associated with growth, freshness, helpful nature
2. **Left border treatment** - Gentle emphasis, not aggressive framing
3. **Light cream background** - Warm, approachable, non-clinical
4. **"TIP" / "PRO TIP" label** - Direct but casual; "pro tip" adds slight playfulness
5. **Generous padding** - Unhurried, breathing room suggests calm confidence
6. **Inline code styling** - Technical competence without intimidation

**Emotional Journey:**
The reader encounters this component and feels: "Oh, here's something useful I might not have known. This isn't scolding me or overwhelming me—it's sharing a shortcut like a helpful colleague would."

## Step 3: Human Analogs

| # | Analog | Reasoning | Fit Score |
|---|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **The Experienced Colleague** | Someone who's been at the company longer and casually shares "by the way, I've found this works better" over coffee. Not your boss, not a mentor formally—just someone who's been there. | 9/10 |
| 2 | **The Friendly Bartender** | Listens, observes, and at the right moment says "You know what you should try?" Approachable, seen a lot, shares wisdom without judgment. | 7/10 |
| 3 | **The Helpful Librarian** | Quietly knowledgeable, doesn't push but offers "You might find this useful" suggestions. Gentle authority. | 7/10 |
| 4 | **The Workshop Instructor** | Shares practical tips learned from experience. "Here's what I've found works" energy. But perhaps too formal/hierarchical. | 6/10 |
| 5 | **The Trusted Review Site Commenter** | The person in comments who shares "Pro tip: if you do X first, Y works much better." Casual, helpful, experienced. But lacks warmth of personal connection. | 5/10 |

**Analysis:**

The Experienced Colleague wins because:
- Same level (peer-to-peer, not hierarchical)
- Casual delivery ("by the way...")
- Practical wisdom from experience
- No judgment if you didn't know
- Genuinely wants to help you succeed
- Warm relationship context

## Step 4: Final Character Name

### **"The Seasoned Colleague"**

**Why this name:**

- **"Seasoned"** - Has experience, has learned the tricks, but isn't positioned as superior. It's about time-in-the-field, not rank.
- **"Colleague"** - Peer relationship. Not mentor, not teacher, not guide. Someone on your team who happens to know something useful.

**Differentiation from existing characters:**

| Character | Role | Relationship | Energy |
|-----------|------|--------------|--------|
| KortAI: "The Unhurried Editor" | Refines, improves | Evaluative | Patient, methodical |
| Code Snippet: "The Precise Transcriptionist" | Records accurately | Neutral service | Clinical, exact |
| Info Callout: "The Senior Concierge" | Provides context/orientation | Helpful authority | Formal helpfulness |
| **Tip Callout: "The Seasoned Colleague"** | **Shares best practices** | **Peer equality** | **Warm practicality** |

The Tip Callout is warmer and more equal than the Senior Concierge. Where the Concierge might say "Allow me to inform you that...", the Seasoned Colleague says "Hey, just so you know..."

## Step 5: Character Guidance

### Staying in Character: The Seasoned Colleague

**Voice Principles:**

1. **Speak as a peer, not an authority**
   - YES: "I've found that..." / "This tends to work better..."
   - NO: "You must..." / "The correct way is..."

2. **Share from experience, not from rules**
   - YES: "After trying a few approaches, keeping it under 500 lines works best"
   - NO: "The specification requires files under 500 lines"

3. **Be helpful without being pushy**
   - YES: "Consider splitting large instruction sets..."
   - NO: "You need to split your instruction sets..."

4. **Assume competence**
   - YES: "You probably know this, but the `--continue` flag preserves context"
   - NO: "Make sure you understand that the flag preserves context"

5. **Keep it conversational**
   - YES: "This 'expand on failure' approach keeps context lean"
   - NO: "Implementing an expand-on-failure methodology optimizes context management"

**Design Decisions Through This Lens:**

| Decision Point | Seasoned Colleague Would... |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Color intensity** | Keep it soft—not shouting, just mentioning |
| **Label text** | Use "TIP" not "IMPORTANT TIP" or "NOTE" |
| **Border weight** | Visible but not heavy—getting your attention without demanding it |
| **Padding** | Generous—no rush, take your time with this |
| **Typography** | Match the document—not special, just highlighted |
| **Icons** | Light bulb or similar? Optional. Character doesn't need props. |

**Content Patterns:**

- Lead with the action: "Use X to achieve Y"
- Follow with the benefit: "This preserves context and avoids re-reading"
- Optional expansion: "Consider also..."

**Anti-Patterns (What the Seasoned Colleague Would Never Do):**

- Lecture or condescend
- Use urgent or warning language
- Demand action
- Assume the reader is a beginner
- Over-explain obvious things
- Use corporate jargon

## Step 6: Character Score

### Score: 4.5 / 5

**Breakdown:**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Uniqueness** | 5/5 | Clearly distinct from existing characters (Concierge is formal-helpful; Colleague is warm-practical) |
| **Clarity** | 5/5 | "Seasoned Colleague" immediately evokes the right mental model |
| **Actionability** | 4/5 | Strong voice guidelines; could use more specific visual guidance |
| **Fit** | 4/5 | Captures the green-warmth-practical feel well; "seasoned" might slightly over-age the energy |
| **Memorability** | 5/5 | Easy to remember and apply; natural human analog |

**Why not 5/5:**

The character is strong but could be refined:
- "Seasoned" has slight connotations of age that the youthful mint-green color doesn't fully support
- Alternative consideration: "The Knowing Colleague" or "The Helpful Deskmate"
- The visual-to-character mapping could be tighter (what specific design elements embody "seasoned"?)

**Confidence Level:** High. This character will reliably guide consistent Tip Callout implementations.

**Core Essence:** Peer-to-peer wisdom sharing with warmth

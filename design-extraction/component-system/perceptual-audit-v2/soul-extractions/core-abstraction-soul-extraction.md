## Master Perceptual Truth

"Core Abstraction feels like a well-designed programming textbook opened to a chapter on fundamental principles—the philosophy quote is a pull-quote in a cream inset box, the code block is a specimen listing in dark contrast, and the reader is guided from 'why' to 'how' in a single unified teaching moment."

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...scholarly but approachable, where red ink marks the teacher's annotations..."
2. **Spacing:** "...philosophy quote pressed directly against the code it annotates..."
3. **Container:** "...magazine sidebar or callout box framed for emphasis..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...pull quotes marked with red pen, code in dark inset boxes..."
5. **Composition:** "...meditation garden where each stone (principle) is followed by raked sand (implementation)..."
6. **Color:** "...textbook with margin notes in red ink..."
7. **Layout:** "...teaching textbook page with inset boxes and proof..."

## Character Guidance

**The Sagacious Mentor** pairs wisdom with demonstration. They never lecture without proof, never present principles without showing how they manifest in code.

**Design Mantras:**
- "Here is the principle. Now watch it manifest."
- "Wisdom applied practically."
- "The abstraction revealed at the right level."

**Anti-pattern:** Presenting code without philosophical grounding, or philosophy without implementation proof.

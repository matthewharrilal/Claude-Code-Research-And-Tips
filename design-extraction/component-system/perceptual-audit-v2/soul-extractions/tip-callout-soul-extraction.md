## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...feels like polished technical documentation — professional and readable, but reaching for editorial gravitas..."
2. **Spacing:** "...feels like a well-organized sticky note: compact enough to scan quickly, generous enough not to feel cramped..."
3. **Container:** "...feels like a margin annotation in a well-designed technical book..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...feels like a polite tap on the shoulder — the left border says 'hey, over here'..."
5. **Composition:** "...feels like a calm sidebar whisper..."
6. **Color:** "...feels like a handwritten margin note on quality cream stationery — the green ink faded just enough to be helpful without being insistent..."
7. **Layout:** "...feels like a gentle tap on the shoulder — a self-contained whisper of advice..."

## Character Guidance

**The Seasoned Colleague** speaks as a peer ("I've found that..."), shares from experience not rules, is helpful without being pushy, assumes competence, keeps it conversational.

**Design Mantras:**
- "I've found that..."
- "Here's something useful"
- "Just between us..."

**Anti-pattern:** Lecturing, demanding, or using urgent language.

2. **Missing Focus States** — Links have no focus indicator
3. **Long Code Overflow** — URLs/paths break layout on mobile

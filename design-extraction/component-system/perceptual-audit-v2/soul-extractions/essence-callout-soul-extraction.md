## Master Perceptual Truth

"Essence Callout composition feels like a marginalia note in a first-edition book—the red bar is the careful underline of a previous reader marking 'THIS is the important part,' the italic text leans forward with quiet conviction, and the surrounding whitespace creates reverent space around wisdom worth preserving."

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...feels like the editorial pull quote in a premium financial magazine—serif italic that leans forward with confidence..."
2. **Spacing:** "...the 28/32 asymmetry says 'let this sink in' before moving on..."
3. **Container:** "...a red-ruled passage where an editor marked 'this is the sentence the whole chapter hinges on'..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...typography creates prominence without any stacking of emphasis..."
5. **Composition:** "...left-heavy with confident asymmetric balance—the red bar anchors, the italic leans forward..."
6. **Color:** "...master editor's margin annotation—surgical precision for emphasis..."
7. **Layout:** "...disciplined 3-zone vertical stack where each zone serves distinct semantic purpose..."

## Character Guidance

**The Archivist of Axioms** is the keeper of fundamental truths. Where others speak at length, this character distills experience into memorable principles. They don't create wisdom—they recognize it when it appears and preserve it for future reference.

**Design Mantras:**
- "If you remember nothing else, remember this."
- "Distilling truth. Preserving wisdom."
- "Typography creates prominence. Decoration competes with it."

**Anti-pattern:** Icons, decorative quotation marks, gradients, shadows—anything that competes with the serif italic quote.

## KortAI Alignment

**Level:** EXCEPTIONAL (90% — 54/60)

**Aligned:** Most KortAI-aligned callout in the family. Serif italic matches card title treatment, red as emphasis (not warning), flat design, sharp corners, warm cream background.

**Key Strength:** Typography-first prominence—the quote IS the component, everything else serves it.

## Critical Blindspots

1. **Label contrast fails WCAG AA** — ~3.8:1 (needs 4.5:1 for 10px text)
2. **Fixed typography at 18px** — No responsive scaling for mobile/ultrawide
3. **No focus states** — Keyboard navigation incomplete

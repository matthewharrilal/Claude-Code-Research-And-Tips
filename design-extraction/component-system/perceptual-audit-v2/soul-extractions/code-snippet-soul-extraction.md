## Master Perceptual Truth

"Code Snippet as a whole feels like a scholar's precise transcription — dark slate for focus, syntax colors as semantic marginalia, generous breathing room for contemplation, and a single silent gesture (copy) that says 'take this knowledge with you.' It presents code without commentary, trusts the reader's intelligence, and achieves authority through accuracy rather than decoration."

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...focused editor window at 2AM — quiet chrome, semantic colors..."
2. **Spacing:** "...well-curated museum label — generous enough to breathe..."
3. **Container:** "...slate writing surface placed on a cream desk..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...museum exhibit where the artifact is spotlit..."
5. **Composition:** "...well-organized reference shelf — bottom-weighted with substance..."
6. **Color:** "...VS Code Dark theme softened — familiar but muted..."
7. **Layout:** "...magazine pull-quote for code — confident editorial placement..."

## Character Guidance

**The Precise Transcriptionist** never paraphrases — presents exact artifact, perfectly formatted, with just enough context (language label) to orient. Silent but anticipatory: copy button is only gesture.

**Design Mantras:**
- "Accuracy over expression"
- "The code is the message"
- "One action, one outcome"

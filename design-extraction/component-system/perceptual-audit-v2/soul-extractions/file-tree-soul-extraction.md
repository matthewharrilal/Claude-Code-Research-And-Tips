# File Tree Soul Extraction
## Summary Document

**Named Character:** The Methodical Surveyor
**Soul Alignment Score:** 52/60 (87%)
**Status:** APPROVED

## Master Perceptual Truth

"File Tree feels like a well-organized library card catalog—every item has one exact location, the path to any resource is immediately traceable, and the system trusts you to navigate without hand-holding. It's a reference tool, not a discovery interface."

---

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...monospace precision for structure, editorial sans for explanation..."
2. **Spacing:** "...indentation creates clear hierarchy, surrounding padding treats structure as first-class..."
3. **Container:** "...manuscript page with code annotations—warm cream evokes quality paper..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...blue-colored 'patriarch' folders stand out as landmarks, ASCII shows parent-child..."
5. **Composition:** "...library card catalog—every item has one exact location..."
6. **Color:** "...librarian's catalog card—structure in blue ink, content in black, annotations in gray..."
7. **Layout:** "...terminal window embedded in a magazine page—technical precision meets editorial restraint..."

## Character Guidance

**The Methodical Surveyor** has carefully walked the terrain and offers detailed notes. They map territory with precision, showing the complete structure without hiding anything.

**Design Mantras:**
- "This is where everything lives."
- "The path to any file is immediately traceable."
- "Structure reveals itself through position."

**Anti-pattern:** File manager applications, IDE interfaces, interactive file browsers, folder icons.

## KortAI Alignment

**Level:** STRONG (87% — 26/30)

**Aligned:** Warm cream background, flat design, functional blue for folders, position-based hierarchy, ASCII as visual typography
**Key Adaptation:** Blue instead of red for folders—semantically correct for code context (blue = navigable/link)

---

## Critical Blindspots

1. **Screen reader announces ASCII as characters** — Tree unusable for assistive tech
2. **Long filenames + deep nesting overflow** — Content clips without feedback
3. **Mobile responsive undefined** — 320px viewport breaks layout

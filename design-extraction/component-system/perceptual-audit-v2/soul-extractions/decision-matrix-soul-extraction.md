# Decision Matrix Soul Extraction
## Summary Document

**Named Character:** The Impartial Cartographer
**Soul Alignment Score:** 48.5/60 (81%)
**Status:** APPROVED

---

## Master Perceptual Truth

"Decision Matrix feels like a well-organized reference index in a design annual—typography and whitespace do all the structural work, the red accent marks chapter divisions, and the content trusts readers to navigate without decorative hand-holding."

---

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...four-tier hierarchy; weight contrast creates primary/secondary distinction..."
2. **Spacing:** "...unhurried, scannable, with room for the eye to track across columns..."
3. **Container:** "...content organized through typography and whitespace rather than boxes..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...color accent doing the heavy lifting for section breaks..."
5. **Composition:** "...reference index feel—functional and deliberately unremarkable..."
6. **Color:** "...warm, scholarly document where coral-red ink marks chapter divisions..."
7. **Layout:** "...technical reference card—clean, scannable, professional..."

## Character Guidance

**The Impartial Cartographer** maps the territory of choices without choosing the path. They present facts, not opinions; let comparisons speak; include rationale; and acknowledge tradeoffs.

**Design Mantras:**
- "Here are your options, clearly mapped."
- "Every path has a destination."
- "The territory, not the recommendation."

**Anti-pattern:** Highlighting "recommended" options, traffic light color coding, decorative icons.

## KortAI Alignment

**Level:** STRONG (81% — follows component family patterns)

**Aligned:** Left accent bar, serif italic labels, warm cream background, typography hierarchy, rejection of chrome
**Key Adaptation:** Tables require horizontal reading flow and column structure—applies KortAI principles appropriately

---

## Critical Blindspots

1. **No responsive design** — Mobile usability broken
2. **Missing table caption semantics** — Screen reader accessibility
3. **No scope attributes** — Header association for assistive tech

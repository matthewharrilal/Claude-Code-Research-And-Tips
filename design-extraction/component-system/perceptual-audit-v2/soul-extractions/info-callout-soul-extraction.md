## Master Perceptual Truth

"The Info Callout is a helpful aside that prioritizes function over personality — it whispers 'read this' without making a statement about who it is. Competent utility elevated through editorial typography."

---

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...feels like an editor's annotation in a well-designed annual report — the serif italic label carries earned authority..."
2. **Spacing:** "...breathes you in at top, binds label to message as a single thought, and settles you firmly at the bottom..."
3. **Container:** "...not a box but a breath mark — a single vertical stroke that says 'pause here' without raising its voice..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...flows from anchor to content to annotation — the left bar claims the eye, the body delivers information..."
5. **Composition:** "...a margin annotation given just enough form to exist on screen..."
6. **Color:** "...achieves the soul of a marginalia note penciled onto cream stationery..."
7. **Layout:** "...a whisper in the margin — a left-edge anchor that politely interrupts reading flow..."

## Character Guidance

**The Senior Concierge** provides anticipatory context at thresholds — moments before you commit to an action. Evolved from "The Provident Concierge" to reflect the more confident typography.

**Design Mantras:**
- "A word before you proceed..."
- "The terrace can be brisk — you'll want the cashmere."
- "I mention this with some confidence."

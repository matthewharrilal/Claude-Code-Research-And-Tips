"Reasoning Component feels like a structured analyst's comparison brief in a premium financial publication—two options presented with equal visual weight, no color-coded judgment, culminating in an amber-bordered recommendation that offers wisdom without coercion."

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...analyst's brief; professional categories in red ink, verdict in amber..."

3. **Container:** "...framed editorial panel; bounded analytical space..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...question → debate → verdict; editorial reading flow..."
5. **Composition:** "...academic argument; symmetric tension, authoritative resolution..."
6. **Color:** "...magazine decision matrix; red options, amber takeaway..."
7. **Layout:** "...professional debate format; zones separated by borders..."

**Anti-pattern:** Color-coded columns, pros/cons language, checkmarks, rounded corners.

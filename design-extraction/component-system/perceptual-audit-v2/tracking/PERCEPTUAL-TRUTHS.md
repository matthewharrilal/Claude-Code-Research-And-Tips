**RULE:** Original truths preserved VERBATIM. New structural truths ADDED, not replaced.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## CODE SNIPPET — The Precise Transcriptionist (49/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Code Snippet as a whole feels like a scholar's precise transcription — dark slate for focus, syntax colors as semantic marginalia, generous breathing room for contemplation, and a single silent gesture (copy) that says 'take this knowledge with you.' It presents code without commentary, trusts the reader's intelligence, and achieves authority through accuracy rather than decoration."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "Code Snippet typography feels like a focused editor window at 2AM — quiet chrome, semantic colors that let you read the code's grammar without reading every word, line numbers ghosted so far back they become a ruler you don't consciously see."
2. **Spacing:** "Code Snippet spacing feels like a well-curated museum label — generous enough to let the content breathe but restrained enough to feel purposeful, where every pixel of padding serves readability rather than decoration."
3. **Container:** "The Code Snippet container feels like a slate writing surface placed on a cream desk — grounded and technical where KortAI cards float like paper, but sharing the same philosophy of defining space through material, not decoration."
4. **Hierarchy:** "Code Snippet hierarchy feels like a museum exhibit where the artifact (code) is spotlit in the center, while the wall placard (language label) and exit sign (copy button) are visible but don't compete for attention."
5. **Composition:** "Code Snippet composition feels like a well-organized reference shelf — bottom-weighted with substance, topped by a quiet label, inviting extended study rather than quick glances."
6. **Color:** "Code Snippet color feels like a VS Code Dark theme that has been softened — familiar developer aesthetics with muted saturation, where syntax colors serve genuine comprehension but collectively create an IDE-like experience rather than editorial restraint."
7. **Layout:** "Code Snippet layout feels like a magazine pull-quote for code — confident editorial placement with just enough structure to say 'this is special' without becoming a bordered prison."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Code Snippet's structure feels like a dark window into a technical workspace — two simple zones (label + content) create an inverted editorial space where the dark mass says 'this is different, pay attention' while internal organization remains invisible, trusting the code to speak for itself."**

**Structural Character:**
- Minimal zones (2) — no unnecessary compartmentalization
- Implicit internal separation — whitespace and subtle borders
- Explicit external boundary — color mass defines the component
- Content-driven sizing — grows with code, no arbitrary constraints

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## INFO CALLOUT — The Senior Concierge (53/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"The Info Callout is a helpful aside that prioritizes function over personality — it whispers 'read this' without making a statement about who it is. Competent utility elevated through editorial typography."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...feels like an editor's annotation in a well-designed annual report — the serif italic label carries earned authority..."
2. **Spacing:** "...breathes you in at top, binds label to message as a single thought, and settles you firmly at the bottom..."
3. **Container:** "...not a box but a breath mark — a single vertical stroke that says 'pause here' without raising its voice..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...flows from anchor to content to annotation — the left bar claims the eye, the body delivers information..."
5. **Composition:** "...a margin annotation given just enough form to exist on screen..."
6. **Color:** "...achieves the soul of a marginalia note penciled onto cream stationery..."
7. **Layout:** "...a whisper in the margin — a left-edge anchor that politely interrupts reading flow..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Info Callout's structure feels like a sticky note placed in the margin of a quality book — the left border is the flag tab, the label is the category written at the top, and the content is the note itself. Two simple zones (label + body) create a polite interruption that says 'before you continue, consider this' without raising its voice."**

**Structural Character:**
- Minimal zones (2) — label and body only
- Left anchor — flag-like border creates visual hook
- Implicit internal separation — whitespace between label and body
- Content-defined boundaries — no box, just left flag and padding
- Asymmetric padding — more at bottom (settling space)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## TIP CALLOUT — The Seasoned Colleague (49/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Tip Callout feels like a calm sidebar whisper — visually present enough to catch attention, restrained enough to not interrupt the reading flow, anchored firmly on the left like a trusted guide pointing gently at something useful."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...feels like polished technical documentation — professional and readable, but reaching for editorial gravitas..."
2. **Spacing:** "...feels like a well-organized sticky note: compact enough to scan quickly, generous enough not to feel cramped..."
3. **Container:** "...feels like a margin annotation in a well-designed technical book..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...feels like a polite tap on the shoulder — the left border says 'hey, over here'..."
5. **Composition:** "...feels like a calm sidebar whisper..."
6. **Color:** "...feels like a handwritten margin note on quality cream stationery — the green ink faded just enough to be helpful without being insistent..."
7. **Layout:** "...feels like a gentle tap on the shoulder — a self-contained whisper of advice..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Tip Callout shares Info Callout's exact structural DNA — the only difference is green accent color. Structure creates the callout family identity; color creates semantic differentiation."**

**Structural Character:** IDENTICAL to Info Callout (family DNA)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## GOTCHA CALLOUT — The Vigilant Sentinel (51/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Gotcha Callout functions as a velocity gate rather than a warning box — it briefly interrupts reading momentum, injects critical information, and releases the reader back to their original flow. The red border is a speed bump, not a stop sign."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...feels like an editor's margin warning in a premium publication — the italic uppercase label says 'pay attention' with urgency but not panic..."
2. **Spacing:** "...creates ambient pause without alarm — pink background expands perceived space while accent bar connects to content..."
3. **Container:** "...feels like a red-flagged margin annotation where the editor circled 'THIS WILL BREAK' with a firm but composed hand..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...the red bar activates the warning schema before conscious reading begins — urgency decreases as eye moves through..."
5. **Composition:** "...restful-alert energy — warning urgency tempered by reading calm..."
6. **Color:** "...achieves the soul of a senior editor's red pencil mark in the margin — a single, confident accent that says 'stop and read this'..."
7. **Layout:** "...the 4px red border acts as an attention anchor similar to a sticky note flag in a physical book..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Gotcha Callout shares the callout family structural DNA — red/coral accent creates urgency without panic. Optional pink background tint adds semantic emphasis. Structure is identical; color signals danger."**

**Structural Character:** IDENTICAL to Info Callout (family DNA) with optional tinted background

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## ESSENCE CALLOUT — The Archivist of Axioms (54/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Essence Callout composition feels like a marginalia note in a first-edition book—the red bar is the careful underline of a previous reader marking 'THIS is the important part,' the italic text leans forward with quiet conviction, and the surrounding whitespace creates reverent space around wisdom worth preserving."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...feels like the editorial pull quote in a premium financial magazine—serif italic that leans forward with confidence..."
2. **Spacing:** "...the 28/32 asymmetry says 'let this sink in' before moving on..."
3. **Container:** "...a red-ruled passage where an editor marked 'this is the sentence the whole chapter hinges on'..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...typography creates prominence without any stacking of emphasis..."
5. **Composition:** "...left-heavy with confident asymmetric balance—the red bar anchors, the italic leans forward..."
6. **Color:** "...master editor's margin annotation—surgical precision for emphasis..."
7. **Layout:** "...disciplined 3-zone vertical stack where each zone serves distinct semantic purpose..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Essence Callout is the UNIQUE exception in the callout family — while sharing the same zone structure (label + body), the body zone uses SERIF ITALIC typography instead of sans-serif. This creates editorial pull-quote prominence through typography alone, making it the most KortAI-aligned callout."**

**Structural Character:**
- Same zone structure as Info Callout (label + body)
- UNIQUE body typography — Instrument Serif italic
- Optional attribution zone (em-dash + source)
- Typography creates prominence, not decoration
- Warm amber background tint available

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## CHALLENGE CALLOUT — The Spirited Catalyst (52/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Challenge Callout feels like a friendly mentor tapping your shoulder with an interesting exercise—noticeable but not interruptive, actionable but not urgent. The purple accent invites exploration while the italic serif title leans forward with enthusiasm, not demand."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...editorial sidebar that respects your time while inviting deliberate engagement..."
2. **Spacing:** "...generous enough to command attention, tight enough to feel purposeful..."
3. **Container:** "...sticky note placed in the margin of a technical book..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...friendly mentor tapping your shoulder—purple says 'pay attention' without alarm..."
5. **Composition:** "...safe exploration zone—inviting action without urgency..."
6. **Color:** "...professor's margin note saying 'try this yourself'..."
7. **Layout:** "...friendly sticky note—distinct enough to catch attention, not so loud it disrupts..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Challenge Callout shares the callout family structural DNA — purple accent invites exploration and action. Structure is identical to Info; color signals creative provocation."**

**Structural Character:** IDENTICAL to Info Callout (family DNA)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## FILE TREE — The Methodical Surveyor (52/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"File Tree feels like a well-organized library card catalog—every item has one exact location, the path to any resource is immediately traceable, and the system trusts you to navigate without hand-holding. It's a reference tool, not a discovery interface."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...monospace precision for structure, editorial sans for explanation..."
2. **Spacing:** "...indentation creates clear hierarchy, surrounding padding treats structure as first-class..."
3. **Container:** "...manuscript page with code annotations—warm cream evokes quality paper..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...blue-colored 'patriarch' folders stand out as landmarks, ASCII shows parent-child..."
5. **Composition:** "...library card catalog—every item has one exact location..."
6. **Color:** "...librarian's catalog card—structure in blue ink, content in black, annotations in gray..."
7. **Layout:** "...terminal window embedded in a magazine page—technical precision meets editorial restraint..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"File Tree's structure feels like a librarian's handwritten index card — monospace characters create a precise vertical alignment where indentation IS the hierarchy, ASCII connectors ARE the relationships, and the whole thing trusts the reader to parse structure through position rather than decoration. It's typography as architecture."**

**Structural Character:**
- Typography-based hierarchy — indentation creates depth
- ASCII structural elements — connectors show relationships
- Vertical-dominant flow — entries stack top to bottom
- Rigid horizontal — no wrapping, alignment must be preserved
- Color as landmark — blue folders, gray comments

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## DECISION MATRIX — The Impartial Cartographer (48.5/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Decision Matrix feels like a well-organized reference index in a design annual—typography and whitespace do all the structural work, the red accent marks chapter divisions, and the content trusts readers to navigate without decorative hand-holding."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...four-tier hierarchy; weight contrast creates primary/secondary distinction..."
2. **Spacing:** "...unhurried, scannable, with room for the eye to track across columns..."
3. **Container:** "...content organized through typography and whitespace rather than boxes..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...color accent doing the heavy lifting for section breaks..."
5. **Composition:** "...reference index feel—functional and deliberately unremarkable..."
6. **Color:** "...warm, scholarly document where coral-red ink marks chapter divisions..."
7. **Layout:** "...technical reference card—clean, scannable, professional..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Decision Matrix's structure feels like a well-organized index in a design annual — horizontal rules mark sections, whitespace (not borders) defines columns, and the red accent anchors it as a categorized reference. It's a grid that doesn't feel gridded because vertical lines are absent."**

**Structural Character:**
- True multi-axis — explicit H+V organization
- Whitespace column separation — no vertical prison bars
- Horizontal rules — subtle section breaks
- Left anchor — red accent flags the component
- Scannable rows — eye moves horizontally across

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## CORE ABSTRACTION — The Sagacious Mentor (50.5/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Core Abstraction feels like a well-designed programming textbook opened to a chapter on fundamental principles—the philosophy quote is a pull-quote in a cream inset box, the code block is a specimen listing in dark contrast, and the reader is guided from 'why' to 'how' in a single unified teaching moment."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...scholarly but approachable, where red ink marks the teacher's annotations..."
2. **Spacing:** "...philosophy quote pressed directly against the code it annotates..."
3. **Container:** "...magazine sidebar or callout box framed for emphasis..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...pull quotes marked with red pen, code in dark inset boxes..."
5. **Composition:** "...meditation garden where each stone (principle) is followed by raked sand (implementation)..."
6. **Color:** "...textbook with margin notes in red ink..."
7. **Layout:** "...teaching textbook page with inset boxes and proof..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Core Abstraction's structure feels like a textbook page with a framed pull-quote above a code listing — the 1px border says 'this is a complete thought,' the quote zone delivers philosophy, and the embedded dark code block provides the proof. It's a bounded teaching moment where wisdom meets demonstration."**

**Structural Character:**
- Framed container — 1px border creates bounded space
- Multi-zone vertical flow — label → quote → label → code → commentary
- Composite DNA — combines Essence Callout + Code Snippet
- Embedded contrast — dark code within light frame
- Complete arc — philosophy to demonstration

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## TASK COMPONENT — The Diligent Scribe (51/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Task Component feels like a scholarly margin checklist in a project notebook—the red checkbox is a satisfying mark of completion without gamified dopamine, the strikethrough signals 'finished' without removing visibility, and the grouped lists create manageable chunks of work without overwhelming."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...well-organized project notebook; medium-weight titles, receding descriptions..."
2. **Spacing:** "...legal pad checklist; tasks touch for continuity..."
3. **Container:** "...handwritten checklist entry; subtle border, sharp corners..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...checkbox first, title second, description third, metadata last..."
5. **Composition:** "...scannable work lists; horizontal layout enables quick review..."
6. **Color:** "...red exclusively for status: checkbox, overdue, priority..."
7. **Layout:** "...editorial checklists; header with underline, touching items..."

### Phase 4 Structural Truth (NEW)
**"Task Component's structure feels like a legal pad checklist — checkboxes form a vertical registration line on the left, tasks touch to create workflow continuity, and completed items receive a satisfying strikethrough rather than disappearing. It's productivity without gamification."**

**Structural Character:**
- Checkbox column — vertical registration line
- Content flow — title → description → metadata
- Touching tasks — no gap creates continuity
- Visual completion — strikethrough, not removal
- Progress tracking — header counter shows state

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## REASONING COMPONENT — The Deliberative Counselor (54/60)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Master Soul Truth (Phase 1)
"Reasoning Component feels like a structured analyst's comparison brief in a premium financial publication—two options presented with equal visual weight, no color-coded judgment, culminating in an amber-bordered recommendation that offers wisdom without coercion."

### Phase 1 Zone Truths
1. **Typography:** "...analyst's brief; professional categories in red ink, verdict in amber..."
2. **Spacing:** "...design magazine comparison table; border-mediated separation..."
3. **Container:** "...framed editorial panel; bounded analytical space..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...question → debate → verdict; editorial reading flow..."
5. **Composition:** "...academic argument; symmetric tension, authoritative resolution..."

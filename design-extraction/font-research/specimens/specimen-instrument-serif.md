## Initial Assessment

### Match Quality vs Sanrok Reference: 4.5/5

**IMPORTANT: This is the actual font used on Sanrok's live website.**

**Key Similarities:**
- This IS the font from the Sanrok website
- Condensed editorial proportions match exactly
- Sharp, contemporary feel
- Modern interpretation of Didone genre
- High contrast with refined details

**Key Differences from Reference Images:**
- Reference screenshots may show a different/commercial font (possibly Right Didone)
- Single weight limits flexibility
- No bold weight for emphasis
- Not as extreme contrast as some commercial Didones

### Best Use Case
Perfect for recreating the exact Sanrok look. Ideal for:
- Hero headlines
- Pull quotes
- Editorial headers
- Brand marks/logotypes

### Limitations
- **Single weight only** - cannot create weight hierarchy
- **Display only** - not suitable for body text
- **Requires pairing** - needs a sans-serif for supporting text

### Comparison Notes
Instrument Serif offers the cleanest path to matching Sanrok's actual typography. While the reference design screenshots may show a more elaborate commercial Didone (possibly Right Didone), the live Sanrok site uses Instrument Serif. For maximum authenticity to the actual site, this is the choice. For matching the reference images specifically, consider Right Didone.

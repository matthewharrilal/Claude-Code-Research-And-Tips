## Initial Assessment

### Match Quality vs Sanrok Reference: 5/5

**LIKELY THE EXACT FONT OR CLOSEST MATCH to reference images**

**Key Similarities:**
- Sharp, contemporary Didone aesthetic
- Multiple width options match reference flexibility
- Modern editorial feel
- Large x-height matches reference
- Variable font technology for precise tuning
- Refined but slightly edgy character
- Excellent for fashion/editorial contexts

**Why This May Be The Reference Font:**
- The reference screenshots show a Didone with distinctly modern, non-classical proportions
- Large x-height and condensed options match Right Didone's sub-families
- The "slightly rebellious" character description fits the reference aesthetic
- Width variations (Narrow, Compact, Tight) match different contexts in reference

### Best Use Case
This is the premium choice for matching the Sanrok reference aesthetic:
- Hero headlines with maximum impact
- Fashion/editorial layouts
- Luxury brand typography
- Magazine covers and feature titles
- High-end product marketing

### Commercial Considerations
- **Budget required** - not free for commercial use
- **Trial available** - can test extensively before purchasing
- **License complexity** - need to calculate for web pageviews
- **Value proposition** - extremely comprehensive family

### Comparison Notes
Right Didone represents the contemporary evolution of Didone typography. Unlike historical Bodoni revivals, it brings grotesque-sans DNA into the serif world - resulting in the modern, editorial feel seen in the Sanrok reference. The extensive sub-family system (Tall, Tight, Narrow, Compact, etc.) provides production flexibility that historical revivals cannot match.

**Recommendation:** Primary choice if budget allows. Test trial version first to confirm match with reference images.

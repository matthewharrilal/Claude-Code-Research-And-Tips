## Initial Assessment

### Match Quality vs Sanrok Reference: 4/5

**Key Similarities:**
- High contrast with sharp details
- Editorial, sophisticated character
- Strong personality without being theatrical
- Tight spacing suits headline use
- Multiple weights for hierarchy
- Professional, award-winning quality

**Key Differences:**
- Wedge serifs vs. hairline serifs in reference
- More transitional than pure Didone
- Character feels slightly more "fierce" than "smooth"
- Different serif construction than Bodoni-derived designs
- Higher minimum investment than some alternatives

### Best Use Case
Premium editorial design requiring sophistication with edge:
- Magazine headlines and features
- Luxury brand identity
- Book covers (literary fiction, non-fiction)
- High-end corporate communications
- Award-winning design contexts

### Notable Users
- **Medium** (brand typeface)
- Various high-profile editorial and corporate clients

### Commercial Considerations
- **Premium pricing** - significant investment
- **No variable font** - less technical flexibility
- **Proven track record** - used by major brands
- **Award-winning** - Cooper Hewitt Collection, multiple design awards
- **Three subfamilies** - Display, Standard, Text cover all sizes

### Comparison Notes
Noe Display represents a different approach than Right Didone. Where Right Didone brings grotesque DNA to Didone, Noe Display blends French and British transitional traditions into something fierce yet disciplined. The wedge serifs and beaked terminals give it a unique voice that's editorial but not pure Didone.

For the Sanrok reference specifically, Noe Display may feel slightly more "designed" and less classically Didone. However, its professional pedigree and multiple size-optimized families make it excellent for complete typographic systems.

**Recommendation:** Excellent choice for premium projects where budget supports quality. Consider if the wedge-serif aesthetic aligns with project direction.

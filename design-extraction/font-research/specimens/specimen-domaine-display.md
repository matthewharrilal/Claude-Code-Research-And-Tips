## Initial Assessment

### Match Quality vs Sanrok Reference: 3.5/5

**Key Similarities:**
- High contrast with elegant details
- Editorial, sophisticated character
- Professional quality from renowned foundry
- Multiple weights for complete hierarchy
- Condensed and narrow variants available
- Award-winning design

**Key Differences:**
- **Bracketed serifs** - reference shows hairline/unbracketed
- **More transitional** - reference is more purely Didone
- **Different terminal style** - hooked vs. ball
- **Slightly warmer** - reference feels sharper
- **Different proportions** - reference more condensed

### Best Use Case
Premium editorial and brand design:
- Sophisticated magazine layouts
- High-end brand identities
- Book design (especially literary)
- Refined corporate communications
- When "elegant" is more important than "sharp"

### Notable Recognition
- Cooper Hewitt Collection (2016)
- Australian Design Biennale Distinction (2014)
- Tokyo Type Directors Club Prize Nominee (2014)
- Best Awards Gold Pin (2013)

### Commercial Considerations
- **Klim quality** - industry-leading foundry
- **Reasonable pricing** - $60 base with good discounts
- **Perpetual license** - no ongoing costs
- **Complete family system** - Display, Text, Sans variants
- **Proven reputation** - widely used professionally

### Comparison Notes
Domaine Display is beautiful but represents a slightly different aesthetic than the Sanrok reference. Where the reference shows sharp, hairline-serif Didone influence, Domaine offers gently bracketed, transitional elegance. The hooked terminals and warmer character make it feel more "refined European" than "sharp editorial."

For the Sanrok aesthetic specifically, Domaine may feel slightly too soft. However, if the project direction allows for interpretation rather than exact matching, Domaine's quality and comprehensive family make it an excellent professional choice.

**Recommendation:** Consider for projects prioritizing elegance over sharpness. Excellent quality, but may not be the closest match to reference.

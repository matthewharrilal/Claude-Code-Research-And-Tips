## Typographic DNA Summary

### Primary Identification Features

1. **Extreme stroke contrast** (1:8 to 1:10 ratio)
2. **Vertical stress** on all rounded forms
3. **Unbracketed hairline serifs**
4. **Horizontal terminals** on S, C, G
5. **Pointed apexes** on A, W, M
6. **Calligraphic R leg** with subtle curve
7. **Closed G spur** extending into counter

### Classification

**Primary:** Didone/Modern
**Sub-classification:** Display Didone
**Era inspiration:** Early 19th century (Bodoni/Didot lineage)
**Modern interpretation:** Contemporary refinement for digital display

### Possible Font Identification

Based on these characteristics, this appears to be either:
- A custom typeface for Sanrok
- A high-quality Didone display face such as:
  - **Freight Big Pro**
  - **Canela**
  - **Noe Display**
  - **Romana** family
  - **Didot** variations
  - **Domaine Display**

The specific characteristics (especially the R leg and overall proportions) suggest this may be **Canela** or a similar contemporary Didone designed for editorial use.

## Usage Notes

### Optimal Use Cases
- Headlines and hero text
- Editorial titles
- Brand statements
- Large display sizes (40px+)

### Cautions
- Hairlines may disappear at small sizes
- Requires good contrast ratios for accessibility
- Print reproduction needs high-quality output

### Pairing Recommendations
- Pair with a clean sans-serif for body text
- Use the italic sparingly for emphasis
- Outline version adds visual variety without adding weight

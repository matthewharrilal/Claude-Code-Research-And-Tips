# Comparison: Bodoni Moda vs Sanrok Reference

## Overall Match Score: 28/40 (3.5/5 average across 8 letters)

## Font Overview

**Bodoni Moda** is a faithful digital revival of Giambattista Bodoni's original designs, created by Owen Earl at Indestructible Type. Released in 2020, it emphasizes historical accuracy with eight optical sizes (06-96pt), making it technically superior for both text and display use. Available free on Google Fonts with variable font technology.

**Design Philosophy:** "The ultimate digital realization of [Bodoni's] ideas" - aims for historical authenticity over contemporary interpretation.

## Critical Letters

### Letter R (Most Important)

- **Reference:** Curved calligraphic leg sweeping from bowl junction, graceful diagonal extension with slight taper
- **Bodoni Moda:** Traditional curved calligraphic tail, classic Bodoni R construction. The leg curves outward from the bowl junction with a sweeping motion, ending in a ball terminal on some optical sizes
- **Match:** CLOSE - Both have curved legs, but Bodoni Moda's curve is more pronounced and classical. The reference appears to have a more restrained, contemporary curve
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter S

- **Reference:** Flowing double curve with extreme contrast at spine, horizontal shear terminals facing outward
- **Bodoni Moda:** Classical Bodoni S with pronounced ball terminals at top and bottom, extreme contrast at spine (nearly disappearing at thinnest point), smooth flowing curves
- **Match:** VERY CLOSE - The stroke contrast is comparable. Main difference is terminal style: Bodoni Moda has more pronounced ball terminals whereas reference shows horizontal shear cuts
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter G

- **Reference:** Has horizontal spur extending into counter, based on O form with vertical stress
- **Bodoni Moda:** Traditional Bodoni G with minimal or no spur. Counter more open than reference. The beard terminates without the characteristic horizontal spur found in the reference
- **Match:** DIFFERENT - This is a significant distinguishing characteristic. Bodoni Moda's G lacks the distinctive horizontal spur that extends into the counter
- **Score:** 2/5

## Supporting Letters

### Letter A

- **Reference:** Pointed sharp apex, asymmetric stroke weights (thin left, thick right), low crossbar (1/3 from baseline)
- **Bodoni Moda:** Sharp pointed apex, classic contrast pattern with thin left diagonal and thick right diagonal, crossbar positioned traditionally
- **Match:** VERY CLOSE - Construction is nearly identical, classic Didone A form
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter W

- **Reference:** Sharp pointed apexes at center, thick outer strokes, thin inner strokes
- **Bodoni Moda:** Four diagonal strokes meeting at two apexes, extreme contrast between thick outer and thin inner strokes, pointed apex vertices
- **Match:** VERY CLOSE - Both follow classical high-contrast W construction
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter E

- **Reference:** Heavy vertical stem, three thin horizontal arms (all hairlines), middle bar slightly shorter
- **Bodoni Moda:** Classic Bodoni E with extreme vertical/horizontal contrast, hairline arms, optically centered middle bar
- **Match:** CLOSE - Very similar construction, Bodoni Moda may appear slightly wider in proportions
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter O

- **Reference:** Circular to slightly oval, vertical stress axis, thins at 12/6 o'clock, thicks at 3/9 o'clock
- **Bodoni Moda:** Classic Bodoni O with strong vertical stress, extreme thin points at top/bottom, thick at sides. More circular than oval
- **Match:** VERY CLOSE - Quintessential Didone O construction shared by both
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter K

- **Reference:** Heavy vertical stem, thin upper arm extending up-right, thick lower leg extending down-right, junction above center
- **Bodoni Moda:** Traditional Bodoni K with asymmetric diagonal weights (thin arm, thick leg), junction point creates negative space pocket
- **Match:** CLOSE - Same construction principle, Bodoni Moda may have slightly different junction placement
- **Score:** 3/5

## Summary

### Strengths (where this font matches well):

- Extreme stroke contrast is authentic to Didone classification
- Unbracketed hairline serifs match reference exactly
- R leg has curved calligraphic quality (though more pronounced)
- Sharp apexes on A, W match reference
- Vertical stress throughout
- Extensive weight range and optical sizes provide flexibility
- Free and technically excellent

### Weaknesses (where this font differs):

- **G spur is absent** - Reference has distinctive horizontal spur into counter
- More traditional/scholarly feel vs. reference's contemporary editorial edge
- Ball terminals more pronounced than reference's horizontal shear cuts on S, C
- Slightly wider proportions give less condensed feeling
- Overall aesthetic is "historical revival" rather than "modern fashion editorial"

### Overall Assessment

Bodoni Moda is an excellent technical Bodoni with high fidelity to the original designs. It captures the essential Didone characteristics (extreme contrast, hairline serifs, vertical stress) effectively. However, it reads as a historical revival rather than a contemporary interpretation. The missing G spur is a notable distinguishing feature. For projects requiring authentic Bodoni typography, this is the best free option. For capturing the specific Sanrok editorial aesthetic, it may feel too traditional.

**Recommendation:** Best for projects prioritizing typographic authenticity over contemporary editorial feel. The optical sizing makes it exceptionally versatile for both display and text use.

### Match Rating: 3.5/5

## Overall Match Score: 24/40 (3.0/5 average across 8 letters)

**Design Philosophy:** Historical revival optimized for web readability - prioritizes warm, approachable Bodoni over sharp editorial edge.

## Critical Letters

### Letter R (Most Important)

- **Reference:** Curved calligraphic leg sweeping from bowl junction, graceful diagonal extension with slight taper
- **Libre Bodoni:** Traditional curved tail in the classical Bodoni manner. The leg has a generous calligraphic curve extending from the bowl, terminating in a pronounced ball terminal
- **Match:** SIMILAR STYLE but different execution. Libre Bodoni's R feels "warmer" and more rounded. The curve is present but has a softer, more classical feel rather than the sharp contemporary sweep of the reference
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter S

- **Reference:** Flowing double curve with extreme contrast at spine, horizontal shear terminals facing outward
- **Libre Bodoni:** Classical S with pronounced ball terminals at top and bottom. Good contrast at spine, but terminals are distinctly ball-shaped rather than horizontal shear
- **Match:** DIFFERENT in terminal treatment. The ball terminals give a warmer, more traditional feel vs. the sharper reference
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter G

- **Reference:** Has horizontal spur extending into counter
- **Libre Bodoni:** Subtle spur present but not prominent. The G has an open counter with a refined beard that hints at a spur without the dramatic horizontal extension into the counter
- **Match:** PARTIALLY MATCHES - spur exists but is understated compared to reference
- **Score:** 3/5

## Supporting Letters

### Letter A

- **Reference:** Pointed sharp apex, asymmetric stroke weights, low crossbar
- **Libre Bodoni:** Classical pointed apex with traditional contrast. Wider proportions than reference. Crossbar positioned traditionally
- **Match:** SIMILAR construction but wider proportions dilute the sharp impact
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter W

- **Reference:** Sharp pointed apexes, thick outer/thin inner strokes
- **Libre Bodoni:** Classical W construction with appropriate contrast, wider setting than reference
- **Match:** CLOSE in construction, different in proportions (wider)
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter E

- **Reference:** Heavy vertical stem, hairline horizontal arms, middle bar slightly shorter
- **Libre Bodoni:** Traditional E with good contrast, slightly wider proportions. The hairlines are refined but not as extreme
- **Match:** CLOSE - good contrast but proportions differ
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter O

- **Reference:** Circular to slightly oval, vertical stress, extreme thin points
- **Libre Bodoni:** Classical Bodoni O with vertical stress, more oval than the reference. Thins are refined but not disappearing-thin
- **Match:** CLOSE - shares vertical stress and Didone construction
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter K

- **Reference:** Heavy stem, thin upper arm, thick lower leg
- **Libre Bodoni:** Traditional K with asymmetric diagonal weights, classical proportions

## Summary

### Strengths (where this font matches well):

- Unbracketed hairline serifs align with Didone classification
- Vertical stress throughout
- Good stroke contrast (very high, if not extreme)
- Multiple weights available (Regular to Bold)
- Variable font support
- Free on Google Fonts
- Excellent screen rendering optimization
- True italics included

### Weaknesses (where this font differs):

- **Wider proportions** - loses the condensed editorial tension
- **Ball terminals** - distinctly ball-shaped vs. horizontal shear
- **G spur understated** - present but not the dramatic feature of reference
- **Warmer character** - feels scholarly rather than fashion-editorial
- **Larger x-height** - changes the vertical rhythm
- **No extreme weights** - starts at Regular (400), no light or ultra-bold
- **No optical sizes** - unlike Bodoni Moda, not optimized for size extremes

### Overall Assessment

Libre Bodoni is a quality web-optimized Bodoni revival that shares the fundamental Didone characteristics (unbracketed serifs, high contrast, vertical stress) with the reference. However, its wider proportions and warmer character create a distinctly different impression.

Where the reference feels sharp, condensed, and fashion-forward, Libre Bodoni feels warm, approachable, and scholarly. It's based on the ATF Bodoni which was itself a more readable interpretation of Bodoni's designs.

The font works well for projects requiring classical elegance and good readability, but it doesn't capture the contemporary editorial tension of the Sanrok reference.

**Key Issue:** The fundamental character is "warm classical" rather than "sharp contemporary" - this is a philosophical difference, not just a technical one.

**Recommendation:** Use for projects prioritizing readability and classical elegance. Not recommended when trying to match the sharp editorial aesthetic of Sanrok's design system.

### Match Rating: 3.0/5

## Comparison with Bodoni Moda

| Aspect | Libre Bodoni | Bodoni Moda |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Width | Wider | More classical/moderate |
| Contrast | Very high | Extreme |
| Optical sizes | No | Yes (8 sizes) |
| Weight range | 400-700 | 400-900 |
| Character | Warm, approachable | Classical, scholarly |
| G spur | Subtle | Absent |
| Better for | Web body text | Display headlines |

**Verdict:** Between the two free Bodoni options, Bodoni Moda is closer to the Sanrok reference for display use, while Libre Bodoni may work better if you need a Bodoni for longer text passages.

# Comparison: Instrument Serif vs Sanrok Reference

## Overall Match Score: 30/40 (3.75/5 average across 8 letters)

## Font Overview

**Instrument Serif** is a condensed display serif designed specifically for the Instrument design agency's brand identity. Created by Rodrigo Fuenzalida with direction from Jordan Egstad, released in 2022. A contemporary interpretation of old style serif characteristics optimized for large display sizes.

**Critical Note:** This is the **actual font confirmed to be used on Sanrok's live website**, though the reference design images may showcase different/custom typography.

**Design Philosophy:** "A contemporary take on some of our favorite old style serifs" - prioritizes modern editorial feel over historical accuracy.

## Critical Letters

### Letter R (Most Important)

- **Reference:** Curved calligraphic leg sweeping from bowl junction, graceful diagonal extension
- **Instrument Serif:** More restrained leg with a slight kick rather than full calligraphic curve. The leg is straighter with subtle outward movement, less flowing than classical Bodoni
- **Match:** CLOSE - Both share a curved element, but Instrument Serif's R leg is more contemporary/restrained. Not the dramatic calligraphic sweep of the reference
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter S

- **Reference:** Flowing double curve with extreme contrast at spine, horizontal shear terminals
- **Instrument Serif:** High-contrast S with sharp wedge-shaped terminals. The spine shows strong contrast but terminals have a contemporary sharpness rather than horizontal shear
- **Match:** CLOSE - Similar contrast level, but terminal treatment differs. Instrument Serif has sharper, more angular terminals
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter G

- **Reference:** Has horizontal spur extending into counter
- **Instrument Serif:** Small, refined spur present. The G has a contemporary treatment with a subtle beard/spur that doesn't extend as dramatically into the counter as the reference
- **Match:** CLOSE - Spur is present but more subtle than reference
- **Score:** 4/5

## Supporting Letters

### Letter A

- **Reference:** Pointed sharp apex, asymmetric stroke weights, low crossbar
- **Instrument Serif:** Sharp apex with contemporary proportions, classic thick/thin contrast, crossbar placement is modern and refined
- **Match:** VERY CLOSE - Clean, sharp execution matching editorial style
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter W

- **Reference:** Sharp pointed apexes, thick outer/thin inner strokes
- **Instrument Serif:** Contemporary W with high contrast, pointed center apexes, condensed proportions fitting the narrow design
- **Match:** VERY CLOSE - Matches well, condensed proportions align with reference
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter E

- **Reference:** Heavy vertical stem, hairline horizontal arms
- **Instrument Serif:** Strong contrast E with sharp details, the hairlines are refined rather than extreme. More contemporary feel
- **Match:** CLOSE - Good contrast but not as extreme as pure Didone reference
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter O

- **Reference:** Circular with vertical stress, extreme thin points
- **Instrument Serif:** Vertical stress maintained, condensed proportions make O slightly more oval. Contrast is high but not extreme Didone level
- **Match:** CLOSE - Vertical stress matches, but proportions are more condensed/contemporary
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter K

- **Reference:** Heavy stem, thin upper arm, thick lower leg
- **Instrument Serif:** Contemporary K with asymmetric diagonal weights, sharp angular connection
- **Match:** CLOSE - Similar construction principle with modern refinement
- **Score:** 3/5

## Summary

### Strengths (where this font matches well):

- **Confirmed as the actual Sanrok website font**
- Condensed proportions match display usage in reference
- Contemporary editorial aesthetic aligns with Sanrok's brand feel
- Sharp, modern details without being overly decorative
- G has a spur (even if subtle)
- Optimized for display sizes (same use case as reference)
- Free and easily accessible
- Pairs excellently with Inter (also used by Sanrok)

### Weaknesses (where this font differs):

- **Single weight only** - no bold or light variants for hierarchy
- Less extreme stroke contrast than pure Didone reference
- R leg is more restrained, less calligraphic sweep
- S terminals are angular rather than horizontal shear
- Classified as old style, not Didone - fundamentally different genre
- Cannot create outline/filled variations in same family
- Limited to display use only

### Overall Assessment

Instrument Serif is the verified font from Sanrok's live website, making it the most authentic choice for replicating their actual typography. However, the reference design images appear to show a different, more extreme Didone typeface (possibly custom or a commercial font like Right Didone).

The font captures the condensed, contemporary editorial aesthetic effectively, even though it technically belongs to the old style classification rather than Didone. Its high (but not extreme) contrast and sharp contemporary details give it a modern edge that aligns with Sanrok's brand personality.

**Key Trade-off:** Authenticity to the live Sanrok website (use Instrument Serif) vs. authenticity to the reference design screenshots (consider Right Didone or Bodoni Moda).

**Recommendation:** Use Instrument Serif if you want to match the actual Sanrok website exactly. If matching the more elaborate Didone style shown in reference design images, consider Right Didone as a companion for hero moments.

### Match Rating: 3.75/5

# Comparison: Abril Fatface vs Sanrok Reference

## Overall Match Score: 26/40 (3.25/5 average across 8 letters)

## Font Overview

**Abril Fatface** is a contemporary display typeface designed by Veronika Burian and Jose Scaglione at TypeTogether. Part of the larger Abril family (22 styles), the Fatface weight is a bold, high-impact Didone inspired by 19th century British and French advertising poster types.

**Design Philosophy:** "Contemporary revamp of classic Didone styles" - captures the bold presence of Victorian fat face advertising typography with modern refinement.

**Important Note:** Only the Fatface weight is freely available on Google Fonts. The full Abril family (including lighter display and text weights) is a commercial product.

## Critical Letters

### Letter R (Most Important)

- **Reference:** Curved calligraphic leg sweeping from bowl junction, graceful diagonal extension
- **Abril Fatface:** Bold R with a curved leg characteristic of fat face types. The leg has a generous sweep from the bowl, though the extreme weight makes it appear more substantial. Less flowing/calligraphic than lighter Didones - more poster-like presence
- **Match:** SIMILAR in principle (curved leg) but different in execution. The fat face weight creates a bolder, more impactful R rather than the elegant sweep of the reference
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter S

- **Reference:** Flowing double curve with extreme contrast at spine, horizontal shear terminals
- **Abril Fatface:** Bold S with substantial curves. The spine still shows contrast but with more body due to fat face weight. Terminals described as "chiseled, leaden ball terminals" - more substantial than reference's horizontal shear
- **Match:** DIFFERENT feel - the fat face weight changes the character from elegant to bold. Terminals are ball-shaped rather than horizontal shear
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter G

- **Reference:** Has horizontal spur extending into counter
- **Abril Fatface:** The G has a refined treatment with a beard/spur element. Fat face typography often emphasizes these details. Spur present but the overall bold weight changes the visual balance
- **Match:** CLOSE - spur element exists, but overall character differs due to weight
- **Score:** 4/5

## Supporting Letters

### Letter A

- **Reference:** Pointed sharp apex, asymmetric stroke weights, low crossbar
- **Abril Fatface:** Bold A with sharp apex, extreme thick/thin contrast even in fat face weight. The apex comes to a refined point despite the overall boldness
- **Match:** CLOSE - apex treatment is similar, but overall weight is bolder
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter W

- **Reference:** Sharp pointed apexes, thick outer/thin inner strokes
- **Abril Fatface:** Bold W with maintained contrast (thick outer, thin inner strokes). The apexes remain sharp. Fat face styling creates more visual impact
- **Match:** CLOSE - structure matches, just bolder execution
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter E

- **Reference:** Heavy vertical stem, hairline horizontal arms
- **Abril Fatface:** Very heavy vertical stem with contrasting horizontal arms. The arms retain their hairline quality even with the bold vertical
- **Match:** SIMILAR - maintains extreme contrast principle
- **Score:** 3/5

### Letter O

- **Reference:** Circular to slightly oval, vertical stress, extreme thin points
- **Abril Fatface:** Bold O with vertical stress, thin points at top/bottom nearly disappear creating dramatic contrast with the thick sides
- **Match:** CLOSE - vertical stress and contrast are strong matches
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter K

- **Reference:** Heavy stem, thin upper arm, thick lower leg
- **Abril Fatface:** Bold K with asymmetric diagonals, the contrast between thin upper arm and thick lower leg is pronounced
- **Match:** SIMILAR - follows the same contrast principle with more impact
- **Score:** 3/5

## The Fat Face Context

**Historical Note:** Fat face typefaces emerged in early 19th century Britain for advertising. They took Didone characteristics (extreme contrast, hairline serifs) and pushed the thick strokes to maximum boldness for visual impact on posters.

Abril Fatface captures this heritage:
- "Reflects the heavy titling fonts of the advertising posters in Britain and France in the nineteenth century"
- "Thin serifs and clean curves make the typeface look classy"
- "Provides any headline with a certain air of sophistication"

This is a different design intent than the reference's editorial elegance, but shares the same Didone DNA.

## Summary

### Strengths (where this font matches well):

- **Extreme stroke contrast** - even more pronounced than reference
- **Unbracketed hairline serifs** - maintains this despite bold weight
- **Sharp apexes** on A, W maintain refined points
- **Vertical stress** throughout
- **G has spur** element
- **Free** on Google Fonts
- **Contemporary refinement** of Didone principles
- **High impact** for headlines
- **Ball terminals** described as "chiseled" - adds sophistication

### Weaknesses (where this font differs):

- **Only Fatface weight available free** - no lighter weights for variety
- **No italic** - limited stylistic flexibility
- **Fat face character** - bolder than reference's elegant display
- **Poster proportions** - slightly wider than editorial condensed
- **Ball terminals** rather than horizontal shear on S, C
- **Different era evoked** - advertising poster vs. fashion editorial
- **Cannot create hierarchy** with weight alone (single weight)
- **Too bold** for secondary headlines or body use

### Overall Assessment

Abril Fatface is a quality contemporary Didone that shares core characteristics with the reference (extreme contrast, hairline serifs, vertical stress). However, its fat face heritage creates a fundamentally different character - bold advertising impact vs. elegant editorial refinement.

The typeface excels for maximum visual impact headlines where you want to command attention. It's less suitable for the subtle sophistication of editorial design where the reference font operates.

**Key Trade-off:** Abril Fatface trades elegance for impact. Use it when you want headlines that demand attention, not when you want the refined editorial presence of the Sanrok reference.

**Recommendation:** Excellent for bold hero moments, pull quotes requiring impact, and poster-style applications. Less suitable for the layered, sophisticated editorial typography of the Sanrok design system.

### Match Rating: 3.25/5

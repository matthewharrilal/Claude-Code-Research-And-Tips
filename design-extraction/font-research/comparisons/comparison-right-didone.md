## Critical Letters

### Letter R (Most Important)

- **Reference:** Curved calligraphic leg sweeping from bowl junction, graceful diagonal extension with slight taper
- **Right Didone:** Contemporary R with a refined leg that maintains the curved character of Didones but with modern restraint. The grotesque heritage influences the leg to be slightly more geometric while retaining the essential sweep. Less ornate than classical Bodoni but more dynamic
- **Match:** CLOSE - captures the curved leg essence with a contemporary interpretation that aligns with the reference's modern editorial feel
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter S

- **Reference:** Flowing double curve with extreme contrast at spine, horizontal shear terminals facing outward
- **Right Didone:** Contemporary S with high contrast at the spine. Terminals show the "edgy and sharp" quality described in the font's character. More aligned with contemporary editorial than classical ball terminals
- **Match:** VERY CLOSE - the contemporary edge of Right Didone matches the reference's modern character
- **Score:** 4/5

### Letter G

- **Reference:** Has horizontal spur extending into counter
- **Right Didone:** Contemporary G treatment with spur element. The grotesque heritage gives a slightly different construction, but the Didone refinement adds the classical elements including spur treatment
- **Match:** CLOSE - spur present with contemporary interpretation
- **Score:** 4/5

## The Contemporary Didone Advantage

Right Didone specifically addresses the challenge of creating a Didone for contemporary use:

> "Where classic sophistication gets a contemporary reboot - with a few quirks and a whole lot of contrast."

**Why This Matters for Sanrok Reference Match:**

1. **Contemporary Edge:** The reference shows a modern editorial Didone, not a historical revival
2. **Versatility:** Multiple widths allow matching the exact proportions needed
3. **Large X-Height:** Improves readability at smaller sizes (modern consideration)
4. **Variable Technology:** Precise control over weight and width
5. **Includes Outline Styles:** Matches the filled/outline treatment in reference

### Overall Assessment

Right Didone is the **strongest match** for the Sanrok reference among all candidates analyzed. Its contemporary interpretation of Didone principles aligns with the modern editorial aesthetic of the reference. The multiple width subfamilies (especially Tight and Narrow) allow precise matching of the condensed display proportions.

The grotesque heritage gives Right Didone a unique character that feels fresh rather than derivative - exactly what the Sanrok reference typography embodies: honoring classical forms while pushing them forward.

**Key Advantage:** Right Didone was designed for exactly the use case the Sanrok reference represents - contemporary editorial display with Didone heritage. This philosophical alignment makes it the closest match beyond surface letterform comparison.

**Recommendation:** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for matching the Sanrok aesthetic. Start with Right Didone Tight or Narrow for condensed editorial headlines. The commercial licensing cost is justified by the precision match and flexibility.

# AD-006 Cold Look — Auditor A (Impression + Emotion)

## COLD LOOK (1440px):
Gut reaction: Scholarly and warm — like a well-typeset architecture journal, confident but the vast empty cream space between the dark header and the first section heading feels like a held breath that goes on too long.
Worst thing: The enormous vertical gap between the bottom of the dark hero banner and the start of "Section 01" content — the page feels like it forgot to load something in that void.
Best thing: The serif title "AD-006: The Convergence" against the dark band — it immediately signals authority and intentionality, and the small pattern-echo grid diagrams are delightful miniatures.
Ship verdict: YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## COLD LOOK (768px):
Gut reaction: Much tighter and more purposeful — the narrow column forces content together and eliminates the empty-breath problem of the wide view; the page now feels like a focused document rather than a gallery wall.
Worst thing: The pattern-echo grid diagrams sit beside the body text in a cramped two-column arrangement — at this width the miniature boxes barely read as diagrams and look more like smudged stamps.
Best thing: The section header hierarchy is much stronger at this width — "Section 01" label into the serif heading into body text has clear vertical rhythm that the wide layout diluted with side-by-side positioning.
Ship verdict: YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## COLD LOOK (1024px):
Gut reaction: Confident and well-composed — sits between the spacious 1440px version and the 768px version. The layout holds together well at this width.
Worst thing: The gap between the header and Section 01 still feels excessive, though less dramatic than at 1440px.
Best thing: Tables and multi-column content feel naturally proportioned — not cramped, not stretched.
Ship verdict: YES WITH RESERVATIONS

## NOTE — Scroll-Through at 768px revealed WOULD-NOT-SHIP findings
The 768px Cold Look above is LOCKED (per protocol — records first impression of the header area). The full scroll-through at 768px revealed catastrophic bento grid crushing starting in Section 03, with text stacking one character per line. See findings-impression-emotion.md for full details.

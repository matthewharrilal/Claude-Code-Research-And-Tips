## Initial Assessment

### Match Quality vs Sanrok Reference: 3.5/5

**Key Similarities:**
- Extreme stroke contrast matches Didone genre
- Hairline serifs match reference style
- Ball terminals present
- High-quality digital rendering
- Multiple weights for flexibility

**Key Differences:**
- More classical/conservative feel than the reference
- Slightly narrower letterforms
- Less contemporary edge - more traditional Bodoni revival
- R leg more curved/calligraphic vs. the straighter feel in reference
- Overall feeling is "scholarly" rather than "editorial fashion"

### Best Use Case
When you need an authentic, complete Bodoni family with full technical features at no cost. The optical sizes make this exceptional for body text use - rare for a display-oriented Didone.

### Comparison Notes
Bodoni Moda is the most technically complete free Bodoni available. However, it leans toward historical accuracy over contemporary editorial style. For a Sanrok-like aesthetic, it may feel slightly too traditional. Consider pairing with a geometric sans to modernize the feel.

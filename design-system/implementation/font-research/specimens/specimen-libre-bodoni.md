## Initial Assessment

### Match Quality vs Sanrok Reference: 3/5

**Key Similarities:**
- Extreme stroke contrast matches Didone genre
- Hairline serifs
- Ball terminals present
- Multiple weights available
- Good web rendering

**Key Differences:**
- More traditional/classical feel
- Wider letterforms than the reference
- Less contemporary, more historical revival
- Ball terminals more pronounced than modern Didones
- Overall character feels "warmer" and less sharp

### Best Use Case
When you need a readable, web-optimized Bodoni with multiple weights. Better suited for:
- Longer headlines (better readability)
- Subheads and pull quotes
- Situations requiring weight variations within serif text

### Limitations
- **No light weight** - starts at Regular
- **No optical sizes** - less refined at extremes
- **Traditional aesthetic** - doesn't capture contemporary editorial feel

### Comparison Notes
Libre Bodoni is more faithful to historical Bodoni than to contemporary editorial Didones. It's an excellent free Bodoni for general use, but for matching the Sanrok reference aesthetic specifically, it feels too traditional. The wider proportions and warmer character work against the sharp, condensed editorial look of the reference.

**Recommendation:** Use for projects requiring classic elegance over contemporary edge.

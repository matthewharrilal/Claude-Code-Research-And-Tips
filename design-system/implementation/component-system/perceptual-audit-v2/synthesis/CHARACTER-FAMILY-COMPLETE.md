## THREADING: What This File Establishes

This file is the **definitive character identity authority** for the KortAI design system. It establishes:

| Established Artifact | Count | Detail |
|---------------------|-------|--------|
| Master character | 1 | "The Unhurried Editor" — overall system personality |
| Component characters | 11 | Named personalities with unique, non-overlapping qualities |
| Soul scores | 11 | Range: 48.5/60 (Decision Matrix) to 54/60 (Essence + Reasoning), average 51.4/60 (86%) |
| Mantras | 33 | 3 per component — voice expressions for each character |
| Structural profiles | 11 | Zone structure, structural role, density contribution, zone separation, axis behavior |
| Visual metaphors | 11 | One per component (e.g., "dark window on a cream desk" for Code Snippet) |
| Uniqueness matrix | 12 | Verification that all characters have non-overlapping core qualities |
| Family coherence score | 1 | 5/5 — all criteria met |

**Key structural insight:** The callout family (Info, Tip, Gotcha, Essence, Challenge) shares DNA — 2-zone + left accent flag — but each differentiates through soul role, color flag, and structural contribution. Essence breaks from the family with its serif italic body (Instrument Serif). Core Abstraction is explicitly COMPOSITE, combining Essence Callout + Code Snippet DNA.

## THREADING: Soul Alignment

| Soul Piece | How This File Aligns |
|------------|---------------------|
| Editorial Restraint | Master character "The Unhurried Editor" embodies this directly: "Nothing to prove," "restraint over decoration" |
| Typography as Primary Tool | Structural profiles use typography as hierarchy (serif display vs. sans metadata), File Tree uses "typography IS architecture" |
| Confident Precision | Sharp edges as confidence markers in master character; "Accuracy over expression" (Code Snippet) |
| Content Authority | "We don't explain. We present. The reader is intelligent." — Master character voice |
| Intentional Whitespace | Structural profiles define density contributions (LOW for Essence = reverent breathing room, HIGH for File Tree = dense but structured) |

**This file does not define CSS tokens.** It defines character-level soul alignment — the personality layer that sits ABOVE tokens and BELOW implementation. Downstream work must translate characters into visual decisions that honor both the character identity AND the locked token values in DESIGN-TOKEN-SUMMARY.md.

## THREADING: Consumed By (Verified)

| Consumer | Location | How It Uses This File |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-REGISTRY.md | `docs-spa/app/showcase/knowledge-architecture/` | Lists CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE.md as the authority for "Component specs" (line 135) and as a T1 synthesis file (line 28) |
| R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md | `docs-spa/app/showcase/research/` | References this file as a source (line 711) for combination theory research — character interactions inform component combination rules |
| PIPELINE-BACKBONE.md | `docs-spa/app/showcase/knowledge-architecture/` | 4 references — positions this file in the T1 synthesis pipeline stage |
| KA-DECISIONS.md | `docs-spa/app/showcase/knowledge-architecture/` | 3 references — architecture decisions about character authority |
| COMPONENTS-REGISTRY.md | `docs-spa/app/showcase/checkpoints/` | References character data for component tracking |
| 01-reachability-report.md | `docs-spa/app/showcase/dependency-trace/` | 6 references — traces this file's reachability in the dependency graph |
| design-extraction-threading.md | `docs-spa/app/showcase/dependency-trace/02-threading-data/` | 4 references — threading data for this file's position |
| OVERVIEW.md | `docs-spa/app/showcase/DESIGN-SYSTEM/components/` | References character names in the component overview table (column: "Character") |
| MASTER-INDEX.md | `design-extraction/component-system/perceptual-audit-v2/` | Navigation index entry for this file |
| FOLDER-MAP.md | `design-extraction/` | 2 references — maps this file's location and provides direct navigation |
| React components (7 files) | `docs-spa/components/content/` | PathOfTask.tsx, FileStructure.tsx, DesignDecision.tsx, CodeBlock.tsx, GotchaBox.tsx, CoreAbstraction.tsx, EssenceBox.tsx — these implement characters defined here (character names referenced in component styling/behavior) |

**Total verified consumers:** 27 files across 52 occurrences.

## THREADING: Must Honor (Upstream Constraints)

| Constraint | Source | Implication for This File |
|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| 5 Soul Pieces are final | `synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md` | All 12 characters MUST serve the 5 soul pieces — no character may contradict editorial restraint, typography primacy, confident precision, content authority, or intentional whitespace |
| Token values are locked | `synthesis/DESIGN-TOKEN-SUMMARY.md` | Characters define personality, NOT token overrides — no character may imply a token value that contradicts the locked :root block |
| border-radius MUST be 0 | `synthesis/PRODUCTION-RULES.md` | "Sharp edges as confidence markers" in master character is ALIGNED — no character may suggest rounded corners |
| box-shadow MUST be none | `synthesis/PRODUCTION-RULES.md` | Flat design philosophy embedded in master character — no character may suggest elevation or shadow |
| Anti-patterns are locked | `synthesis/ANTI-PATTERNS-REGISTRY.md` | Characters must embody the OPPOSITE of anti-patterns (e.g., no character may suggest "decoration over content") |
| NAMED-CHARACTERS.md is tracking sheet | `perceptual-audit-v2/tracking/` | This synthesis file is the AUTHORITATIVE version; NAMED-CHARACTERS.md is the working tracker — if they diverge, this file wins |

## THREADING: What Breaks If This File Is Wrong

| Breakage Scenario | Affected Files | Severity |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Character name change | 27 files / 52 occurrences across design-extraction and docs-spa | CRITICAL — inbound references use exact character names |
| Soul score change | COMPONENTS-REGISTRY.md, OVERVIEW.md, R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md | HIGH — scores inform combination confidence and component ranking |
| Character quality overlap | All downstream component implementations | HIGH — uniqueness matrix ensures no two components feel the same; overlap causes identity confusion |
| Master character redefinition | Every component character inherits from "The Unhurried Editor" | CRITICAL — master character is the personality root; changing it cascades to all 11 children |
| Structural profile error | React components in docs-spa/components/content/ | MEDIUM — zone structures inform component architecture decisions |
| Family coherence failure | Design system integrity | HIGH — if characters contradict each other, the system loses coherent voice |

## THREADING: Downstream Obligations

Any file that consumes CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE.md MUST:

| Obligation | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Use exact character names (e.g., "The Precise Transcriptionist", not "Code Block Character") | Character names are identity anchors used across 27+ files |
| Respect soul score ranking (Essence + Reasoning at top, Decision Matrix at bottom) | Scores reflect depth of soul alignment — higher-scored components get more soul latitude |
| Maintain uniqueness — no two component implementations may express the same core quality | The uniqueness matrix (Section: CHARACTER UNIQUENESS MATRIX) is a verified constraint |
| Treat master character as personality root, not peer | "The Unhurried Editor" is NOT a component — it is the system-level voice that all components inherit from |
| Preserve callout family DNA | Info, Tip, Gotcha, Challenge share 2-zone + left accent structure — diverging breaks family recognition |
| Honor Essence Callout's typography exception | Instrument Serif italic for Essence body is the ONLY serif-body exception in the system |
| Honor Core Abstraction's composite nature | Core Abstraction = Essence Callout + Code Snippet DNA — it inherits constraints from both parents |

## THREADING: Research Debt & Open Questions

| Item | Type | Detail |
|------|------|--------|
| OVERVIEW.md consumer gap | Weak reference | OVERVIEW.md references character names in a table column but does NOT cite CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE.md by filename — this is a provenance gap (the data comes from here but the link is implicit) |
| Score normalization | Open question | Soul scores range 48.5-54/60 (81-90%) — is the 9-point spread meaningful, or does the narrow range suggest the scoring rubric lacks discrimination? No analysis exists of what separates a 48.5 from a 54 |
| Character interaction rules | Research debt | R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md (line 711) references this file but the actual interaction rules between characters when components are composed on a page are not formalized here |
| Density contribution validation | Open question | Density values (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) are assigned per character but no page-level validation confirms these contribute to the intended reading rhythm |
| Visual metaphor utility | Open question | 11 visual metaphors are documented but no downstream file references them — are they actionable or decorative? |
| Callout family boundary | Ambiguity | Essence Callout is listed as part of the callout family (shared DNA) but has a UNIQUE 3-zone structure and serif italic exception — at what point does it warrant separation from the family? |

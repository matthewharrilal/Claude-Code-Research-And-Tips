## Summary Document

**Named Character:** The Spirited Catalyst
**Soul Alignment Score:** 52/60 (86%)
**Status:** APPROVED

---

## Master Perceptual Truth

"Challenge Callout feels like a friendly mentor tapping your shoulder with an interesting exercise—noticeable but not interruptive, actionable but not urgent. The purple accent invites exploration while the italic serif title leans forward with enthusiasm, not demand."

---

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...editorial sidebar that respects your time while inviting deliberate engagement..."
2. **Spacing:** "...generous enough to command attention, tight enough to feel purposeful..."
3. **Container:** "...sticky note placed in the margin of a technical book..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...friendly mentor tapping your shoulder—purple says 'pay attention' without alarm..."
5. **Composition:** "...safe exploration zone—inviting action without urgency..."
6. **Color:** "...professor's margin note saying 'try this yourself'..."
7. **Layout:** "...friendly sticky note—distinct enough to catch attention, not so loud it disrupts..."

## Character Guidance

**The Spirited Catalyst** triggers action and activates experimentation. Unlike warnings that protect or tips that advise, the Catalyst invites hands-on discovery.

**Design Mantras:**
- "Let's try something interesting."
- "Here's an opportunity to explore."
- "Build this yourself and see what happens."

**Anti-pattern:** Pushy salespeople, gamified urgency, demanding commands.

## KortAI Alignment

**Level:** STRONG (86% — 52/60)

**Aligned:** Serif italic titles, warm purple tint, left accent bar, flat design, size-based hierarchy
**Key Differentiation:** Purple distinguishes from red (warning) callouts—invites rather than cautions

---

## Critical Blindspots

1. **No responsive breakpoints** — Mobile layout broken
2. **Focus states missing** — Keyboard navigation incomplete
3. **No dark mode support** — Eye strain in low-light

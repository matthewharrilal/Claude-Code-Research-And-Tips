# Gotcha Callout Soul Extraction
## Summary Document

**Named Character:** The Vigilant Sentinel
**Soul Alignment Score:** 51/60 (85%)
**Status:** APPROVED

---

## Master Perceptual Truth

"Gotcha Callout functions as a velocity gate rather than a warning box — it briefly interrupts reading momentum, injects critical information, and releases the reader back to their original flow. The red border is a speed bump, not a stop sign."

## 7 Zone Perceptual Truths

1. **Typography:** "...feels like an editor's margin warning in a premium publication — the italic uppercase label says 'pay attention' with urgency but not panic..."
2. **Spacing:** "...creates ambient pause without alarm — pink background expands perceived space while accent bar connects to content..."
3. **Container:** "...feels like a red-flagged margin annotation where the editor circled 'THIS WILL BREAK' with a firm but composed hand..."
4. **Hierarchy:** "...the red bar activates the warning schema before conscious reading begins — urgency decreases as eye moves through..."
5. **Composition:** "...restful-alert energy — warning urgency tempered by reading calm..."
6. **Color:** "...achieves the soul of a senior editor's red pencil mark in the margin — a single, confident accent that says 'stop and read this'..."
7. **Layout:** "...the 4px red border acts as an attention anchor similar to a sticky note flag in a physical book..."

## Character Guidance

**The Vigilant Sentinel** watches at thresholds, intercepts disaster before it happens. Alert but measured; protective urgency tempered by calm expertise.

**Design Mantras:**
- "This cannot be undone."
- "What you don't see is..."
- "Many have fallen here."

**Anti-pattern:** Screaming alerts, panic inducing visuals.

## KortAI Alignment

**Level:** STRONG (85% — 26/30)

**Aligned:** Uses KortAI's primary accent-red (#E83025), left border treatment, flat design, typography restraint
**Key Strength:** Perfect semantic use of red — exactly what KortAI reserves it for

---

## Critical Blindspots

1. **Label contrast fails WCAG AA** — ~3.8:1 (needs 4.5:1)
2. **Long code overflow on mobile** — No word-break
3. **No focus styles** — Keyboard nav broken

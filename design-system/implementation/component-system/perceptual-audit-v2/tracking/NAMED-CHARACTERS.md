1. WHY THIS EXISTS

This file is the canonical registry of all named component characters in
the KORTAI design system. It defines the master character ("The Unhurried
Editor") and 11 component-level characters, each with soul score, soul
role, archetype, mantras, structural role, zone structure, density
contribution, and axis behavior. It was populated from the 7 full
NAMED-CHARACTER-DERIVATION.md sub-agent analyses and 4 minimal component
character definitions. The file enforces a UNIQUENESS rule: all characters
must be non-conflicting with distinct qualities, verified via the
Character Uniqueness Matrix and Family Coherence Check at the bottom of
the file.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS

"What is the named character, structural role, and personality archetype
for each of the 11 KORTAI components, and how do they relate to each
other as a coherent family under the Unhurried Editor master character?"

3. STATUS

ACTIVE (locked data). All 11 components populated with characters,
structural roles, and Phase 4-EPSILON family coherence verified at 5/5.
Created during Phase 4 perceptual audit. This file is complete -- no
further characters expected unless new components are added to KORTAI.

6. MUST HONOR

| # | Constraint | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | All 12 characters (1 master + 11 components) must have unique, non-overlapping qualities | Uniqueness Matrix at line ~219 is the verification gate; duplicating qualities breaks character identity |
| 2 | Values in this file were consolidated into T1 synthesis (CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE.md) | Do not modify without checking synthesis files for downstream impact |
| 3 | Family coherence score must remain 5/5 | All characters serve under the Unhurried Editor's editorial philosophy; any new character must pass the 4-criterion coherence check |
| 4 | Structural roles are Phase 4 additions and are authoritative | Zone structure, density, axis behavior data feeds token and production rule files |
| 5 | Callout family DNA relationships are explicit | Tip/Gotcha/Challenge = "IDENTICAL to Info"; Essence = "UNIQUE exception" with serif italic body |

8. CONSUMED BY

| Consumer | How It Uses This File |
|----------|----------------------|
| synthesis/CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE.md (T1) | Consolidates all named characters, archetypes, mantras, and structural roles into the authoritative character family specification |
| synthesis/MASTER-SOUL-SYNTHESIS.md (T1) | References character names when describing the 5 soul pieces |
| synthesis/PRODUCTION-RULES.md (T1) | Uses structural role definitions to enforce implementation constraints |

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

Q1: Does the Character Uniqueness Matrix contain exactly 12 rows (1 master + 11 components) with no duplicate "Core Quality" values? (Expected: YES)

Q2: For each of the 5 callout components, does the "Zone Structure" field correctly identify family DNA relationships -- specifically, are Tip/Gotcha/Challenge marked "IDENTICAL to Info" and Essence marked with "UNIQUE" serif italic body? (Expected: YES)

Q3: Does the sum of all soul scores divided by 11 match the documented average, and do individual scores here match those in PERCEPTUAL-TRUTHS.md? (Expected: YES -- cross-registry consistency)

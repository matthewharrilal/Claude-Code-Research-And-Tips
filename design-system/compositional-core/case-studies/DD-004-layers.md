## 1. NOT A TEMPLATE Warning

**⚠️ THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE — IT IS A CASE STUDY**

This document shows what ONE metaphor produced for ONE specific content tension. Pattern-matching to this output defeats the purpose of tension-derived composition.

**Why this warning exists:**

When you see geological stratification with 5 named layers (Atmosphere/Surface/Topsoil/Subsoil/Bedrock) and specific density gradients (80px sparse → 40px → 32px → 20px → 16px dense), your working memory treats it as a TEMPLATE to adapt, not a PROOF to study.

This is pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.

**Your assignment:** Extract the PROCESS (how tension → metaphor → layered depth), not the ANSWER (geological → 5 strata → 80px/40px/32px/20px/16px → expert skips middle layers).

**The trap:** "My content has skill levels too, so I'll use geological layers with Atmosphere/Surface/Topsoil/Subsoil/Bedrock."

**The correct path:** "My content serves multiple audience depths. Phase 1-2 tension derivation will reveal MY metaphor. It might converge to geological (genuine independent discovery) or diverge to ocean depth zones, atmospheric pressure layers, difficulty tiers, or continuous gradients. Layer count (3, 5, 7, continuous) and names will emerge from MY content, not copied from DD-004. I won't know until after Phase 3."

## 2. Purpose of This Case Study

**What this case study proves:** Information density CAN be stratified into distinct visual layers like geological strata, and DIFFERENT reading paths (expert vs novice) can navigate DIFFERENT layer combinations within THE SAME content structure.

**What tension type it addresses:** Content serving audiences with RADICALLY different depth needs simultaneously — where experts want headline + code (skip explanation), novices want headline + context + explanation + code, and mid-level readers want custom combinations. Opposition exists not in content TYPES but in audience NEEDS.

**What mechanism it demonstrates:**
- Spacing compression gradient (Mechanism #4): 80px → 16px as depth increases
- Zone background differentiation (Mechanism #7): 5-color progression (atmosphere → bedrock)
- Border-weight gradient (Mechanism #1): 4px primary (surface/bedrock), 4px border (topsoil), 4px secondary (subsoil)
- Typographic scale jumping (Mechanism #11): 36px → 22px → 14px → 13px
- Progressive disclosure (Mechanism #12): Atmosphere → Surface → Topsoil → Subsoil → Bedrock
- 2-zone component DNA at layer level (Mechanism #2): Layer indicator + layer content
- Code block dark background (Mechanism #17): Bedrock = #1A1A1A
- Data table compact structure (Mechanism #18): Subsoil detail lists

## 3. Tension That Produced This

**Content Analyzed:**

**Content:** OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow — technical API documentation
**Subject:** Implementing secure authentication for server-side applications
**Challenge:** SAME content must serve 3 audiences: Experts (want code fast), Novices (need full context + explanation), Mid-level (selective depth)

### Phase 1 — Multi-Axis Questioning (Actual Questions)

**Audience Depth Axis:**
- Q: Does content serve readers with different expertise levels simultaneously?
- A: YES — Experts know OAuth already (want implementation), novices need concept explanation first
- Q: Can content support SELECTIVE depth consumption (not linear)?
- A: YES — Experts can jump Surface → Bedrock (skip middle layers), novices can read all layers

**Information Density Gradient Axis:**
- Q: Does content have natural progression from overview → detail → implementation?
- A: YES — Breadcrumb context (sparse) → headline (sparse) → key points (medium) → steps (dense) → code (maximum)
- Q: Does density INCREASE as depth increases?
- A: YES — Deeper layers = more packed information (spacing compresses, content densifies)

**Reading Path Variation Axis:**
- Q: Do different readers need different PATHS through same content?
- A: YES — Expert path: Surface + Bedrock only. Novice path: Atmosphere + Surface + Topsoil + Subsoil + Bedrock (full stack)
- Q: Can single structure support multiple paths WITHOUT duplication?
- A: YES — If layers are OPTIONAL (not required sequentially), readers choose depth

### Phase 2 — Tension Derivation (Actual Table)

| Side A | Opposition | Side B | Overlap | Width Score |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Expert readers (skip context, want code) | ←→ | Novice readers (need full explanation) | Both want OAuth implementation guidance | 9/10 |
| Sparse overview (headlines, breadcrumbs) | ←→ | Dense reference (code, detailed steps) | Both necessary for comprehensive docs | 8/10 |
| Selective depth (jump to relevant layer) | ←→ | Full stack (read all layers) | Readers want control over depth | 9/10 |
| Single unified content | ←→ | Multiple audience-specific versions | Maintenance burden vs audience fit | 10/10 |

**Richness Score:** 36/40 → 90% → Track 2 HIGH (strong tension, creative metaphor warranted)

**Note:** This scored HIGHEST richness among geological-pattern explorations, explaining why DD-004 scored 35/40 (tied for second) despite being longer and more complex than other DD files.

### What Axes Were Explored

**Explored:**
1. **Audience Depth Spectrum** (PRODUCTIVE — led to layered structure)
2. **Density Gradient** (PRODUCTIVE — led to spacing compression + background progression)
3. **Reading Path Variation** (PRODUCTIVE — led to expert/novice path examples)
4. **Content Duplication vs Unification** (PRODUCTIVE — led to single structure serving multiple audiences)
5. **Hierarchical vs Flat** (REJECTED — content has clear depth hierarchy, not flat)
6. **Simple vs Complex** (REJECTED — content is uniformly complex, audience expertise varies not content)

### What Candidates Were Considered and Rejected

**Metaphor Candidates Considered:**

1. **Ocean Depth Zones** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Ocean has surface → photic zone → twilight zone → abyss (depth progression)
   - Why rejected: Ocean depth is CONTINUOUS (no discrete boundaries). Documentation needs DISCRETE layers for visual distinction.
   - Content mismatch: OAuth docs have clear sections (overview, steps, code) — discrete not continuous

2. **Building Floors** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Buildings have basement → ground floor → upper floors (vertical progression)
   - Why rejected: Building floors are ASCENDING (up = progress). Documentation depth is DESCENDING (down = detail).
   - Perceptual mismatch: Users expect "deeper" = more detail, not "higher" = more detail

3. **Geological Strata** (SELECTED)
   - Why tried: Earth's layers (atmosphere → surface → topsoil → subsoil → bedrock) encode DEPTH + TIME + STABILITY
   - Why it worked:
     - DEPTH: Deeper = more fundamental/detailed (matches documentation depth metaphor)
     - TIME: Older strata = more established knowledge (matches confidence encoding)
     - STABILITY: Bedrock = unchanging reference (matches code as stable foundation)
     - DISCRETE LAYERS: Clear visual boundaries between strata (matches content section divisions)
   - Research grounding: R-3 Geological Model (Insight #5), widest research base (6 R3 findings)

## 4. The Search in Action

### The Metaphor Discovery Moment

**The insight:** Content doesn't just have "beginner vs advanced" — it has DEPTH LAYERS where each layer serves a different reading mode. Experts DRILL DOWN to bedrock (skip topsoil). Novices START AT SURFACE and dig progressively. Mid-level readers take selective layers.

**Why this metaphor resonated:** Geological strata aren't just "stacked boxes" — they encode THREE DIMENSIONS simultaneously:
1. **DEPTH:** Surface (0m) → Bedrock (kilometers deep)
2. **TIME:** Recent sediment (topsoil, dynamic) → Ancient bedrock (stable, unchanging)
3. **DENSITY:** Loose topsoil (aerated) → Compressed bedrock (solid)

Mapping to documentation:
- **DEPTH = Content Detail:** Overview (surface) → Implementation steps (subsoil) → Raw code (bedrock)
- **TIME = Knowledge Stability:** Emerging practices (topsoil) → Established patterns (bedrock)
- **DENSITY = Information Packing:** Sparse headlines (surface) → Dense code blocks (bedrock)

### What Made This Metaphor Resonate with the Tensions

**Tension 1 (Expert vs Novice):**
- Metaphor resolution: Experts DRILL STRAIGHT TO BEDROCK (skip middle strata). Novices DIG PROGRESSIVELY (through all layers).
- Why it works: Geological drilling metaphor is FAMILIAR (oil drilling, core samples) + FLEXIBLE (you can drill to any depth)

**Tension 2 (Sparse vs Dense):**
- Metaphor resolution: Geological density INCREASES WITH DEPTH (topsoil is loose, bedrock is compressed)
- Why it works: Natural law (pressure compresses deeper layers) maps to documentation pattern (detail compresses space)

**Tension 3 (Selective vs Full Stack):**
- Metaphor resolution: Geologists take CORE SAMPLES at selected depths. Readers select layers.
- Why it works: Selective depth is VALID EXPLORATION, not skipping/cheating

**Tension 4 (Single Structure vs Multiple Versions):**
- Metaphor resolution: ONE geological formation serves multiple research questions (surface ecology, mineral composition, seismic stability)
- Why it works: Same strata, different extraction paths (surface ecologist vs geophysicist vs miner)

### The Moment of Collapse

**The collapse moment:** Realizing that if documentation presents SEQUENTIAL SECTIONS (Intro → Overview → Steps → Code), experts must SCROLL PAST unwanted sections. But if documentation presents DEPTH LAYERS with visual encoding, experts can VISUALLY SKIP (bedrock is dark, has "Bedrock Layer" indicator — obvious destination).

**Before collapse:** Four separate design decisions:
1. How to structure intro/context (sparse layout)
2. How to structure overview/key-points (medium density)
3. How to structure detailed steps (higher density)
4. How to structure code reference (maximum density)

**After collapse:** ONE geological metaphor resolves all four:
- Atmosphere = ambient context (breadcrumbs, framing prose)
- Surface = headlines (primary CTA, subtitle)
- Topsoil = key points (scannable summaries, info callouts)
- Subsoil = detailed steps (numbered procedures, tips, gotchas, file trees)
- Bedrock = code (dark background, maximum density, copy buttons)

The metaphor doesn't generate five separate structures — it generates ONE DEPTH GRADIENT with five discrete zones.

### How the Metaphor Dictated Structure

**The metaphor DICTATED:**

1. **5-layer structure** (Atmosphere/Surface/Topsoil/Subsoil/Bedrock)
   - Metaphor demanded: Geological earth has discrete strata (not 3, not 7, but 5 major zones from atmosphere to core)
   - Not negotiable: Fewer layers = insufficient depth options. More layers = over-granular.
   - Why 5 specifically: Atmosphere (context), Surface (headline), Topsoil (overview), Subsoil (detail), Bedrock (code) = natural information hierarchy in technical docs

2. **Background color progression** (light → dark)
   - Metaphor demanded: Deeper strata are darker (less light penetrates)
   - Not negotiable: Reversing to dark → light contradicts geological metaphor
   - Color encoding: #FEF9F5 (atmosphere) → #FFFFFF (surface) → #F7F4F0 (topsoil) → #F0EBE3 (subsoil) → #1A1A1A (bedrock)

3. **Spacing compression** (80px → 40px → 32px → 20px → 16px)
   - Metaphor demanded: Geological pressure compresses deeper layers (less space between particles)
   - Not negotiable: Increasing spacing with depth contradicts compression metaphor
   - Perceptual encoding: Sparse atmosphere (breathing room) → Dense bedrock (packed tight)

4. **Layer indicators** (visual depth markers showing current layer)
   - Metaphor demanded: Geologists mark core sample depths. Readers need depth awareness.
   - Not negotiable: Unlabeled layers = confusion about current depth
   - Visual encoding: 5-bar indicator showing 1-5 active bars depending on layer depth

5. **Expert vs Novice paths** (Surface+Bedrock vs Full Stack)
   - Metaphor demanded: Different drilling objectives (oil well = deep only, agricultural survey = topsoil focus)
   - Not negotiable: Single linear path forces experts through unwanted layers
   - Content structure: Example 1 shows full 5-layer stack, Example 2 shows Surface→Bedrock (expert shortcut), Example 3 shows full explanatory stack (novice path)

### Where Mechanisms Were Applied

**Mechanisms applied from catalog:**

1. **Spacing Compression Gradient** (Mechanism #4)
   - Applied: `--space-20: 80px` (atmosphere) → `--space-10: 40px` (surface) → `--space-8: 32px` (topsoil) → `--space-5: 20px` (subsoil) → `--space-4: 16px` (bedrock)
   - Why here: Geological compression (pressure increases with depth) maps to spacing reduction

2. **Zone Background Differentiation** (Mechanism #7)
   - Applied: 5-color progression using layer-specific CSS custom properties
   - Why here: Visual distinction between strata requires background variation

3. **Border-Weight Gradient** (Mechanism #1)
   - Applied: 4px primary red (surface, bedrock = important), 4px border-color (topsoil = medium), 4px text-secondary (subsoil = detail)
   - Why here: Border weight signals layer importance/stability (surface + bedrock = structural, middle layers = transitional)

4. **Typographic Scale Jumping** (Mechanism #11)
   - Applied: 36px (surface title) → 22px (topsoil section title) → 14px (subsoil title) → 12px (bedrock filename)
   - Why here: Type size reduction mirrors depth progression

5. **Progressive Disclosure** (Mechanism #12)
   - Applied: Content reveals in order: Atmosphere → Surface → Topsoil → Subsoil → Bedrock
   - Why here: Geological metaphor demands top-to-bottom revelation (can't show bedrock before topsoil in linear scroll)

6. **2-Zone Component DNA** (Mechanism #2)
   - Applied: Each layer has indicator label zone (`.layer-indicator`) + content zone (layer-specific content)
   - Why here: Layers need internal structure (meta-label + actual content)

7. **Code Block Dark Background** (Mechanism #17)
   - Applied: Bedrock layer uses `background: var(--layer-bedrock)` = `#1A1A1A`
   - Why here: Bedrock = deep/dark/stable in geological metaphor

8. **Subsoil Detail Lists** (Mechanism #18 adapted)
   - Applied: `.subsoil-details` uses 2-column grid for key-value pairs
   - Why here: Subsoil = detailed procedural steps, structured as compact lists

## 5. What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)

### ☑ REUSABLE MECHANISMS (Apply to YOUR metaphor)

☑ **Spacing Compression Gradient** — Works for ANY depth/hierarchy/density encoding
   - What it is: Progressive padding reduction (80px → 40px → 32px → 20px → 16px) as you move through structure
   - Why reusable: Compression = "more packed" universally (works for depth, detail, importance)
   - How to adapt: Define YOUR compression axis (depth, complexity, priority) and map to spacing scale (not necessarily 80→16)

☑ **Zone Background Differentiation** — Works for ANY layer/state/category encoding
   - What it is: 5-color progression (light → dark) distinguishes zones
   - Why reusable: Color differentiation aids navigation regardless of semantic meaning
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR zones to background palette (might be warm→cool, muted→vibrant, not light→dark)

☑ **Border-Weight Gradient** — Works for ANY hierarchy/importance encoding
   - What it is: Use border thickness to signal structural vs transitional zones
   - Why reusable: Visual weight = importance is perceptual universal
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR importance hierarchy to border-weight (4px/3px/2px/1px or custom scale)

☑ **Layer Indicators** — Works for ANY multi-section navigation
   - What it is: Visual marker showing current depth/position (5-bar indicator, 1-5 active)
   - Why reusable: Position awareness aids navigation in deep structures
   - How to adapt: Use YOUR depth count (3-bar, 7-bar, continuous progress bar) and visual style

☑ **Multiple Reading Paths** — Works for ANY multi-audience content
   - What it is: Structure supports BOTH full sequential reading AND selective depth jumping
   - Why reusable: Expert/novice divide exists across many content types
   - How to adapt: Identify YOUR audience paths and ensure structure supports all (not just linear)

☑ **Progressive Disclosure** (Mechanism #12)
   - Applied: Content reveals in depth order (shallow → deep)
   - Why reusable: Works for tutorials, onboarding, complexity gradients
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR progression axis to revelation order

### ✗ NOT REUSABLE (Metaphor-Specific)

✗ **Geological vocabulary** ("Atmosphere", "Surface", "Topsoil", "Subsoil", "Bedrock")
   - Why not reusable: Only makes sense within geological metaphor
   - The decision: Labels reinforce earth-science metaphor coherence (metaphor-dependent)
   - YOUR metaphor: Ocean zones (Sunlit/Twilight/Midnight/Abyss), Building floors (Lobby/Floor2/Floor5/Penthouse), Difficulty tiers (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert)

✗ **5-layer structure** (specific layer count)
   - Why not reusable: YOUR content may need 3 layers, 7 layers, or continuous gradient
   - The decision: 5 strata match earth's major zones + documentation's natural sections (contingent)
   - YOUR metaphor: Might use 3 tiers (Overview/Detail/Reference), 6 zones (progressive complexity), or smooth gradient

✗ **Specific spacing values** (80px/40px/32px/20px/16px)
   - Why not reusable: Derived from THIS content's viewport + perceptual compression testing
   - The decision: 80px atmosphere felt spacious, 16px bedrock felt dense at 1440px viewport
   - YOUR metaphor: Will derive spacing from YOUR content density needs + perceptual testing

✗ **Light-to-dark progression** (warm cream → deep black)
   - Why not reusable: Light→dark encodes "depth" in geological metaphor; YOUR metaphor might reverse or use hue
   - The decision: Darkness = depth is geological convention (less sunlight penetrates)
   - YOUR metaphor: Ocean depth might darken (same), building floors might lighten (up = more light), difficulty might shift hue (blue→red)

✗ **Bedrock = Code** (code at deepest layer)
   - Why not reusable: Bedrock = stable/unchanging/foundational maps to CODE in API docs; YOUR content might put code elsewhere
   - The decision: OAuth code is reference truth (bedrock-like stability)
   - YOUR metaphor: Tutorials might put code at SURFACE (start coding fast), conceptual docs might omit code entirely

✗ **Expert path = Surface+Bedrock** (skip middle layers)
   - Why not reusable: Expert shortcut is content-specific (API docs: headline+code suffices)
   - The decision: Experts know OAuth context already, want implementation only
   - YOUR metaphor: Expert path might be Surface+Topsoil (skip deep detail), or Surface only (overview suffices), or Bedrock only (code first)

## 6. Your Divergence Assignment

### Divergence Verification Table

| Comparison Dimension | DD-004 Geological | Your Metaphor | Convergence? | Justification Required |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Core Metaphor** | Geological stratification (earth's layers) | [Your metaphor] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Spatial Encoding** | Vertical depth (atmosphere → bedrock) with 5 discrete strata | [Your encoding] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Primary Tension** | Expert (skip context) vs Novice (need full explanation) serving SAME content | [Your tensions] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Structural Pattern** | 5 named layers with spacing compression (80px → 16px) + background darkening | [Your structure] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Visual Treatment** | Light cream → dark black progression + layer indicators + expert/novice path examples | [Your treatment] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |

### If Convergence Detected (Any "Similar" boxes checked)

**You MUST provide STRONG evidence of independent derivation:**

#### Evidence of Independent Convergence

**Requirement:** Show your Phase 1-2 work proving you derived this metaphor independently.

1. **Phase 1 Multi-Axis Questions:**
   [Paste your actual questions — must be content-specific, not copied from this case study]
   - Did you independently discover audience depth tension (expert vs novice SAME content)?
   - Did you independently identify selective depth vs full stack tension?

2. **Phase 2 Tension Table:**
   [Paste your actual tension derivation — must show genuine opposition + overlap analysis]
   - Does your tension table show independent discovery of depth gradient + audience variation?
   - Does your richness score independently justify creative metaphor search?

3. **Phase 3 Search Query:**
   [Paste your query — must be constructed from YOUR tensions, not adapted from this case study]
   - Did "geological" or "layers" emerge from YOUR query, or did you pattern-match from DD-004?

4. **Convergence Explanation:**
   [Explain WHY your independent process led to same metaphor]

   **Example valid convergence:**
   > "My content ALSO has 3-audience depth needs (beginners need concept explanation, intermediate need implementation steps, experts need code reference only). Geological metaphor emerged independently because DEPTH + SELECTIVE DRILLING matches multi-level API documentation. Convergence is genuine — two similar content structures (OAuth docs, Payment API docs) with identical audience tensions led to geological stratification."

   **Example INVALID convergence (pattern-matching):**
   > "My content has sections, so I'll use geological layers with Atmosphere/Surface/Topsoil/Subsoil/Bedrock."
   > ← This is pattern-matching. Sections exist in ALL documentation. That's not sufficient tension for geological metaphor.

#### If You Cannot Provide Strong Evidence

**STOP. You pattern-matched.**

Re-run Phase 3 with explicit constraint: **"Geological layers metaphor is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"**

**Alternative metaphors to explore:**
- **Ocean Depth Zones** (Sunlit → Photic → Twilight → Midnight → Abyss) — aquatic not terrestrial, continuous depth not discrete strata
- **Building Floors** (Basement → Ground → Upper Floors → Penthouse) — ascending height not descending depth
- **Difficulty Tiers** (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert) — skill-based not depth-based
- **Atmospheric Pressure Zones** (Troposphere → Stratosphere → Mesosphere → Thermosphere) — altitude-based layers
- **Tree Root System** (Canopy → Trunk → Topsoil Roots → Deep Roots → Taproot) — organic depth metaphor
- [Generate 3 more alternatives specific to YOUR content]

If you explore alternatives and STILL converge to geological after genuine search, document the alternatives you rejected and why geological was stronger.

### If Divergence Confirmed (All "Different" boxes checked)

**You successfully diverged. Extract the mechanisms, ignore the layout.**

#### Successful Divergence — What to Do Next

1. **Extract applicable mechanisms** (Section 5 — Reusable list)
   - Review ☑ mechanisms (Spacing Compression, Zone Background, Border-Weight, Layer Indicators, Multiple Paths)
   - Select 2-4 most relevant to YOUR metaphor
   - Ignore metaphor-specific decisions (✗ items like "geological vocabulary", "5 layers", "light-to-dark progression")

2. **Proceed to implementation** (Phase 4 in tension-composition skill)
   - Use mechanisms catalog as toolbox
   - Build YOUR metaphor, not this one
   - Your layer count, spacing values, color progression, vocabulary will differ

3. **Contribute to library growth**
   - Your metaphor will become a NEW case study
   - Library enriches (more proof points), doesn't repeat

### Regeneration Path (If Pattern-Matching Detected)

**If you realized you pattern-matched AFTER reading this case study:**

1. **Acknowledge it** — Pattern-matching isn't "wrong," but it's NOT creative derivation
2. **Decide:**
   - **Option A:** Accept pattern-match, document as "Adapted from DD-004 geological case study"
     - Acceptable for low-risk content where creative novelty isn't required
     - Must still apply mechanisms correctly (not copy CSS values blindly)
   - **Option B:** Regenerate with constraint ("geological is taken, what ELSE works?")
     - Required for high-value content, design system contributions, or published work
3. **If regenerating:**
   - Return to Phase 2 tension table
   - Add constraint: "Geological stratification metaphor is off-limits"
   - Re-run Phase 3 search with constraint active
   - Generate 3+ alternative metaphors (Ocean Zones, Building Floors, Difficulty Tiers, Atmospheric Pressure, Tree Roots)
   - Select best alternative based on tension fit (NOT similarity to geological)
   - Commit to alternative BEFORE re-reading library

**Verification that regeneration worked:**
- Can you describe your metaphor WITHOUT using words "layer", "strata", "geological", "depth", "bedrock"?
- Does your metaphor have vocabulary unique to it (not borrowed from DD-004)?
- If someone reads both case studies side-by-side, would they see DIVERGENT solutions, not VARIANTS?

---

**Key Insight from DD-004:**

**Geological scored 35/40 (tied for second-highest DD)** with widest research base (6 R3 findings, 3 EXEMPLARY). This pattern excels at serving MULTIPLE AUDIENCES with DIFFERENT DEPTH NEEDS in SINGLE CONTENT STRUCTURE. Not optimal for single-audience content, linear tutorials, or flat reference docs.

Geological = proven pattern for multi-level API docs, technical specifications with concept+implementation, educational content serving beginner+expert simultaneously.

**Longest file (1,099 lines)** reflects complexity cost — geological stratification requires MORE structure than simpler patterns (islands, fractal, pulse). Use when audience diversity JUSTIFIES structural investment.

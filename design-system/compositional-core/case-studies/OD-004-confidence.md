# OD-004: Confidence-Based Structure — Case Study

**⚠️ THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE — IT IS A CASE STUDY**

This document shows what ONE metaphor produced for ONE specific content. Pattern-matching to this output defeats the purpose.

**Why this warning exists:**

When you see a worked example — geological strata with 4 layers, certainty labels, border-weight gradient encoding confidence — your working memory treats it as a TEMPLATE to adapt, not a PROOF to study.

This is pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.

**Your assignment:** Extract the PROCESS (how tension → metaphor → layout), not the ANSWER (geological → 4 strata → these border widths).

**The trap:** "My content has certainty levels too, so I'll use geological stratification."

**The correct path:** "My content has certainty levels. Phase 1-2 tension derivation will reveal MY metaphor. It might converge to geological (genuine independent discovery) or diverge completely. I won't know until after Phase 3."

## Purpose of This Case Study

**What this case study proves:** Documentation organized by confidence level (established → probable → speculative → open) CAN create natural GEOLOGICAL density rhythm where certainty inversely correlates with density.

**What tension type it addresses:** Content with variable epistemic status — some claims are backed by decades of evidence (established), others are emerging patterns with limited validation (speculative), others are genuine open questions with competing hypotheses. Readers need to calibrate their trust and investment based on the strength of evidence.

**What mechanism it demonstrates:** Border-weight gradient encoding (4px/3px/2px/1px maps to high/medium/speculative/low confidence) + spacing compression (sparse for certain, dense for uncertain) + background progression (strata differentiation). The three mechanisms reinforce geological metaphor: deep bedrock is compressed and stable (certain knowledge), surface topsoil is expansive and dynamic (uncertain knowledge).

## Tension That Produced This

### Content Analyzed

**Content:** API Best Practices & Stability Guide — technical reference documentation (4,500 words)
**Subject:** API design patterns organized by confidence level (HTTP status codes = established, sliding-window rate limiting = probable, AI-assisted schema generation = speculative, governance models = open questions)
**Reader need:** Understand BOTH what to do AND how confident to be in the recommendation

### Phase 1 — Multi-Axis Questioning (Actual Questions)

**Certainty vs Uncertainty Axis:**
- Q: Does content have natural confidence gradients (some claims strong, others weak)?
- A: YES — HTTP conventions are industry-standard (100% consensus), edge-first architecture is emerging (20% adoption, contested)

**Established vs Exploratory Axis:**
- Q: Can content be stratified by evidence strength?
- A: YES — 4 natural groupings: established (50+ sources, production-proven), probable (10-20 sources, case studies), speculative (3-8 sources, early adopters), open (0-3 sources, anecdotal)

**Depth vs Surface Axis:**
- Q: Does content have vertical architecture (foundational vs experimental)?
- A: YES — established practices are foundational (bedrock all APIs build on), speculative practices are surface-level experiments (may change rapidly)

### Phase 2 — Tension Derivation (Actual Table)

| Side A | Opposition | Side B | Overlap | Width Score |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Established (sparse, compressed) | ←→ | Speculative (expansive, detailed caveats) | Both are valid API knowledge | 9/10 |
| High certainty (terse assertions) | ←→ | Low certainty (hedged explanations) | Both serve reader's decision-making | 8/10 |
| Foundational depth (bedrock) | ←→ | Exploratory surface (topsoil) | Both needed for complete picture | 7/10 |

**Richness Score:** 24/30 → 80% → Track 2 warranted

### What Axes Were Explored

**Explored:**
1. Certainty vs Uncertainty (PRODUCTIVE — led to geological strata)
2. Depth vs Surface (PRODUCTIVE — led to vertical compression)
3. Established vs Exploratory (PRODUCTIVE — led to 4-layer structure)
4. Simple vs Complex (REJECTED — complexity doesn't correlate with certainty)

### What Candidates Were Considered and Rejected

**Metaphor Candidates Considered:**

1. **Confidence Percentage** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Quantitative certainty (95% certain, 60% certain, 20% certain)
   - Why rejected: Epistemic confidence isn't measurable with false precision — categories (established/probable/speculative) are more honest than percentages

2. **Traffic Light** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Green = safe, yellow = caution, red = danger
   - Why rejected: Only 3 levels (content had 4 natural strata), and color-coding implies moral judgment (green = good, red = bad) rather than epistemic status

3. **Geological Core Sample** (SELECTED)
   - Why tried: Geological layers encode BOTH depth (surface→core) and time/stability (recent→ancient)
   - Why it worked: Earth's strata NATURALLY separate by age and consolidation. Deep bedrock = old, compressed, stable. Surface topsoil = recent, loose, dynamic. This DUAL encoding (depth + stability) matched content's dual need (organize by confidence + signal evidence strength).

## The Search in Action

### The Metaphor Discovery Moment

**The insight:** Geological stratification encodes certainty through SPATIAL POSITION (vertical depth) AND MATERIAL DENSITY (compression). Bedrock at depth is certain because it has been compressed by weight and time. Topsoil at surface is uncertain because it's recent and subject to change. The metaphor didn't just organize content by confidence — it EXPLAINED why some knowledge is stable and other knowledge is exploratory.

**Why this metaphor resonated:** Geological core samples are familiar (everyone knows surface→deep progression) yet scientifically rigorous (geologists actually read certainty from strata). The metaphor carries educational weight without being condescending.

### What Made This Metaphor Resonate with the Tensions

**Tension 1 (Established vs Speculative):**
- Metaphor resolution: Established = bedrock (deep, compressed), Speculative = topsoil (surface, expansive)
- Why it works: Geological depth NATURALLY encodes stability. Deeper = older = more consolidated = more certain. No artificial mapping required.

**Tension 2 (Sparse vs Dense):**
- Metaphor resolution: Certain knowledge is SPARSE (terse assertions, few words needed), uncertain knowledge is DENSE (many caveats, hedges, qualifiers)
- Why it works: Inverse density-confidence correlation is PERCEPTUALLY INTUITIVE. What is known needs few words. What is unknown needs many.

**Tension 3 (Foundational vs Experimental):**
- Metaphor resolution: Bedrock = foundational practices all APIs build on, Topsoil = experimental approaches that may or may not survive
- Why it works: Construction metaphor (build on bedrock, not topsoil) is universally understood

### The Moment of Collapse

**The collapse moment:** Realizing that geological depth simultaneously resolves THREE tensions:
1. Established/Speculative (depth encodes age/stability)
2. Sparse/Dense (compression gradient encodes density)
3. Foundational/Experimental (bedrock vs topsoil encodes structural role)

**Before collapse:** Three separate layout problems (organize by confidence, create density rhythm, signal structural importance)
**After collapse:** ONE spatial metaphor (vertical geological depth) resolves all three simultaneously

### How the Metaphor Dictated Structure

**The metaphor DICTATED:**

1. **4-layer structure** (Established / Probable / Speculative / Open)
   - Metaphor demanded: Strata count matches content's natural confidence groupings
   - Not negotiable: Geological layers are DISCRETE and BOUNDED (no gradual fade)

2. **Depth gradient** (padding compression: 40px → 32px → 20px → 16px)
   - Metaphor demanded: Deeper layers are MORE COMPRESSED (geological weight)
   - Not negotiable: Depth MUST be perceptually encoded via spacing reduction

3. **Border-weight encoding** (4px established → 3px probable → 2px speculative → 1px open)
   - Metaphor demanded: Visual weight corresponds to epistemic weight
   - Not negotiable: Thicker borders = stronger claims (perceptual encoding of confidence)

4. **Stratum boundary markers** (48px spacing + 3px rule + label)
   - Metaphor demanded: Clear demarcation between strata (geological boundaries are sharp)
   - Not negotiable: Fuzzy transitions would destroy the discrete-layer metaphor

5. **Geological vocabulary** ("Stratum 1", "Bedrock", "Topsoil", "Established")
   - Metaphor demanded: Labels reinforce spatial metaphor coherence
   - Not negotiable: Generic labels ("Level 1-4") would break metaphor resonance

### Where Mechanisms Were Applied

**Mechanisms applied from catalog:**

1. **Border-Weight Gradient Encoding** (Mechanism #1)
   - Applied: 4px borders on Established stratum, 3px on Probable, 2px on Speculative, 1px on Open
   - Why here: Metaphor needed confidence encoding; border-weight is the visual technique

2. **Spacing Compression** (Mechanism #4)
   - Applied: 40px padding → 32px → 20px → 16px as depth increases
   - Why here: Geological weight compresses lower layers (depth = compression)

3. **Zone Background Differentiation** (Mechanism #7)
   - Applied: Subtle background shift between strata (sparse → moderate → dense → densest)
   - Why here: Chromatic reinforcement of the geological layer boundaries

4. **Dark Header + 3px Primary Border** (Mechanism #13)
   - Applied: Header styled as "Geological Survey" with dark background and navigation minimap
   - Why here: Survey header = reader's orientation tool (like geological survey map)

## What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)

### ☑ REUSABLE MECHANISMS (Apply to YOUR metaphor)

☑ **Border-Weight Gradient Encoding** — Works for ANY hierarchy/confidence/importance/priority encoding
   - What it is: Use border thickness (4px/3px/2px/1px) to encode semantic levels
   - Why reusable: Hierarchy is universal; thickness is a visual parameter
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR hierarchy (not certainty) to border-weight scale (might be urgency, priority, importance)

☑ **Spacing Compression** — Works for ANY depth/density/intensity/progression gradient
   - What it is: Decrease padding/margin along a meaningful progression
   - Why reusable: Compression encodes "more" (depth, density, weight, intensity)
   - How to adapt: Identify YOUR gradient axis (depth, time, complexity, priority), apply compression

☑ **Zone Background Differentiation** — Works for ANY stratified/layered content
   - What it is: Subtle background color progression between layers
   - Why reusable: Chromatic differentiation reinforces structural boundaries
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR strata (not confidence) to background progression

☑ **Stratum Boundary Markers** — Works for ANY content with discrete sections requiring strong separation
   - What it is: Visual separator (spacing + rule + label) between major sections
   - Why reusable: Strong boundaries prevent cognitive bleed between sections
   - How to adapt: Use at YOUR major section boundaries (chapters, phases, categories)

☑ **Inverse Density-Confidence Correlation** — Works for ANY content where certainty varies
   - What it is: Certain claims are SPARSE (terse), uncertain claims are DENSE (caveated)
   - Why reusable: Epistemic honesty principle (what is known needs few words, what is uncertain needs many)
   - How to adapt: Apply to YOUR content's certainty gradients (might be design decisions, research findings, technical recommendations)

### ✗ NOT REUSABLE (Metaphor-Specific)

✗ **Geological vocabulary** ("Stratum", "Bedrock", "Topsoil", "Geological Survey")
   - Why not reusable: Only makes sense within geological metaphor
   - YOUR metaphor: Might use "Tier", "Foundation", "Experimental", "Priority Matrix"

✗ **4-layer structure** (Established/Probable/Speculative/Open)
   - Why not reusable: Specific to THIS content's natural confidence groupings
   - YOUR metaphor: Might have 2 layers (certain/uncertain), 3 layers (high/medium/low), or 6+ layers

✗ **Specific padding values** (40px → 32px → 20px → 16px)
   - Why not reusable: Derived from THIS content's depth needs + perceptual testing
   - YOUR metaphor: Test YOUR compression ratio (might be 48px → 24px, or 60px → 40px → 20px)

✗ **Confidence filter tabs** ("Facts Only" / "Full Analysis" / "Everything")
   - Why not reusable: Specific to API documentation where readers might want only established practices
   - YOUR metaphor: YOUR content might need different filtering (by role, by complexity, by use case)

✗ **Evidence DNA markers** ("Sources: 50+", "Validation: Production-proven")
   - Why not reusable: Specific to THIS content's evidence types (production APIs)
   - YOUR metaphor: YOUR evidence might be user research, A/B tests, expert consensus

## Your Divergence Assignment

### Divergence Verification Table

| Comparison Dimension | This Case Study | Your Metaphor | Convergence? | Justification Required |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Core Metaphor** | Geological stratification | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Spatial Encoding** | Vertical depth (surface → bedrock) | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Primary Tension** | Certainty gradient + sparse/dense inverse correlation | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |

| **Visual Treatment** | Border-weight + spacing compression + background progression | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |

### If Convergence Detected (Any "Similar" boxes checked)

**You MUST provide STRONG evidence of independent derivation:**

#### Evidence of Independent Convergence

**Requirement:** Show your Phase 1-2 work proving you derived this metaphor independently.

1. **Phase 1 Multi-Axis Questions:**
   [Paste your actual questions — must be content-specific, not copied from this case study]

2. **Phase 2 Tension Table:**
   [Paste your actual tension derivation — must show genuine opposition + overlap analysis]

3. **Phase 3 Search Query:**
   [Paste your query — must be constructed from YOUR tensions, not adapted from this case study]

4. **Convergence Explanation:**
   [Explain WHY your independent process led to same metaphor]

   Example:
   > "My content ALSO has 4-level confidence hierarchy (verified facts → research findings → hypotheses → open questions). Geological metaphor emerged independently because depth + stability are NATURAL pairings in human cognition (universal conceptual metaphor). Convergence is genuine — two different contents with similar epistemic structures led to similar spatial metaphors."

#### If You Cannot Provide Strong Evidence

**STOP. You pattern-matched.**

Re-run Phase 3 with explicit constraint: **"Geological is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"**

**Alternative metaphors to explore:**
- Oceanic depth (surface → abyss) — aquatic instead of terrestrial
- Architectural foundation (roofline → bedrock) — built environment instead of natural
- Tree root system (canopy → taproot) — organic depth encoding
- Signal strength (5 bars → 1 bar) — technological instead of natural
- [Generate 3 more alternatives specific to YOUR content]

### If Divergence Confirmed (All "Different" boxes checked)

**You successfully diverged. Extract the mechanisms, ignore the layout.**

#### Successful Divergence — What to Do Next

1. **Extract applicable mechanisms** (Section 5 — Reusable list)
   - Review ☑ mechanisms
   - Select 2-4 most relevant to YOUR metaphor
   - Ignore metaphor-specific decisions (✗ items)

2. **Proceed to implementation** (Phase 4 in tension-composition skill)
   - Use mechanisms catalog as toolbox
   - Build YOUR metaphor, not this one

3. **Contribute to library growth**
   - Your metaphor will become a NEW case study
   - Library grows (enriches), doesn't repeat

### Regeneration Path (If Pattern-Matching Detected)

**If you realized you pattern-matched AFTER reading this case study:**

1. **Acknowledge it** — Pattern-matching isn't "wrong," but it's NOT creative derivation
2. **Decide:**
   - Option A: Accept pattern-match, document as "Adapted from OD-004 geological case study"
   - Option B: Regenerate with constraint ("geological is taken, what ELSE works?")
3. **If regenerating:**
   - Return to Phase 2 tension table
   - Add constraint: "Geological metaphor is off-limits"
   - Re-run Phase 3 search with constraint active
   - Generate 3+ alternative metaphors
   - Select best alternative, commit BEFORE re-reading library

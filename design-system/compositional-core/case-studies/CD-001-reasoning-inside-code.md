**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Exploration ID:** CD-001-reasoning-inside-code.html
**Audit Score:** 38/40
**Density:** CRESCENDO (sparse → dense)
**Organization:** NARRATIVE ARC (Freytag structure)

## 1. NOT A TEMPLATE Warning

**THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE.** This case study documents what ONE specific metaphor produced for ONE specific content. Pattern-matching to this output defeats the purpose of tension-derived composition.

**Why this warning exists:**

When you see a worked example — heavy component types (Code, Reasoning, Core Abstraction) with velocity interleaving, F-Pattern transitioning to Bento Grid via BRIDGE, CRESCENDO density building to peak — your working memory treats it as a TEMPLATE to adapt, not a PROOF to study.

This is pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.

**Your assignment:** Extract the PROCESS (how heavy-component content → velocity rule → interleaving strategy), not the ANSWER (3 heavy types → F + Bento → this CSS).

**The trap:** "My content also has code examples and explanations, so I'll use F-Pattern with Bento peak and velocity interleaving."

**The correct path:** "My content has code examples. Phase 1-2 tension derivation will reveal MY axis and density patterns. It might converge to F + Bento + velocity interleaving (genuine independent discovery) or diverge completely. I won't know until after Phase 3."

---

## 2. Purpose of This Case Study

**What this case study proves:** Heavy component types (HEAVY velocity: Code Snippet, Reasoning, Core Abstraction) CAN coexist on one page when velocity interleaving (CD-F-001) prevents same-velocity stacking.

**What tension type it addresses:** Technical Depth vs Readability tension (dense code + explanations vs accessible reading flow).

**What mechanism it demonstrates:**
- Velocity interleaving (CD-F-001: never stack same-velocity components)
- F-Pattern to Bento transition via BRIDGE (AD-F-025)
- CRESCENDO density (sparse intro → dense peak → sparse resolution)
- Heavy component deployment (3 heavy types managed through interleaving)
- Composite component handling (N2: pre-composed, never nested)

## 3. Tension That Produced This

### Content Analyzed

**Content:** "Reasoning Inside Code" — Deep technical explanation integrating code examples with conceptual reasoning and core abstractions.

**Subject:** Software architecture philosophy (why code structure matters, not how to write specific code)

**Word count:** ~5,400 words across progressive sections (intro → building → climax → resolution)

**Content type:** Deep Dive (technical depth + conceptual framework)

### Phase 1 — Multi-Axis Questioning (Actual Questions)

**Technical Depth vs Readability Axis:**
- Q: Does content require both code examples AND conceptual explanations?
- A: YES — Code alone doesn't teach philosophy, explanation alone lacks grounding
- Opposition: Technical depth (code-heavy) ←→ Readability (prose-heavy)
- Overlap: Both serve understanding
- Width: 9/10 (extreme tension — code + reasoning create density overload risk)

**Component Velocity Axis:**
- Q: Does content have 3 HEAVY component types (Code Snippet, Reasoning, Core Abstraction)?
- A: YES — All three are slow-reading, high-cognitive-load components
- Opposition: Heavy components (slow) ←→ Fast components (quick scan)
- Overlap: Both convey information
- Width: 8/10 (critical tension — stacking heavy = velocity mismatch violation per T2)

**Narrative Flow Axis:**
- Q: Does content follow setup → climax → resolution arc?
- A: YES — Introduction (sparse) → Deep Examples (dense) → Synthesis (breathing)
- Opposition: Narrative arc (progressive) ←→ Reference structure (flat)
- Overlap: Both serve comprehension
- Width: 7/10 (strong tension — arc demands CRESCENDO density, but code density is static)

**Structural Complexity Axis:**
- Q: Does content need complex nesting (code inside reasoning inside abstraction)?
- A: NO — Content needs these components sequenced, not nested
- Opposition: Nested depth ←→ Flat sequencing
- Overlap: Both create relationships
- Width: 6/10 (moderate tension — nesting feels natural but violates N1 rule)

### Phase 2 — Tension Derivation (Actual Table)

| Side A | Opposition | Side B | Overlap | Width Score |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Technical depth (code-heavy) | ←→ | Readability (prose-heavy) | Both serve understanding | 9/10 |
| Heavy components (slow reading) | ←→ | Fast components (quick scan) | Both convey info | 8/10 |
| Narrative arc (progressive) | ←→ | Reference (flat) | Both serve comprehension | 7/10 |
| Nested complexity | ←→ | Flat sequencing | Both create relationships | 6/10 |

**Richness Score:** 30/40 → 75% → Track 2 warranted (deep dive requires multi-axis care)

### What Axes Were Explored

**Explored:**
1. Technical Depth vs Readability (PRODUCTIVE — led to velocity interleaving discovery)
2. Component Velocity (PRODUCTIVE — led to CD-F-001: never stack same-velocity)
3. Narrative Flow (PRODUCTIVE — led to CRESCENDO density + F-Pattern vertical descent)
4. Structural Complexity (PRODUCTIVE — led to flat sequencing, rejecting nesting per N1)

**Rejected:**
1. Tutorial vs Reference (REJECTED — content is philosophical, neither tutorial nor reference)
2. Beginner vs Expert (REJECTED — depth assumes competence but doesn't target expertise level)

### What Candidates Were Considered and Rejected

**Metaphor Candidates Considered:**

1. **Nested Hierarchy** (rejected — CRITICAL rejection)
   - Why tried: Code inside Reasoning inside Core Abstraction feels conceptually nested
   - Why rejected: Violates N1 (components stack not nest) and N4 (depth limit = 1) — creates perceptual confusion

2. **Uniform F-Pattern Descent** (rejected)
   - Why tried: F-Pattern suits vertical progressive content
   - Why rejected: Code blocks (HEAVY) + Reasoning blocks (HEAVY) stacked = velocity mismatch violation (T2)

3. **Bento Grid Throughout** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Bento Grid contains heavy components well (AD-F-009)
   - Why rejected: Narrative arc (CRESCENDO) doesn't suit flat grid structure — need vertical progression

4. **F-Pattern with Velocity Interleaving + Bento Peak** (SELECTED)
   - Why tried: F-Pattern supports narrative descent, Bento Grid contains heavy clusters at climax, velocity interleaving prevents stacking
   - Why it worked: Combines vertical flow (F), heavy containment (Bento), and velocity management (interleaving)

## 4. The Search in Action

### The Metaphor Discovery Moment

**The insight:** The problem isn't component TYPES (Code, Reasoning, Abstraction are all valid). The problem is component VELOCITY. All three are HEAVY. Stacking heavy components = cognitive overload.

**Why this metaphor resonated:** Traditional technical docs stack code → explanation → code → explanation (alternating types). This exploration discovered: type alternation ISN'T ENOUGH. Velocity matters more than type. Code + Reasoning are both HEAVY, so alternating them STILL violates velocity rule.

### What Made This Metaphor Resonate with the Tensions

**Tension 1 (Technical Depth vs Readability):**
- Metaphor resolution: Technical depth = heavy components present, Readability = velocity interleaving prevents overload
- Why it works: Velocity interleaving (FAST callout between two HEAVY code blocks) creates breathing space

**Tension 2 (Component Velocity):**
- Metaphor resolution: Never stack same-velocity components (CD-F-001 discovery)
- Why it works: Heavy → FAST → Heavy → MEDIUM → Heavy creates rhythm, prevents monotony

**Tension 3 (Narrative Flow):**
- Metaphor resolution: F-Pattern vertical descent = narrative progression, Bento Grid at climax = heavy clustering
- Why it works: F-Pattern supports CRESCENDO (sparse intro → dense middle), Bento contains peak density

**Tension 4 (Structural Complexity):**
- Metaphor resolution: Flat sequencing (Code, then Reasoning, then Abstraction) instead of nesting
- Why it works: N1 rule (stack not nest) + N2 rule (pre-compose composites) prevent depth violations

### The Moment of Collapse

**The collapse moment:** Realizing that the R5 combination theory finding (T2: velocity mismatch rule) IS the design constraint. The content has 3 heavy types. The ONLY way to deploy them is velocity interleaving.

**Before collapse:** Four separate layout problems:
1. How to integrate code + reasoning + abstractions?
2. How to prevent cognitive overload from heavy components?
3. How to maintain narrative arc (CRESCENDO)?
4. How to avoid nesting violations (N1, N4)?

**After collapse:** ONE principle (velocity interleaving) resolves all four:
1. Integration = sequencing heavy components with fast spacers between
2. Prevent overload = FAST components break heavy stacks
3. Narrative arc = F-Pattern descent to Bento peak (CRESCENDO structure)
4. Avoid nesting = flat sequencing (components stack, don't nest)

### How the Metaphor Dictated Structure

**The metaphor DICTATED:**

1. **F-Pattern for progressive sections**
   - Metaphor demanded: Vertical descent (top → bottom reading) for narrative arc
   - Not negotiable: CRESCENDO density requires vertical progression (can't use Z-Pattern diagonal or Bento flat grid)

2. **Velocity interleaving rule**
   - Metaphor demanded: Heavy → FAST → Heavy → MEDIUM → Heavy (never Heavy → Heavy)
   - Not negotiable: T2 velocity mismatch = cognitive jarring (researched finding)

3. **Bento Grid at climax section**
   - Metaphor demanded: Peak density (most heavy components) needs containment structure
   - Not negotiable: AD-F-009 (Bento contains islands) — grid cells isolate heavy components

4. **BRIDGE transition F → Bento**
   - Metaphor demanded: Prose paragraph signals axis shift (F descent → Bento grid)
   - Not negotiable: AD-F-025 (BRIDGE transition for incompatible topologies)

5. **Flat sequencing (no nesting)**
   - Metaphor demanded: Code components adjacent to Reasoning components, not nested inside
   - Not negotiable: N1 (stack not nest), N4 (depth limit = 1) — nesting creates perceptual chaos

6. **Composite components pre-composed**
   - Metaphor demanded: Reasoning component (label + content + citation) built as single unit
   - Not negotiable: N2 rule (composites pre-composed, not assembled on page)

### Where Mechanisms Were Applied

**Mechanisms applied from catalog:**

1. **Velocity Interleaving** (Mechanism: CD-F-001 — discovered in THIS exploration)
   - Applied: Code (HEAVY) → Info Callout (FAST) → Reasoning (HEAVY) → Prose (MEDIUM) → Core Abstraction (HEAVY)
   - Why here: 3 heavy component types require interleaving to prevent same-velocity stacking

2. **F-Pattern Vertical Descent** (Mechanism: AD-F-005 CRESCENDO)
   - Applied: Sections progress top → bottom with increasing density
   - Why here: Narrative arc (setup → climax → resolution) maps to vertical flow

3. **Bento Grid Heavy Containment** (Mechanism: AD-F-009)
   - Applied: Climax section uses Bento Grid to contain multiple heavy components
   - Why here: Peak density (4+ heavy components) needs grid isolation

4. **BRIDGE Transition** (Mechanism: AD-F-025)
   - Applied: Prose paragraph bridges F-Pattern Section 2 → Bento Grid Section 3
   - Why here: F (vertical descent) and Bento (island grid) have incompatible attention topologies

5. **Flat Sequencing** (Mechanism: N1 + N4)
   - Applied: Components stack vertically, never nest (no Code inside Reasoning)
   - Why here: Nesting depth > 1 creates perceptual confusion (N4 research finding)

6. **Composite Component Pre-Composition** (Mechanism: N2)
   - Applied: Reasoning component built as label + content + citation unit in CSS
   - Why here: Building composite on page (via HTML nesting) violates N2 — must be CSS-composed

7. **CRESCENDO Density** (Mechanism: DD-002)
   - Applied: Sparse intro (80px padding) → Dense middle (24px padding) → Breathing outro (56px padding)
   - Why here: Narrative arc demands progressive density building to climax

## 5. What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)

### ☑ REUSABLE MECHANISMS (Apply to YOUR metaphor)

☑ **Velocity Interleaving** — Works for ANY content with multiple heavy components
   - What it is: Never stack same-velocity components (Heavy → FAST → Heavy, not Heavy → Heavy)
   - Why reusable: Velocity mismatch (T2) is universal cognitive principle
   - How to adapt: Identify YOUR component velocities (Code = HEAVY, Prose = MEDIUM, Callout = FAST), interleave

☑ **F-Pattern to Bento Transition** — Works for ANY narrative arc with peak density
   - What it is: F-Pattern vertical descent → BRIDGE prose → Bento Grid at climax
   - Why reusable: CRESCENDO structure (building to peak) naturally fits F → Bento
   - How to adapt: Use F-Pattern for progressive sections, switch to Bento when density peaks (4+ heavy components clustered)

☑ **Flat Sequencing** — Works for ANY complex content
   - What it is: Components stack vertically, never nest (no component inside component)
   - Why reusable: N1 rule (stack not nest) prevents perceptual depth violations
   - How to adapt: When tempted to nest (Code inside Reasoning), sequence instead (Code, then Reasoning)

☑ **Composite Component Pre-Composition** — Works for ANY multi-part component
   - What it is: Build composite components (Reasoning = label + content + citation) in CSS, not HTML nesting
   - Why reusable: N2 rule (pre-compose composites) keeps HTML flat, CSS handles structure
   - How to adapt: Define YOUR composite components (card = header + body + footer) in CSS classes, not HTML `<div>` trees

☑ **BRIDGE Transition for Incompatible Topologies** — Works for ANY axis change with structural conflict
   - What it is: Prose paragraph signals axis shift (F vertical descent → Bento grid)
   - Why reusable: AD-F-025 BRIDGE type — incompatible topologies need explicit reset
   - How to adapt: When YOUR axis change is dramatic (F → Spiral, Z → Choreography), insert prose bridge

☑ **Bento Heavy Containment** — Works for ANY section with 4+ heavy components clustered
   - What it is: Use Bento Grid to isolate heavy components in grid cells
   - Why reusable: AD-F-009 (Bento contains islands) — grid cells prevent heavy-component bleed
   - How to adapt: When YOUR peak section has multiple code blocks or reasoning blocks, use Bento Grid

☑ **CRESCENDO Density for Narrative Arc** — Works for ANY content with setup → climax → resolution
   - What it is: Sparse intro → Dense middle → Breathing outro (padding progression: 80px → 24px → 56px)
   - Why reusable: Narrative arc naturally maps to density progression
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR narrative phases to density (intro = breathing space, climax = compression)

### ✗ NOT REUSABLE (Metaphor-Specific)

✗ **3 heavy component types** (Code, Reasoning, Core Abstraction)
   - Why not reusable: YOUR content may have 1 heavy type, 5 heavy types, or no heavy types
   - The decision: Content philosophy required code examples + conceptual reasoning + abstractions

✗ **Specific velocity interleaving pattern** (Heavy → FAST → Heavy → MEDIUM → Heavy)
   - Why not reusable: Derived from THIS content's component distribution
   - YOUR metaphor: May need Heavy → Heavy → FAST → Heavy (different rhythm)

✗ **F-Pattern for sections 1-2, Bento for section 3**
   - Why not reusable: YOUR content may need Bento throughout, or F throughout, or different sequence
   - The decision: Narrative arc (progressive) suited F, climax density suited Bento

✗ **Section word counts** (~1,800 / ~2,400 / ~1,200 words)
   - Why not reusable: Derived from THIS content's arc depth needs
   - YOUR metaphor: May have balanced sections or different distribution

✗ **Specific BRIDGE placement** (between Section 2 and Section 3)
   - Why not reusable: YOUR axis boundaries may occur at different points
   - The decision: F-to-Bento shift occurred at climax (where density peaks)

✗ **CRESCENDO peak at Section 3**
   - Why not reusable: YOUR narrative arc may peak at Section 2, Section 4, or have multiple peaks
   - The decision: Content climax (synthesis moment) occurred in middle section

### If Convergence Detected (Any "Similar" boxes checked)

**You MUST provide STRONG evidence of independent derivation:**

#### Evidence of Independent Convergence

**Requirement:** Show your Phase 1-2 work proving you derived this metaphor independently.

1. **Phase 1 Multi-Axis Questions:**
   [Paste your actual questions — must be content-specific, not copied from this case study]

2. **Phase 2 Tension Table:**
   [Paste your actual tension derivation — must show genuine opposition + overlap analysis]

3. **Phase 3 Search Query:**
   [Paste your query — must be constructed from YOUR tensions, not adapted from this case study]

4. **Convergence Explanation:**
   [Explain WHY your independent process led to same metaphor]

   Example:
   > "My content ALSO had multiple heavy component types (code + diagrams + technical explanations). Velocity interleaving emerged independently because: (1) T2 velocity mismatch rule applies universally, (2) stacking heavy components creates cognitive overload (researched finding). Convergence is genuine — two different heavy-component contents led to same interleaving solution."

#### If You Cannot Provide Strong Evidence

**STOP. You pattern-matched.**

Re-run Phase 3 with explicit constraint: **"Velocity interleaving with F → Bento is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"**

**Alternative strategies to explore:**
- Tabbed sections (heavy components hidden behind tabs, not stacked)
- Accordion collapse (expand one heavy section at a time)
- Side-by-side split (code left, reasoning right — spatial not sequential)
- Bento Grid throughout (all heavy components in grid cells, no F-Pattern descent)
- [Generate 3 more alternatives specific to YOUR content]

### If Divergence Confirmed (All "Different" boxes checked)

**You successfully diverged. Extract the mechanisms, ignore the layout.**

#### Successful Divergence — What to Do Next

1. **Extract applicable mechanisms** (Section 5 — Reusable list)
   - Review ☑ mechanisms
   - Select 2-4 most relevant to YOUR metaphor
   - Ignore metaphor-specific decisions (✗ items)

2. **Proceed to implementation** (Phase 4 in tension-composition skill)
   - Use mechanisms catalog as toolbox
   - Build YOUR metaphor, not this one

3. **Contribute to library growth**
   - Your metaphor will become a NEW case study
   - Library grows (enriches), doesn't repeat

### Regeneration Path (If Pattern-Matching Detected)

**If you realized you pattern-matched AFTER reading this case study:**

1. **Acknowledge it** — Pattern-matching isn't "wrong," but it's NOT creative derivation
2. **Decide:**
   - Option A: Accept pattern-match, document as "Adapted from CD-001 velocity interleaving case study"
   - Option B: Regenerate with constraint ("velocity interleaving + F → Bento is taken, what ELSE works?")
3. **If regenerating:**
   - Return to Phase 2 tension table
   - Add constraint: "Velocity interleaving with F-Pattern → Bento transition is off-limits"
   - Re-run Phase 3 search with constraint active
   - Generate 3+ alternative heavy-component strategies
   - Select best alternative, commit BEFORE re-reading library

# Anti-Prescription Case Study Template

**Purpose:** This template structures ALL case study documentation to prevent pattern-matching while enabling mechanism extraction.

**Version:** 1.0 (Wave 0 — Phase C Extraction)
**Date:** 2026-02-14

## 1. NOT A TEMPLATE Warning

**⚠️ THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE — IT IS A CASE STUDY**

This document shows what ONE metaphor produced for ONE specific content. Pattern-matching to this output defeats the purpose.

**Why this warning exists:**

When you see a worked example — geological stratification with 6 layers, specific padding values, geological vocabulary — your working memory treats it as a TEMPLATE to adapt, not a PROOF to study.

This is pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.

**Your assignment:** Extract the PROCESS (how tension → metaphor → layout), not the ANSWER (geological → 6 layers → this CSS).

**The trap:** "My content has certainty gradients too, so I'll use geological stratification."

**The correct path:** "My content has certainty gradients. Phase 1-2 tension derivation will reveal MY metaphor. It might converge to geological (genuine independent discovery) or diverge completely. I won't know until after Phase 3."

---

## 2. Purpose of This Case Study

**What this case study proves:** [Specific tension type] CAN be compositionally resolved.

**Example:**
> "Warmth/austerity tension (practical warmth vs theoretical rigor) CAN be resolved via depth-based metaphors that encode certainty as spatial position."

**What tension type it addresses:** [Specific opposition from Phase 2 tension derivation]

**Example:**
> "Content with opposing needs: accessible entry points (warmth) + rigorous technical depth (austerity). Opposition width: 8/10 (strong genuine tension)."

**What mechanism it demonstrates:** [Reusable techniques visible in this execution]

**Example:**
> "Border-weight gradient encoding (4px/3px/1px maps to high/medium/low confidence), spacing compression (padding decreases with depth), background progression (darkening encodes stability)."

**This section frames the reader's expectation:**

You are studying a RESULT (what happened when THIS content met THIS process), not copying a RECIPE (steps to follow for similar content).

## 3. Tension That Produced This

**NARRATIVE of actual Phase 1-2 work — the story of how content tensions were identified.**

This is NOT:
- ❌ Generic criteria ("When content has X property, use this pattern")
- ❌ Abstract theory ("Tension types fall into 3 categories")
- ❌ Prescriptive checklist ("If yes to 4+ questions, proceed to geological")

This IS:
- ✅ Specific content description ("Boris documentation — 6,200 words on procedural depth")
- ✅ Actual Phase 1 multi-axis questions asked ("Warmth vs Austerity: Does this content balance practical steps with theoretical rigor?")
- ✅ Real Phase 2 tension table (opposition + overlap + width scoring)
- ✅ Richness score calculation (how we got to 17/20)

**STRUCTURE:**

```markdown
### Content Analyzed
[Specific content — title, type, word count, subject matter]

Example:
> **Content:** Boris Documentation — Procedural depth guide (6,200 words)
> **Subject:** Software development methodology with certainty spectrum

### Phase 1 — Multi-Axis Questioning (Actual Questions)

[Show the ACTUAL questions asked for THIS content, not generic templates]

Example:
> **Warmth vs Austerity Axis:**
> - Q: Does content balance practical warmth (step-by-step) with theoretical austerity (formal definitions)?
> - A: YES — 40% quickstart guides (warm) + 60% technical theory (austere)
>
> **Confidence Spectrum Axis:**
> - Q: Does content encode certainty levels (established facts vs speculative techniques)?
> - A: YES — 6 natural groupings from "universal principles" to "experimental approaches"

### Phase 2 — Tension Derivation (Actual Table)

[Show the ACTUAL tension table, not a hypothetical example]

Example:
> | Side A | Opposition | Side B | Overlap | Width Score |
> |--------|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
> | Warmth: practical steps | ←→ | Austerity: theoretical rigor | Both serve learning | 8/10 |
> | High confidence facts | ←→ | Speculative hypotheses | Both are necessary knowledge | 9/10 |
> | Surface-level quickstart | ←→ | Deep technical implementation | Progressive depth | 7/10 |
>
> **Richness Score:** 24/30 → 80% → Track 2 warranted

### What Axes Were Explored

[List ALL axes considered, including rejected ones]

Example:
> **Explored:**
> 1. Warmth vs Austerity (PRODUCTIVE — led to depth metaphor)
> 2. Confidence vs Speculation (PRODUCTIVE — led to stability encoding)
> 3. Simple vs Complex (REJECTED — content is uniformly complex)
> 4. Linear vs Networked (REJECTED — content is primarily linear)

### What Candidates Were Considered and Rejected

[Show the search process — what metaphors were tried and why they failed]

Example:
> **Metaphor Candidates Considered:**
>
> 1. **Library Catalog** (rejected)
>    - Why tried: Content has classification/organization
>    - Why rejected: Doesn't encode confidence/certainty
>
> 2. **Construction Blueprints** (rejected)
>    - Why tried: Layered detail (overview → detailed plans)
>    - Why rejected: Implies prescriptive steps, content is descriptive
>
> 3. **Geological Core** (SELECTED)
>    - Why tried: Depth + stability (deeper = older = more established)
>    - Why it worked: Natural mapping of certainty to spatial depth
```

**CRITICAL:** This must be specific to the content that produced this layout. Generic criteria = prescription.

---

## 4. The Search in Action

**HOW the metaphor emerged — specific to THIS content.**

This section makes the derivation process VISIBLE. It's a STORY, not a RECIPE.

**STRUCTURE:**

```markdown
### The Metaphor Discovery Moment

[Describe the specific insight when the metaphor emerged]

Example:
> **The insight:** Content had 6 natural groupings by certainty level. The geological metaphor suggested treating high-certainty content as "bedrock" (deep, dark, stable) and low-certainty as "topsoil" (surface, light, dynamic).
>
> **Why this metaphor resonated:** Earth's geological layers encode BOTH depth (surface → core) and time/stability (recent sediment → ancient bedrock). This dual encoding matched the content's dual need: organize by depth AND signal confidence.

### What Made This Metaphor Resonate with the Tensions

[Connect the metaphor properties to the Phase 2 tensions]

Example:
> **Tension 1 (Warmth vs Austerity):**
> - Metaphor resolution: Warmth = accessible surface layers (topsoil), Austerity = deep bedrock
> - Why it works: Geological depth is FAMILIAR (everyone knows surface vs deep) yet RIGOROUS (scientific precision)
>
> **Tension 2 (Confidence vs Speculation):**
> - Metaphor resolution: Confidence = depth (deeper = more established/stable)
> - Why it works: Geological time NATURALLY encodes stability (older = more tested/proven)

### The Moment of Collapse

[When did multiple tensions resolve into a single spatial idea?]

Example:
> **The collapse moment:** Realizing that geological DEPTH simultaneously resolves three tensions:
> 1. Warmth/Austerity (surface familiarity vs deep rigor)
> 2. Confidence/Speculation (deep stability vs surface dynamics)
> 3. Progressive disclosure (surface entry → deep exploration)
>
> **Before collapse:** Three separate layout problems
> **After collapse:** ONE spatial metaphor (vertical depth) resolves all three

### How the Metaphor Dictated Structure

[Show how the metaphor generated layout decisions]

Example:
> **The metaphor DICTATED:**
>
> 1. **6-layer structure** (matching 6 content certainty groupings)
>    - Metaphor demanded: strata count = content grouping count
>    - Not negotiable: geological layers are discrete, bounded
>
> 2. **Depth gradient** (darkening background, reducing padding)
>    - Metaphor demanded: deeper = darker + denser (compression from geological weight)
>    - Not negotiable: depth MUST be perceptually encoded
>
> 3. **Geological vocabulary** (bedrock, strata, topsoil)
>    - Metaphor demanded: labels reinforce spatial metaphor
>    - Not negotiable: generic labels (Layer 1-6) break metaphor coherence

### Where Mechanisms Were Applied

[Connect this metaphor to reusable techniques from MECHANISM-CATALOG.md]

Example:
> **Mechanisms applied from catalog:**
>
> 1. **Border-weight encoding** (Mechanism #7)
>    - Applied: 4px borders on bedrock (high confidence), 1px on topsoil (low confidence)
>    - Why here: Metaphor needed confidence encoding; border-weight was the technique
>
> 2. **Spacing compression** (Mechanism #12)
>    - Applied: 48px padding → 24px padding as depth increases
>    - Why here: Geological weight compresses lower layers
>
> 3. **2-zone component DNA** (Mechanism #3)
>    - Applied: Each stratum has sparse label + dense content
>    - Why here: Fractal self-similarity (whole page structure mirrors component structure)
```

**CRITICAL:** This is NARRATIVE (what happened), not RECIPE (what to do).

## 5. What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)

**Two columns: Reusable vs Not Reusable**

This section EXPLICITLY separates techniques (applicable to ANY metaphor) from metaphor-specific decisions (only applicable to geological).

### ✅ REUSABLE MECHANISMS (Apply to YOUR metaphor)

[List techniques with explanations]

**FORMAT:**

```markdown
☑ **[Mechanism Name]** — [General applicability]

Example:
☑ **Border-weight gradient** — Works for ANY hierarchy/confidence/importance encoding
   - What it is: Use border thickness (4px/3px/1px) to encode semantic levels
   - Why reusable: Hierarchy is universal; thickness is a parameter
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR hierarchy (not certainty) to border-weight scale

☑ **Spacing compression** — Works for ANY depth/density/intensity gradient
   - What it is: Decrease padding/margin along a progression
   - Why reusable: Compression encodes "more" (depth, density, weight)
   - How to adapt: Identify YOUR gradient axis (depth, time, complexity)

☑ **Background progression** — Works for ANY continuous spectrum encoding
   - What it is: Gradual background color shift (light → dark or warm → cool)
   - Why reusable: Color progression is perceptually intuitive
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR spectrum (not stability) to color progression
```

### ✗ NOT REUSABLE (Metaphor-Specific)

[List decisions tied to geological metaphor]

**FORMAT:**

```markdown
✗ **[Decision Type]** — Why it's metaphor-specific

Example:
✗ **6-layer structure** — Specific to THIS content's certainty groupings
   - Why not reusable: YOUR content may have 3 layers, 10 layers, or continuous spectrum
   - The decision: Stratum count matched content groupings (contingent fact)

✗ **Geological vocabulary** (strata, bedrock, topsoil, core)
   - Why not reusable: Only makes sense within geological metaphor
   - The decision: Labels reinforce metaphor coherence (metaphor-dependent)

✗ **Specific padding values** (48px → 40px → 32px → 24px)
   - Why not reusable: Derived from THIS content's depth needs + viewport constraints
   - The decision: Compression ratio tuned to perceptual floor (context-specific)

✗ **Darkening background** (cream → tan → warm-gray progression)
   - Why not reusable: Darkness encodes STABILITY (geological-specific meaning)
   - YOUR metaphor: Might encode with color HUE, not brightness
```

**CRITICAL:** Every item must be explicitly marked ☑ (reusable) or ✗ (not reusable).

## 6. Your Divergence Assignment

**Full table format: Compare YOUR metaphor to this one.**

This section FORCES explicit comparison and justification if convergence occurs.

### Divergence Verification Table

```markdown
| Comparison Dimension | This Case Study | Your Metaphor | Convergence? | Justification Required |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Core Metaphor** | Geological stratification | [Your metaphor] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Spatial Encoding** | Vertical depth (surface → bedrock) | [Your encoding] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Primary Tension** | Warmth/Austerity + Confidence spectrum | [Your tensions] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Structural Pattern** | 6 discrete layers (strata) | [Your structure] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Visual Treatment** | Darkening + compression gradient | [Your treatment] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
```

### If Convergence Detected (Any "Similar" boxes checked)

**You MUST provide STRONG evidence of independent derivation:**

```markdown
#### Evidence of Independent Convergence

**Requirement:** Show your Phase 1-2 work proving you derived this metaphor independently.

1. **Phase 1 Multi-Axis Questions:**
   [Paste your actual questions — must be content-specific, not copied from this case study]

2. **Phase 2 Tension Table:**
   [Paste your actual tension derivation — must show genuine opposition + overlap analysis]

3. **Phase 3 Search Query:**
   [Paste your query — must be constructed from YOUR tensions, not adapted from this case study]

4. **Convergence Explanation:**
   [Explain WHY your independent process led to same metaphor]

   Example:
   > "My content ALSO had 6-level certainty hierarchy + depth tension. Geological metaphor emerged independently because depth + stability are NATURAL pairings (not arbitrary). Convergence is genuine — two different contents with similar tension structures led to similar metaphors."

#### If You Cannot Provide Strong Evidence

**STOP. You pattern-matched.**

Re-run Phase 3 with explicit constraint: **"Geological is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"**

**Alternative metaphors to explore:**
- Oceanic depth (surface → abyss) — similar but aquatic
- Architectural foundation (roofline → bedrock) — similar but built environment
- Tree root system (canopy → taproot) — organic depth encoding
- [Generate 3 more alternatives specific to YOUR content]
```

### If Divergence Confirmed (All "Different" boxes checked)

**You successfully diverged. Extract the mechanisms, ignore the layout.**

```markdown
#### Successful Divergence — What to Do Next

1. **Extract applicable mechanisms** (Section 5 — Reusable list)
   - Review ☑ mechanisms
   - Select 2-4 most relevant to YOUR metaphor
   - Ignore metaphor-specific decisions (✗ items)

2. **Proceed to implementation** (Phase 4 in tension-composition skill)
   - Use mechanisms catalog as toolbox
   - Build YOUR metaphor, not this one

3. **Contribute to library growth**
   - Your metaphor will become a NEW case study
   - Library grows (enriches), doesn't repeat
```

### Regeneration Path (If Pattern-Matching Detected)

**If you realized you pattern-matched AFTER reading this case study:**

1. **Acknowledge it** — Pattern-matching isn't "wrong," but it's NOT creative derivation
2. **Decide:**
   - Option A: Accept pattern-match, document as "Adapted from geological case study"
   - Option B: Regenerate with constraint ("geological is taken, what ELSE works?")
3. **If regenerating:**
   - Return to Phase 2 tension table
   - Add constraint: "Geological metaphor is off-limits"
   - Re-run Phase 3 search with constraint active
   - Generate 3+ alternative metaphors
   - Select best alternative, commit BEFORE re-reading library

## TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES (For Wave 3 Case Study Writers)

### How to Use This Template

1. **Copy this structure** for each case study you document
2. **Fill each section** with ACTUAL content from the exploration you're documenting
3. **Do NOT use generic language** — every example must be specific to that exploration
4. **Verify compliance:**
   - ☐ Section 1: NOT A TEMPLATE warning present
   - ☐ Section 3: Shows ACTUAL Phase 1-2 work (not criteria)
   - ☐ Section 4: NARRATIVE story (not recipe steps)
   - ☐ Section 5: Mechanisms explicitly separated (☑ vs ✗)
   - ☐ Section 6: Divergence table complete with regeneration path

### What Makes This Anti-Prescription

**PRESCRIPTION (what we're avoiding):**
```markdown
## When to Use Geological Stratification

**Use this pattern when:**
- Content has 4+ certainty levels
- Information has natural depth layering
- Readers need progressive disclosure

**Recipe:**
1. Identify certainty groupings
2. Map to geological layers (surface = low certainty)
3. Apply depth gradient (padding compression + background darkening)
```

**ANTI-PRESCRIPTION (what this template produces):**
```markdown
## Tension That Produced Geological Stratification

**Boris content had:** 6 certainty groupings, warmth/austerity tension

**Phase 1-2 revealed:** Depth + stability as core spatial metaphor candidates

**Geological emerged because:** Natural pairing of depth (spatial) + time (stability)

**What YOU extract:** Border-weight technique (reusable), NOT 6-layer structure (metaphor-specific)

**Divergence requirement:** If your metaphor is geological, prove independent derivation OR regenerate
```

### Binary Rules for Case Study Writers

**YOU MUST:**
- ✅ Use this template structure (6 sections, this order)
- ✅ Show ACTUAL Phase 1-2 work (paste real tension tables)
- ✅ Use NARRATIVE format in Section 4 (story, not steps)
- ✅ Separate mechanisms from metaphor (Section 5 — ☑ vs ✗)
- ✅ Include divergence table (Section 6)

**YOU MUST NOT:**
- ❌ Use "When to use" anywhere in the document (the word "when" followed by "use" in instruction context is PROHIBITED)
- ❌ Write recipe language ("Step 1: Do X, Step 2: Do Y")
- ❌ Provide generic criteria lists ("Use if content has X, Y, Z properties")
- ❌ Skip the NOT A TEMPLATE warning (Section 1)
- ❌ Skip the divergence assignment (Section 6)

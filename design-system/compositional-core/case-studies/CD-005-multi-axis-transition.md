# CD-005: Multi-Axis Transition — Case Study

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Exploration ID:** CD-005-multi-axis-transition.html
**Audit Score:** 38/40
**Density:** WAVE (oscillating MED/HIGH/MED-HIGH)
**Organization:** SPATIAL (position-based)

## 1. NOT A TEMPLATE Warning

**THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE.** This case study documents what ONE specific metaphor produced for ONE specific content. Pattern-matching to this output defeats the purpose of tension-derived composition.

**Why this warning exists:**

When you see a worked example — three axis patterns (Z → F → Bento) with SMOOTH and BRIDGE transitions, WAVE density oscillation, specific transition elements between sections — your working memory treats it as a TEMPLATE to adapt, not a PROOF to study.

This is pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.

**Your assignment:** Extract the PROCESS (how multi-axis content → transition grammar → sequential deployment), not the ANSWER (3 axes → SMOOTH transition → this CSS).

**The trap:** "My content also has multiple topics, so I'll use Z → F → Bento sequence."

**The correct path:** "My content has multiple topics. Phase 1-2 tension derivation will reveal MY axis sequence. It might converge to Z → F → Bento (genuine independent discovery) or diverge completely. I won't know until after Phase 3."

---

## 2. Purpose of This Case Study

**What this case study proves:** Multiple axis patterns (3+) CAN coexist sequentially on one page when transition grammar (AD-F-025) is applied correctly AND when each section commits to ONE pattern (AD-F-024).

**What tension type it addresses:** Complexity vs Clarity tension (rich multi-topic content vs readable single-topic flow).

**What mechanism it demonstrates:**
- Sequential axis deployment (AD-F-024: no simultaneous axes)
- Transition grammar types (SMOOTH: shared component bridge between Z and F, BRIDGE: prose paragraph between F and Bento)
- WAVE density oscillation (MEDIUM → HIGH → MEDIUM-HIGH across 3 sections)
- SPATIAL organization (position-based content grouping)

## 3. Tension That Produced This

### Content Analyzed

**Content:** "Multi-Axis Transition Study" — A page testing whether 3 different axis patterns can work sequentially without cognitive whiplash.

**Subject:** Design pattern exploration (demonstrating axis combination, not teaching it)

**Word count:** ~4,800 words across 3 major sections

**Content type:** Exploration + Proof-of-concept

### Phase 1 — Multi-Axis Questioning (Actual Questions)

**Complexity vs Clarity Axis:**
- Q: Does content have 3 distinct topics that each deserve their own reading pattern?
- A: YES — Section 1 (overview) suits Z-Pattern, Section 2 (deep content) suits F-Pattern, Section 3 (reference cards) suits Bento Grid
- Opposition: Complex (multiple patterns) ←→ Clear (single pattern)
- Overlap: Both serve content comprehension
- Width: 8/10 (strong tension — multiple patterns risk disorientation)

**Topic Separation Axis:**
- Q: Are the 3 topics clearly separated (not overlapping)?
- A: YES — Overview → Deep Dive → Reference are distinct phases
- Opposition: Integrated (topics blend) ←→ Separated (topics discrete)
- Overlap: Both serve information architecture
- Width: 6/10 (moderate tension — separation can feel disjointed)

**Reading Flow Axis:**
- Q: Does reading flow need continuity despite axis changes?
- A: YES — Abrupt axis shifts create cognitive whiplash (velocity mismatch per T2)
- Opposition: Smooth continuity ←→ Clear boundaries
- Overlap: Both serve reading experience
- Width: 7/10 (strong tension — transitions must balance continuity + boundary)

### Phase 2 — Tension Derivation (Actual Table)

| Side A | Opposition | Side B | Overlap | Width Score |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Complex multi-axis (rich) | ←→ | Single axis (clear) | Both serve comprehension | 8/10 |
| Topic separation (discrete) | ←→ | Topic integration (blended) | Both serve architecture | 6/10 |
| Smooth continuity | ←→ | Clear boundaries | Both serve reading flow | 7/10 |
| WAVE density (varied) | ←→ | Uniform density | Both serve rhythm | 5/10 |

**Richness Score:** 26/40 → 65% → Track 2 warranted (multi-axis appropriate, but needs transition care)

### What Axes Were Explored

**Explored:**
1. Complexity vs Clarity (PRODUCTIVE — led to 3-axis sequential deployment)
2. Topic Separation (PRODUCTIVE — led to SPATIAL organization per OD-005)
3. Reading Flow (PRODUCTIVE — led to transition grammar discovery)
4. Density Variation (PRODUCTIVE — led to WAVE oscillation: MED → HIGH → MED-HIGH)

**Rejected:**
1. Linear vs Non-linear (REJECTED — all 3 patterns support linear reading)
2. Expert vs Beginner (REJECTED — content doesn't assume expertise level)

### What Candidates Were Considered and Rejected

**Metaphor Candidates Considered:**

1. **Single Axis with Variation** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Simplest solution — use F-Pattern throughout, vary density
   - Why rejected: Doesn't resolve Complexity vs Clarity — Section 1 (overview) doesn't suit F-Pattern's vertical descent

2. **Simultaneous Axes** (rejected — CRITICAL rejection)
   - Why tried: Deploy Z-Pattern AND F-Pattern in same section
   - Why rejected: Violates AD-F-024 (sequential not simultaneous) — creates attention topology conflict

3. **Abrupt Axis Shifts** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Just change axis at section boundary, no transition
   - Why rejected: Violates AD-F-025 (transition grammar required) — creates cognitive whiplash

4. **Sequential Axes with Transition Grammar** (SELECTED)
   - Why tried: AD-F-024 (sequential) + AD-F-025 (transitions) = tested hypothesis
   - Why it worked: Each section commits to ONE axis, transitions smooth the shifts

## 4. The Search in Action

### The Metaphor Discovery Moment

**The insight:** The content ITSELF is about testing transitions. The metaphor isn't external (geological, manuscript, refinery) — it's STRUCTURAL. The page IS the proof that transitions work.

**Why this metaphor resonated:** Most metaphors are CONTENT metaphors (geological strata, manuscript pages). This is a STRUCTURE metaphor (axis sequence itself). The layout strategy IS the content.

### What Made This Metaphor Resonate with the Tensions

**Tension 1 (Complexity vs Clarity):**
- Metaphor resolution: Complexity = 3 axes (rich topic coverage), Clarity = sequential deployment (no simultaneous confusion)
- Why it works: AD-F-024 principle (sequential not simultaneous) prevents axis conflict

**Tension 2 (Topic Separation):**
- Metaphor resolution: SPATIAL organization (OD-005) groups content by position (Section 1 = top, Section 2 = middle, Section 3 = bottom)
- Why it works: Position-based grouping creates natural separation without forced boundaries

**Tension 3 (Reading Flow):**
- Metaphor resolution: Transition grammar (AD-F-025) bridges axis changes
- Why it works: SMOOTH transition (shared component) between Z and F maintains flow, BRIDGE transition (prose paragraph) between F and Bento signals shift

### The Moment of Collapse

**The collapse moment:** Realizing that the research finding (AD-F-025: transition grammar) IS the design solution. Not applying research TO content — the research IS the content.

**Before collapse:** Three separate layout problems:
1. How to use multiple axes without confusion?
2. How to separate topics clearly?
3. How to maintain reading flow?

**After collapse:** ONE structural principle (transition grammar) resolves all three:
1. Sequential deployment prevents confusion
2. SPATIAL organization creates separation
3. Transition types (SMOOTH, BRIDGE) maintain flow

### How the Metaphor Dictated Structure

**The metaphor DICTATED:**

1. **3-section structure** (one section per axis pattern)
   - Metaphor demanded: Section 1 = Z-Pattern, Section 2 = F-Pattern, Section 3 = Bento Grid
   - Not negotiable: Testing 3 axes requires 3 sections

2. **SMOOTH transition between Z and F**
   - Metaphor demanded: Shared component (callout) bridges the patterns
   - Not negotiable: Z-Pattern Q&A → F-Pattern progressive disclosure needs continuity (AD-F-025 rule: SMOOTH preserves component coherence)

3. **BRIDGE transition between F and Bento**
   - Metaphor demanded: Prose paragraph signals axis shift
   - Not negotiable: F-Pattern vertical descent → Bento Grid island containers needs cognitive reset (AD-F-025 rule: BRIDGE signals topology change)

4. **WAVE density oscillation**
   - Metaphor demanded: MEDIUM (Section 1 overview) → HIGH (Section 2 deep dive) → MEDIUM-HIGH (Section 3 reference)
   - Not negotiable: Density must match section purpose (overview = breathing space, deep dive = compressed detail)

5. **SPATIAL organization**
   - Metaphor demanded: OD-005 position-based grouping (top section = overview, middle = content, bottom = reference)
   - Not negotiable: Spatial position creates implicit hierarchy (top = entry point, bottom = exit)

### Where Mechanisms Were Applied

**Mechanisms applied from catalog:**

1. **Sequential Axis Deployment** (Mechanism: AD-F-024)
   - Applied: Each section commits to ONE axis (no simultaneous Z+F)
   - Why here: Testing transition grammar requires clean axis boundaries

2. **Transition Grammar - SMOOTH type** (Mechanism: AD-F-025)
   - Applied: Callout component bridges Z-Pattern Section 1 → F-Pattern Section 2
   - Why here: Both patterns use callouts — shared component creates continuity

3. **Transition Grammar - BRIDGE type** (Mechanism: AD-F-025)
   - Applied: Prose paragraph bridges F-Pattern Section 2 → Bento Grid Section 3
   - Why here: F (vertical descent) and Bento (island grid) have incompatible topologies — need explicit reset

4. **WAVE Density Oscillation** (Mechanism: DD-specific)
   - Applied: MEDIUM (80px section padding) → HIGH (32px) → MEDIUM-HIGH (48px)
   - Why here: Density variation prevents monotony, matches section purpose

5. **SPATIAL Organization** (Mechanism: OD-005)
   - Applied: Top section = overview (Z-Pattern), Middle = deep content (F-Pattern), Bottom = reference (Bento)
   - Why here: Position-based grouping aligns with natural reading flow (top → bottom)

6. **Velocity Interleaving** (Mechanism: CD-F-001)
   - Applied: FAST callouts interleaved with MEDIUM prose in Section 2
   - Why here: F-Pattern risk = monotonous vertical descent — velocity variation maintains engagement

## 5. What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)

### ☑ REUSABLE MECHANISMS (Apply to YOUR metaphor)

☑ **Sequential Axis Deployment** — Works for ANY multi-topic page
   - What it is: Each section commits to ONE axis pattern (no simultaneous axes)
   - Why reusable: Prevents attention topology conflict (AD-F-024)
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR sections to axis patterns, enforce one-axis-per-section

☑ **SMOOTH Transition** — Works for ANY axis change with shared component type
   - What it is: Use a component present in BOTH patterns to bridge the shift
   - Why reusable: Shared structure creates continuity (AD-F-025 SMOOTH type)
   - How to adapt: Identify component types used in adjacent sections, deploy shared component at boundary

☑ **BRIDGE Transition** — Works for ANY axis change with incompatible topologies
   - What it is: Prose paragraph (or other neutral element) explicitly signals axis shift
   - Why reusable: Incompatible topologies (Z diagonal vs Bento grid) need cognitive reset (AD-F-025 BRIDGE type)
   - How to adapt: If YOUR axis change is dramatic (Z → Spiral, F → Choreography), insert prose bridge

☑ **WAVE Density Oscillation** — Works for ANY page with varying section purposes
   - What it is: Density varies by section (MEDIUM → HIGH → MEDIUM-HIGH)
   - Why reusable: Prevents density monotony, matches section purpose to compression level
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR sections to density needs (overview = sparse, detail = dense)

☑ **SPATIAL Organization** — Works for ANY content with natural top → bottom flow
   - What it is: Position-based content grouping (top = overview, middle = content, bottom = reference)
   - Why reusable: Spatial position creates implicit hierarchy (OD-005)
   - How to adapt: Identify YOUR content's natural position grouping

☑ **Velocity Interleaving** — Works for ANY long vertical section (F-Pattern risk zone)
   - What it is: FAST components (callouts) interleaved with MEDIUM prose
   - Why reusable: Prevents same-velocity monotony (CD-F-001, velocity mismatch rule)
   - How to adapt: In YOUR long sections, vary component velocity (code blocks HEAVY, callouts FAST, prose MEDIUM)

### ✗ NOT REUSABLE (Metaphor-Specific)

✗ **3-section structure** — Specific to testing 3 axes
   - Why not reusable: YOUR content may need 2 sections, 5 sections, or non-sectioned flow
   - The decision: 3 sections matched 3 axis patterns (testing purpose)

✗ **Z → F → Bento sequence** — Specific to THIS content's topic flow
   - Why not reusable: YOUR topics may suit F → Bento → Z, or Z → Z → F, etc.
   - The decision: Overview (Z) → Deep Dive (F) → Reference (Bento) matched natural topic progression

✗ **Specific transition placements** (SMOOTH after Section 1, BRIDGE after Section 2)
   - Why not reusable: YOUR axis boundaries may need different transition types
   - The decision: Z→F similarity (both use Q&A/callouts) = SMOOTH, F→Bento dissimilarity (descent vs grid) = BRIDGE

✗ **MEDIUM → HIGH → MEDIUM-HIGH density progression**
   - Why not reusable: YOUR sections may need LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH, or WAVE with 4 peaks, etc.
   - The decision: Matched section purposes (overview breathes, detail compresses, reference balances)

✗ **Section word counts** (~1,600 / ~2,100 / ~1,100 words)
   - Why not reusable: Derived from THIS content's topic depth needs
   - YOUR metaphor: May have balanced sections, or one dominant section

✗ **Specific SPATIAL grouping** (top = overview, middle = content, bottom = reference)
   - Why not reusable: YOUR content may group differently (top = theory, middle = practice, bottom = troubleshooting)
   - The decision: Position matched typical reading flow expectations

### Divergence Verification Table

| Comparison Dimension | This Case Study | Your Metaphor | Convergence? | Justification Required |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Core Metaphor** | Structural (axis sequence as content) | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Spatial Encoding** | Sequential sections (3 axis patterns) | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Primary Tension** | Complexity vs Clarity + Reading Flow | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Structural Pattern** | Z → SMOOTH → F → BRIDGE → Bento | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |

| **Transition Types** | SMOOTH (shared component) + BRIDGE (prose) | __________ | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |

### If Convergence Detected (Any "Similar" boxes checked)

**You MUST provide STRONG evidence of independent derivation:**

#### Evidence of Independent Convergence

**Requirement:** Show your Phase 1-2 work proving you derived this metaphor independently.

1. **Phase 1 Multi-Axis Questions:**
   [Paste your actual questions — must be content-specific, not copied from this case study]

2. **Phase 2 Tension Table:**
   [Paste your actual tension derivation — must show genuine opposition + overlap analysis]

3. **Phase 3 Search Query:**
   [Paste your query — must be constructed from YOUR tensions, not adapted from this case study]

4. **Convergence Explanation:**
   [Explain WHY your independent process led to same metaphor]

   Example:
   > "My content ALSO had 3 distinct topics requiring different reading patterns. Z → F → Bento sequence emerged independently because: (1) Z-Pattern suits overview, (2) F-Pattern suits deep vertical content, (3) Bento suits reference cards. This is STRUCTURAL convergence (axis-to-content matching), not copying."

#### If You Cannot Provide Strong Evidence

**STOP. You pattern-matched.**

Re-run Phase 3 with explicit constraint: **"Z → F → Bento is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"**

**Alternative axis sequences to explore:**
- F → Bento → Z (deep dive first, overview last)
- Spiral → F → Choreography (intro spiral, content descent, outro choreography)
- Z → Z → Bento (two Z sections with different content, then reference grid)
- Bento → F → Bento (reference → detail → reference sandwich)
- [Generate 3 more alternatives specific to YOUR content]

### If Divergence Confirmed (All "Different" boxes checked)

**You successfully diverged. Extract the mechanisms, ignore the layout.**

#### Successful Divergence — What to Do Next

1. **Extract applicable mechanisms** (Section 5 — Reusable list)
   - Review ☑ mechanisms
   - Select 2-4 most relevant to YOUR metaphor
   - Ignore metaphor-specific decisions (✗ items)

2. **Proceed to implementation** (Phase 4 in tension-composition skill)
   - Use mechanisms catalog as toolbox
   - Build YOUR metaphor, not this one

3. **Contribute to library growth**
   - Your metaphor will become a NEW case study
   - Library grows (enriches), doesn't repeat

### Regeneration Path (If Pattern-Matching Detected)

**If you realized you pattern-matched AFTER reading this case study:**

1. **Acknowledge it** — Pattern-matching isn't "wrong," but it's NOT creative derivation
2. **Decide:**
   - Option A: Accept pattern-match, document as "Adapted from CD-005 multi-axis case study"
   - Option B: Regenerate with constraint ("Z → F → Bento is taken, what ELSE works?")
3. **If regenerating:**
   - Return to Phase 2 tension table
   - Add constraint: "Z → F → Bento sequence is off-limits"
   - Re-run Phase 3 search with constraint active
   - Generate 3+ alternative axis sequences
   - Select best alternative, commit BEFORE re-reading library

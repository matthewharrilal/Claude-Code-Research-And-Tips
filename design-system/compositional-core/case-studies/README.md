# Case Studies Layer — Pattern Proof Gallery

**What this directory contains:** Documentation of what ONE metaphor produced for ONE specific content tension.

**Layer:** 5 (proof — shows what's POSSIBLE, not what's MANDATORY)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: These Are NOT Templates

**Every case study begins with this warning:**

> **THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE — IT IS A CASE STUDY**
>
> This document shows what ONE metaphor produced for ONE specific content. Pattern-matching to this output defeats the purpose of tension-derived composition.

**Your assignment:** Extract the PROCESS (how tension → metaphor → layout), NOT the ANSWER (geological → 6 layers → this CSS).

### Anti-Prescription Template

**File:** `ANTI-PRESCRIPTION-TEMPLATE.md`

**Sections:**
1. NOT A TEMPLATE Warning
2. Purpose Statement (what this case study documents)
3. Content Analyzed (what content properties drove this)
4. The Search in Action (tension narrative, NOT criteria)
5. What YOU Extract (mechanisms, NOT patterns)
6. Divergence Assignment (if your metaphor matches, justify)

**Use this template for all new case studies.**

## How to Use This Directory

### The Jazz Real Book Analogy

**Charlie Parker learned 200+ standards, transcribed 100+ solos, practiced 15 hours a day.**

**He did NOT play those standards verbatim in performance.**

**He EXTRACTED harmonic patterns, rhythmic devices, melodic shapes—then applied them to NEW material.**

**Your assignment:** Same approach.
- Learn these metaphors (study the process)
- Extract the mechanisms (border-weight, compression, 2-zone DNA)
- Apply to YOUR content with YOUR metaphor

**"Play what YOU hear."** — The library is your Real Book. Your composition is your solo.

---

### Reading Order (CRITICAL)

**❌ WRONG ORDER:**
1. Read case studies FIRST
2. Find one that looks similar to your content
3. Copy CSS and adapt colors

**Result:** Pattern-matching. You learned WHAT (geological has 6 layers) not HOW (tension → metaphor derivation).

**✅ CORRECT ORDER:**
1. Do YOUR tension analysis (Phases 1–3)
2. Derive YOUR metaphor independently (Phase 3)
3. Commit to YOUR metaphor (Phase 3.5 gate)
4. THEN read 2–3 similar case studies (Phase 5)
5. Extract MECHANISMS (border-weight, 2-zone DNA)
6. Apply mechanisms to YOUR metaphor

**Result:** Independent derivation. You learned HOW (tension analysis → metaphor collapse) not WHAT (copy geological).

---

### Phase 5: Divergence Verification

**After Phase 4 (implementation), you may NOW consult case studies.**

**Step 1: Scan `_INDEX.md` (titles + tension summaries only)**

**Missing:** `_INDEX.md` not yet created (HIGH priority — see anti-gravity audit).

**Workaround:** Scan case study filenames + read Section 2 (Purpose) of 2–3 relevant files.

**Step 2: Select 2–3 case studies with SIMILAR tensions**
- Similar axis (FEEL/UNDERSTAND/BECOME)
- Similar tension type (warmth/austerity, complexity/clarity, confidence/exploration)

**DO NOT read all case studies.** (Volume control — prevents pattern-matching.)

**Step 3: Read divergence assignment (Section 6)**

**If your metaphor appears in library:**
- Answer 5-question divergence table
- Justify independent convergence OR regenerate

**Example divergence questions:**
1. Did I complete Phase 1–2 WITHOUT reading library? YES/NO
2. Did content analysis INDEPENDENTLY lead to this domain? YES/NO
3. Can I trace derivation path (tension → query → domain)? YES/NO
4. Is the content tension IDENTICAL to the case study's tension? YES/NO
5. Do I have different structural isomorphisms than the case study? YES/NO

**Passing criteria:** ALL answers must favor independent convergence.

**If justification fails:** Regenerate metaphor with explicit constraint: "Geological is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"

## What to Extract (Mechanisms, NOT Patterns)

### From DD-006 Fractal

**❌ DO NOT extract:**
- "Use 4 scales"
- "80px → 48px → 32px → 20px spacing"
- "Section → subsection → detail → micro structure"

**✅ DO extract:**
- Fractal self-similarity principle (same rhythm at every scale)
- Spacing compression mechanism (dense = less padding)
- Recursive 2-zone DNA (callout inside callout)

**How to adapt:**
- YOUR metaphor: Manuscript chapters
- YOUR structure: 3 scales (chapter/section/paragraph), not 4
- YOUR spacing: 64px → 32px → 16px, not DD-006's values
- Mechanism transfers, specific values don't

---

### From OD-004 Confidence

**❌ DO NOT extract:**
- "Use geological metaphor"
- "6 strata (bedrock/strata/topsoil/atmosphere)"
- "4px certain, 3px moderate, 2px exploratory, 1px speculative"

**✅ DO extract:**
- Border-weight gradient mechanism (4px/3px/1px encodes hierarchy)
- Zone progression principle (background alternation)
- Vertical stacking pattern (sections stack, not grid)

**How to adapt:**
- YOUR metaphor: Architectural floors (basement/ground/upper)
- YOUR encoding: 4px foundation, 3px structure, 1px facade
- Mechanism transfers, metaphor doesn't

---

### From CD-006 Pilot Migration

**❌ DO NOT extract:**
- "Use meta-tutorial structure"
- "Bento grid for high-density sections"
- "5-segment density meter"

**✅ DO extract:**
- Bento grid mechanism (2-col high-density containment)
- Density meter visualization (segment bar for progression)
- Section zones (density arc containers with variable padding)

**How to adapt:**
- YOUR metaphor: Workshop stages (prep/build/refine)
- YOUR density: 3 stages, not 5
- YOUR bento: 3-column grid, not 2
- Mechanism transfers, specific implementation doesn't

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ **DO NOT use case studies as templates**
- "My content is like geological" → copy 6-strata CSS ✗
- Extract mechanism, apply to YOUR metaphor ✓

❌ **DO NOT read case studies before Phase 4**
- Early reading creates anchoring (pattern-matching risk)
- Wait until AFTER you've committed to your metaphor

❌ **DO NOT pattern-match to metaphors**
- "Geological worked for confidence → I'll use it for my hierarchy content" ✗
- Derive YOUR metaphor from YOUR tension ✓

❌ **DO NOT treat specific values as mandatory**
- "DD-006 uses 80px → 48px → 32px, so I must too" ✗
- Use spacing scale (4px increments), derive YOUR values ✓

❌ **DO NOT skip divergence verification**
- If your metaphor = library metaphor, justify OR regenerate
- Independent convergence requires STRONG evidence

## Relationship to Other Layers

**Layer 1 (Identity):**
- All case studies comply with soul constraints (0 violations)
- Metaphors work WITHIN sharp edges + flat surfaces

**Layer 2 (Vocabulary):**
- Case studies use token variables (not hardcoded values)
- Specific colors documented as EXAMPLES (amber for essence), not mandates

**Layer 3 (Grammar):**
- Case studies demonstrate mechanisms (border-weight, 2-zone DNA)
- Tension narratives show HOW mechanisms were applied

**Layer 4 (Components):**
- Case studies compose components (callout + code block + header)
- Show USAGE patterns, not just component definitions

**Layer 6 (Guidelines):**
- Semantic rules derived from case study patterns
- "When Info vs Context?" informed by OD case studies

---

## Why This Layer Exists

**Case studies are PROOF, not prescription.**

**Without case studies:**
- Mechanisms are abstract (agents don't see how they work)
- No examples of tension → metaphor process
- Agents copy from memory (training distribution patterns)

**With case studies:**
- Concrete proof of what's possible
- Tension narratives show derivation process
- Anti-prescription headers prevent template-matching

**Case studies enable learning without constraint.**

---

## Anti-Gravity Mechanisms in This Layer

**M3: Anti-Prescription Headers** ✅
- Every case study: "⚠️ THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE"
- Positions framing (proof, not recipe)

**M6: Divergence Mandate** ⚠️ (PARTIAL)
- Section 6 in template: Divergence assignment
- Skill Phase 5: "If metaphor matches, justify OR regenerate"

**M8: 3-Example Sampling** ⚠️ (PARTIAL)
- Skill: "Read 2–3 SIMILAR case studies"
- Missing: `_INDEX.md` for effective sampling

**M12: Jazz Framing** ⚠️ (PARTIAL)
- Principle present: "Extract process, not answer"
- Missing: Explicit Charlie Parker Real Book metaphor

**Next improvements:**
1. Create `_INDEX.md` (case study titles + tension summaries)
2. Add explicit jazz framing to this README
3. Verify Section 6 (divergence) present in ALL case studies

---

## File Metadata

**Case study layer files:** 13 (9 text + 3 visual + 1 template)
**Metaphor families:** 9 unique (geological, fractal, conversational, etc.)
**Axes represented:** All 3 (FEEL, UNDERSTAND, BECOME)
**Soul compliance:** 100% (0 violations across all case studies)
**Anti-prescription enforcement:** Template + Section 1 warnings + Section 6 divergence
**Extraction lens:** Visual-first (case studies are about EXPERIENCE)
**Validation:** Anti-gravity audit (94.7% compliance, M6 partial)
**Next review:** After Phase D-V builds (add new metaphors, track pattern fatigue)

---

## Why BOTH Grammar and Case Studies?

**The Architectural Question:** If mechanisms (grammar/) are extracted FROM case studies, why keep both layers?

**Short Answer:** Grammar = TOOLS you use. Case Studies = USAGE examples you learn from. Jazz musicians need BOTH chord voicings (tools) AND transcribed solos (usage examples).

---

### The Two-Layer Architecture

**Layer 3 (Grammar - mechanism-catalog.md):**
- **Content:** 18 transferable CSS TECHNIQUES
- **Abstraction level:** Mechanism divorced from metaphor
- **Test applied:** Name Test (remove metaphor, still makes sense?)
- **Example:** "Border-weight gradient encodes hierarchy: 4px/3px/2px/1px"
- **Purpose:** VOCABULARY — what mechanisms exist, what they encode (abstract)

**Layer 5 (Case Studies - this directory):**
- **Content:** 9 complete implementations in specific metaphors
- **Abstraction level:** Mechanism + metaphor + context + process
- **Test applied:** Divergence (is this implementation unique or copied?)
- **Example:** "Geological metaphor uses 4px bedrock (established knowledge = consolidated, heavy) vs 1px surface (speculative = loose, fragile)"
- **Purpose:** USAGE PROOF — how mechanisms were applied to THIS content with THIS metaphor

---

### What Happens With Only Grammar?

**WITHOUT case studies, builders would:**
- ✓ Know mechanisms exist (border-weight gradient, spacing compression)
- ✓ Know mechanisms transfer (work across metaphors)
- ✗ NOT know how mechanisms LOOK in practice (what does "spacing compression" actually mean visually?)
- ✗ NOT see how mechanisms COMBINE (border-weight + spacing + backgrounds can encode the SAME semantic together)
- ✗ NOT understand WHEN mechanisms fit (geological metaphor supports compression, musical metaphor doesn't)
- ✗ NOT see the PROCESS (how tension → metaphor → mechanism selection actually unfolds)

**Result:** Abstract vocabulary with no usage context → builders copy from TRAINING DISTRIBUTION (generic blog layouts) instead of compositional-core grammar.

---

### What Happens With Only Case Studies?

**WITHOUT mechanism catalog, builders would:**
- ✓ See complete implementations (OD-004 geological stratification)
- ✓ Understand context (why geological metaphor for API confidence)
- ✗ NOT know what's TRANSFERABLE (is "4px bedrock border" the mechanism or is "border-weight gradient" the mechanism?)
- ✗ NOT separate METAPHOR (geological) from MECHANISM (border-weight encoding)
- ✗ NOT abstract PATTERNS (geological compression is a specific instance of spacing compression)

**Result:** Case studies treated as TEMPLATES → builders copy geological vocabulary (`.stratum` classes) because they can't separate metaphor from mechanism.

---

### How the Two Layers Work Together

**The Intended Workflow:**

**Phase 0-3:** Derive YOUR metaphor (NO library access)
- Grammar: Not yet consulted
- Case Studies: PROHIBITED (anti-gravity R1)

**Phase 4:** Extract mechanisms for YOUR metaphor
- **Read:** mechanism-catalog.md (FIRST)
- **Apply Name Test:** Remove metaphor, does mechanism still make sense?
- **Example:** "Border-weight gradient" (abstracted) vs "4px bedrock" (metaphor-specific)
- **Select:** 8-10 mechanisms that serve YOUR content needs
- **Apply:** Mechanisms to YOUR metaphor with YOUR values

**Phase 5:** Verify divergence (OPTIONAL but recommended)
- **Read:** 2-3 case studies most similar to YOUR metaphor
- **Purpose:** NOT to get ideas (metaphor is locked), but to verify you're not copying
- **Compare:** YOUR mechanism APPLICATION vs showcase MECHANISM APPLICATION
- **Check:** Different values? Different combinations? Different spatial logic?

**Phase 6:** Build using mechanisms as VOCABULARY
- Exact token values (var(--space-8))
- Mechanisms adapted to YOUR metaphor
- YOUR vocabulary (not library class names)

---

### The Abstraction Relationship

**Case Studies → Grammar extraction:**

```
SHOWCASE PAGE (OD-004)
├─ Metaphor: Geological stratification (bedrock/topsoil)
├─ CSS: .stratum--bedrock { border-left: 4px; padding: 40px; }
├─ Semantic: Established knowledge = consolidated = heavy = sparse
└─ Context: API confidence documentation

     ↓ Name Test + Transfer Test applied

MECHANISM CATALOG
├─ Mechanism: Border-Weight Gradient
├─ CSS Pattern: 4px/3px/2px/1px encoding
├─ Semantic Domain: Hierarchy / Importance / Confidence (ABSTRACT)
├─ Transfers to: ANY content with hierarchical structure
└─ Metaphor-independent: Works for geological, architectural, botanical, etc.
```

**Grammar → Builder application:**

```
MECHANISM CATALOG
└─ Mechanism: Border-Weight Gradient (4px/3px/2px/1px)

     ↓ Builder applies to THEIR metaphor

YOUR PAGE (Architectural floors metaphor)
├─ Metaphor: Building structure (basement/ground/roofline)
├─ CSS: .floor--basement { border-left: 4px; padding: 48px; }
├─ Semantic: Foundation load-bearing = heavy = structural certainty
└─ Context: Infrastructure architecture guide
```

**Key Property:** Builder used the SAME mechanism (#1 border-weight gradient) but with DIFFERENT metaphor, DIFFERENT values, DIFFERENT class names. SAME vocabulary, DIFFERENT sentence. This is grammar fluency, not template copying.

---

### Why NOT Merge the Layers?

**Option considered:** Merge mechanism definitions + usage examples into single file.

**Rejected because:**

1. **Anti-gravity protection:** Separating grammar (early access, Phase 4) from case studies (late access, Phase 5) prevents pre-creative anchoring. If merged, builders would see implementations WHILE reading mechanisms → pattern-matching.

2. **Cognitive load:** Mechanism catalog is 869 lines (already dense). Adding 9 case studies = 3,500+ lines. Builders need concise reference, not tome.

3. **Abstraction clarity:** Grammar layer documents WHAT transfers (mechanism). Case study layer documents WHAT doesn't transfer (metaphor). Keeping them separate reinforces the distinction.

4. **Usage sequence:** Builders need mechanisms FIRST (Phase 4), case studies SECOND (Phase 5, optional). Merged file doesn't enforce sequence.

### The Jazz Real Book Analogy (Applied)

**Jazz Real Book = Case Studies Layer:**
- Contains 200+ standards (complete songs with melody, chords, form)
- Musicians study these to learn CONTEXT (when ii-V-I appears, how melody shapes over changes)
- Purpose: See vocabulary IN USE

**Jazz Theory Book = Grammar Layer:**
- Contains chord voicings, scales, patterns (ii-V-I, tritone substitution)
- Musicians study these to learn VOCABULARY (what harmonic tools exist)
- Purpose: Build vocabulary INVENTORY

**Jazz musicians use BOTH:**
- Theory book: Learn ii-V-I progression exists, see notation
- Real Book: Hear ii-V-I in "Autumn Leaves," see how melody navigates the changes
- Application: Use ii-V-I in ORIGINAL compositions (not playing "Autumn Leaves" verbatim)

**KortAI builders use BOTH:**
- Grammar: Learn border-weight gradient exists, see CSS pattern
- Case Studies: See border-weight in OD-004 geological context, understand how it encoded confidence
- Application: Use border-weight in YOUR page with YOUR metaphor (not copying geological strata)

---

**SUMMARY:**

Grammar (Layer 3) extracts the TRANSFERABLE (mechanisms).
Case Studies (Layer 5) preserve the SITUATED (metaphor + context).

Both layers are necessary:
- Grammar alone = vocabulary without usage context → builders can't see what mechanisms LOOK like
- Case Studies alone = examples without abstraction → builders can't separate transferable from specific

Together, they enable **vocabulary fluency** (knowing tools) + **usage wisdom** (knowing when tools fit).

---

**LEARN THE PROCESS. NOT THE ANSWER.**

# Prohibitions — Identity-Bearing Negative Rules

**Lens Statement:** I am using Identity + Enablement hybrid lens. This prioritizes soul preservation and creative freedom over frequency and completeness.

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Extractor:** prohibition-extractor (agent)
**Purpose:** Extract identity-bearing prohibitions that define KortAI by what it REFUSES

---

## What This Document IS

These prohibitions define KortAI identity through CONSTRAINTS. Each uses NEVER/ALWAYS language because binary rules achieve 100% agent compliance (metacognition finding from MEMORY.md).

These are NOT recommendations. They are IDENTITY-LEVEL BOUNDARIES.

---

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (No Exceptions, EVER)

These define KortAI by what it REFUSES. They protect the ANTI-PHYSICAL editorial identity.

### 1. NEVER Use border-radius > 0 on Any Element

**Why it exists:** Sharp edges = decisive, confident, print heritage. Rounded corners = friendly, safe, generic. This is THE #1 soul constraint. Sharp geometry IS KortAI identity.

**What it protects:** Visual soul (anti-physical aesthetic), geometric precision, editorial authority

**Evidence:**
- `geometry.md` lines 31-32: "border-radius: 0 on EVERYTHING (LOCKED, NO EXCEPTIONS) — Sharp edges = decisive, confident; rounded = generic. This is the #1 soul constraint"
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 59-72: "Could be any UI kit... sharp edges = decisive, confident"
- AD validation: "border-radius: 0 was verified as GENERATIVE, not merely restrictive — the angular spiral in AD-004 exists BECAUSE of this constraint (AD-F-013)"
- Identity-lens.md line 30: "border-radius: 0 EVERYWHERE — Zero rounded corners, always"

---

### 2. NEVER Use box-shadow on Any Element

**Why it exists:** Shadows create false depth through physical light metaphors. KortAI achieves depth through spacing, borders, and background zones. Flat = print heritage, honest.

**What it protects:** Anti-physical identity, flat design principle, honest representation

**Evidence:**
- `geometry.md` lines 88-95: "box-shadow: none on EVERYTHING. No exceptions. Why? Shadows = fake 3D, dishonest. Flat = print heritage, honest."
- AD validation: "AD-005 (Choreography) produced the strongest evidence via ANTI-PHYSICAL identity (AD-F-020): 20 CONDITIONAL PASS R-4 findings required reinterpretation from 'visual movement' to 'structural movement.' Any technique implying physical object behavior (including shadows) fails the soul test."
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 76-89: "Fake 3D, dishonest, breaks flat design principle"
- Identity-lens.md line 31: "box-shadow: none EVERYWHERE — No shadows, no depth illusion"

---

### 3. NEVER Use filter: drop-shadow() on Any Element

**Why it exists:** Same principle as box-shadow — physical reality metaphors (light casting shadows) contradict KortAI's abstract precision. Any shadow effect violates anti-physical identity.

**What it protects:** Anti-physical identity, flat aesthetic consistency

**Evidence:**
- `geometry.md` line 151: "Drop shadow: NEVER"
- Identity-lens.md line 32: "filter: drop-shadow() FORBIDDEN — No shadow effects"
- Soul-constraints.md: "filter: none (no drop-shadow) — WHY: Same principle as box-shadow — physical reality metaphors (light casting shadows) contradict KortAI's abstract precision."

---

### 4. NEVER Use Semi-Transparent Backgrounds (opacity < 1 on Visual Elements)

**Why it exists:** Any opacity < 1.0 on offset pseudo-elements or backgrounds creates the same visual effect as box-shadow — a depth illusion that violates the ANTI-PHYSICAL identity. Embedded rgba backgrounds survive multiple review layers but are soul violations.

**What it protects:** Anti-physical identity, flat depth encoding

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 329-354: "OD-AP-003: Semi-Transparent Backgrounds (Systemic Audit Gap) — Found in EVERY wave of re-enrichment... opacity < 1.0 on offset pseudo-elements creates the same visual effect as box-shadow... Binary rule: opacity === 1.0 on all visual elements. No exceptions."
- Identity-lens.md line 33: "opacity: 1 on all backgrounds — No transparency tricks"
- Re-enrichment finding: "rgba(0,0,0,0.04) on callout inline code and troubleshoot inline code" found in multiple waves

---

### 5. NEVER Use Gradient Backgrounds (linear-gradient, radial-gradient, etc.)

**Why it exists:** Gradients imply light sources, dimensional depth, or decorative complexity. All contradict flat editorial identity.

**What it protects:** Flat color principle, anti-complexity, honest representation

**Evidence:**
- Identity-lens.md line 282: "Gradient backgrounds — Violates flat color principle"
- Anti-patterns registry concept: "Decorative effects" category includes gradients as neumorphism/glassmorphism violations
- Enablement-lens.md: Flat backgrounds only (implied from all examples)

---

### 6. NEVER Use Pure Black (#000000) or Pure White (#FFFFFF)

**Why it exists:** KortAI uses warm earth tones. Pure black = harsh, digital. Pure white = sterile, clinical. The warm cream background (#FEF9F5) and soft black text (#1A1A1A) create the distinctive editorial warmth.

**What it protects:** Warm palette identity, editorial tone, visual warmth

**Evidence:**
- `geometry.md` implied (use palette values only)
- Identity-lens.md line 53: "Soft black (never pure #000)" and line 283: "Pure black (#000) or pure white (#FFF) — Violates warm palette"
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 113-124: "Gray Backgrounds — What: background: #F5F5F5 or similar cool grays. Why it fails: Sterile, institutional, not editorial. Alternative: Warm cream (#FEF9F5)"
- Lens-manifesto.md line 266: "No pure black (#000) or pure white (#FFF)"

---

### 7. NEVER Use Instrument Serif for Body Text

**Why it exists:** Instrument Serif is DISPLAY ONLY (headings, titles). Using it for body text destroys the typography trinity and makes long-form reading difficult. Inter is body font.

**What it protects:** Typography hierarchy, readability, editorial voice

**Evidence:**
- `geometry.md` (implied from typography trinity structure)
- Identity-lens.md lines 71-79: "Typography Trinity... Instrument Serif on H1s gives the distinctive 'literary documentation' feel. Inter for body creates clean readability."
- Lens-manifesto.md line 265: "Serif NOT for body text (only display headings)"
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 172-188: "Sans-Serif for Essence Body... Using Inter for Essence Callout body text... Loses reverent, archival quality. Alternative: Instrument Serif italic [FOR ESSENCE ONLY, not general body text]"

---

### 8. NEVER Use Rounded Corners for Decoration (Redundant Reinforcement of #1)

**Why it exists:** This prohibition has distinct intent from #1 — this is about COSMETIC SOFTENING vs geometric precision. Rounding corners to "make things friendly" is a design philosophy KortAI explicitly rejects.

**What it protects:** Angular identity, anti-friendly-design philosophy, decisiveness

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 59-62: "Signals 'safe/generic' — could be any UI kit. Alternative: border-radius: 0 — sharp edges = decisive, confident"
- Identity-lens.md line 280: "Rounded corners (border-radius > 0) — INSTANTLY breaks anti-physical identity"
- Lens-manifesto.md cosmetic vs structural distinction (implied)

---

## CONDITIONAL PROHIBITIONS (Documented Exceptions ONLY)

These have SPECIFIC, DOCUMENTED contexts where they DO NOT apply. Outside those contexts, they are prohibited.

### 9. NEVER Use 2px Borders (EXCEPT for Confidence Encoding in OD-004 Pattern)

**Why it exists:** 2px borders are structurally ambiguous — too thin to be architectural signal (like 4px callout border), too thick to be subtle separator (like 1px divider). Creates "neither here nor there" visual weakness.

**Exception:** OD-004 uses 2px borders as part of confidence-encoding system (specific, documented pattern).

**What it protects:** Visual hierarchy clarity, structural border weights

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 282-307: "OD-F-AP-001: 2px Border Epidemic — 108 CSS declarations, 1000+ computed instances... too thin to be a strong architectural signal (like the 4px callout left-border), too thick to be a subtle separator (like 1px dividers)"
- `geometry.md` line 120: "The 2px width is deliberately skipped to avoid the 2px epidemic anti-pattern (OD-F-AP-001)"
- Identity-lens.md line 42: "NO 2px BORDERS ever — Forbidden epidemic value"
- OD granular audit: "#1 systemic issue identified"

**Exception documentation:** If using 2px borders, you MUST document: "Using 2px border for [specific confidence encoding pattern from OD-004]. Exception justified by [pattern reference]."

---

### 10. NEVER Use Accent Borders < 4px (EXCEPT for Progressive Depth Encoding)

**Why it exists:** The 4px left-border is KortAI's signature accent. Too subtle (1-2px) doesn't register as intentional. 3px is minimum for structural borders, 4px is standard for callout accents.

**Exception:** AD-004 (Spiral) uses progressive border-weight gradient (4px/3px/1px) for geological depth encoding. This is ONE documented context where progressive widths are semantic.

**What it protects:** Signature callout accent, visual intentionality, hierarchy clarity

**Evidence:**
- `geometry.md` lines 109-121: "Left Accent Border (Callouts) — 4px minimum. Never 1-2px (too subtle)... AD-004 (Spiral) uses a progressive border-weight gradient (4px/3px/1px) for geological depth encoding (AD-F-014). This is the ONE context where progressive border widths are semantic."
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 190-203: "Thin Callout Borders — What: border-left: 1px or 2px. Why it fails: Too subtle, doesn't create visual anchor. Alternative: 4px minimum"
- Identity-lens.md lines 41-47: "4px left-border is KortAI's signature accent"

**Exception documentation:** If using borders < 4px, you MUST document: "Using border-weight gradient [4px/3px/1px] for depth encoding per AD-F-014. Exception justified by [geological stratification pattern]."

---

### 11. NEVER Use Decorative Elements That Do Not Carry Information

**Why it exists:** KortAI follows anti-complexity principle and perceptual depth principle. Every visual element must carry semantic weight. Decoration for decoration's sake is rejected.

**Exception:** NONE documented. If an element doesn't carry information, delete it.

**What it protects:** Anti-complexity principle, information density, semantic design

**Evidence:**
- Identity-lens.md lines 133-139: "Anti-Complexity Principle... This principle is ENCODED IN THE CSS. The soul constraints (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none) are the CSS manifestation of anti-complexity. No gradients, no transforms, no animations (except subtle scroll reveals). The visual language rejects decorative complexity."
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` line 269: "neumorphism, glassmorphism, or decorative effects"
- Lens-manifesto.md line 268: "No neumorphism, glassmorphism, or decorative effects"
- Enablement-lens.md principle: "Information density over decoration"

---

### 12. NEVER Break Grid with Decoration (Content-Only Grid Breaking Permitted)

**Why it exists:** Breaking grid structure must serve CONTENT HIERARCHY, not visual playfulness. Decorative grid breaks violate flat design and anti-complexity.

**Exception:** Content-driven asymmetry (e.g., pull quotes, emphasis callouts) where the break serves semantic purpose.

**What it protects:** Flat design, content hierarchy, structural integrity

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 163-167: "Decorative Grid Breaking — What: Breaking grid with decorative elements. Why it fails: Violates flat design — decoration competes with content. Alternative: Break with CONTENT, not decoration"
- Identity-lens.md line 299: "Floating action buttons — Breaks flat hierarchy"
- Structural identity concept: page anatomy consistency

---

### 13. NEVER Use Vertical Borders in Tables

**Why it exists:** Vertical lines create "prison bars effect" — claustrophobic, heavy. Open grid with horizontal rules only creates breathing room and cleaner data presentation.

**Exception:** NONE documented. Always use horizontal-only borders in tables.

**What it protects:** Open grid aesthetic, readability, breathing room

**Evidence:**
- `geometry.md` lines 130-138: "No Vertical Borders in Tables — Why? Vertical lines = prison bars. Open grid = breathing room."
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 241-258: "Vertical Table Borders — What: Cell borders on left/right of table columns. Why it fails: Prison bars effect, claustrophobic. Alternative: Open grid — horizontal rules only, whitespace for columns"
- Enablement-lens.md line 80: "Table open-grid pattern (no vertical borders, horizontal-only, semantic header row)"

---

### 14. NEVER Use Hover Lift Effects (transform: translateY)

**Why it exists:** Hover lift treats content like interactive buttons, creating fake 3D movement. Violates anti-physical identity and flat content principle.

**Exception:** NONE documented. Content is editorial, not interactive element.

**What it protects:** Anti-physical identity, flat interaction model, content vs UI distinction

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 229-237: "Hover Lift Effects — What: transform: translateY(-4px) on hover. Why it fails: Treats content like buttons, fake 3D. Alternative: No transform — content, not interactive element. AD Forward Reference: [AD-F-020] — AD-005 (Choreography) clarified: 'movement' in this system means choreography of READER's attention through static content structure, not CSS animation."
- Identity-lens.md line 295: "Floating action buttons — Breaks flat hierarchy"
- AD-F-020: "20 R-4 findings required reinterpretation from 'visual movement' to 'structural movement.' 8 SOUL FAIL findings explicitly document the boundary."

---

### 15. NEVER Use Traffic-Light Color Adjacency (Green Next to Red)

**Why it exists:** Green (#4A9D6B) adjacent to red (#E83025) creates kindergarten-level visual language, diminishes both colors' authority.

**Exception:** Separate with whitespace (48px+ spacing) or neutral component between them.

**What it protects:** Color authority, visual maturity, palette sophistication

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 94-109: "Traffic-Light Colors — What: Green (#4A9D6B) adjacent to red (#E83025). Why it fails: Kindergarten-level visual language, diminishes both. Alternative: Separate with whitespace or neutral component"
- Visual break prohibition category (identity-lens.md)

**Exception documentation:** If using green and red on same page, you MUST document: "Tip callout and Gotcha callout separated by [48px spacing / neutral content component]. Exception justified by sufficient visual separation."

---

### 16. NEVER Use Cool-Toned Grays (#F5F5F5, #E0E0E0, etc.)

**Why it exists:** Cool grays = sterile, institutional. KortAI uses warm earth tones. Background must be warm cream (#FEF9F5), borders warm tan (#E0D5C5).

**Exception:** NONE documented. Always use warm palette values.

**What it protects:** Warm palette identity, editorial tone, color temperature consistency

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 113-124: "Gray Backgrounds — What: background: #F5F5F5 or similar cool grays. Why it fails: Sterile, institutional, not editorial. Alternative: Warm cream (#FEF9F5) or semantic tints"
- Identity-lens.md line 285: "Cool-toned grays — Violates warm palette"
- Lens-manifesto.md principle: warm editorial identity

---

### 17. NEVER Use Non-Italic h3 Headings

**Why it exists:** Editorial hierarchy convention requires all h3 to be italic. This creates the distinctive KortAI typographic rhythm.

**Exception:** NONE documented. All h3 must be italic.

**What it protects:** Editorial hierarchy, typography rhythm, voice consistency

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 207-219: "Non-Italic h3 — What: h3 with normal font-style. Why it fails: Breaks editorial hierarchy convention. Alternative: All h3 should be italic"
- Typography conventions (identity-lens.md)

---

### 18. NEVER Use Same-Density Stacking (SLOW + SLOW or FAST + FAST Adjacent)

**Why it exists:** Monotonous density creates no rhythm, no rest points. KortAI requires fractal density rhythm — dense/sparse alternation at multiple scales.

**Exception:** Intentional crescendo patterns (PULSE, CRESCENDO) where density BUILDS toward climax.

**What it protects:** Fractal density rhythm, reading experience, perceptual depth

**Evidence:**
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 155-161: "Same Density Throughout — What: Uniform spacing/density from top to bottom. Why it fails: Monotonous, no rhythm, no rest points. Alternative: Use PULSE, CRESCENDO, BOOKENDS, or WAVE patterns"
- `anti-patterns/registry.md` lines 261-266: "Same-Velocity Stacking — What: SLOW + SLOW or FAST + FAST components adjacent. Why it fails: Monotonous, no rhythm. Alternative: Vary velocity (SLOW → FAST → SLOW)"
- Identity-lens.md lines 116-126: "Density Layering (Fractal Self-Similarity) — The same dense/sparse rhythm at multiple scales"

**Exception documentation:** If using same-density stacking, you MUST document: "Using [CRESCENDO / PULSE] pattern from [source]. Exception justified by intentional density arc from [sparse → dense → resolution]."

---

## Meta-Prohibitions (Process-Level)

These protect the DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, not just visual outcomes.

### 19. NEVER Justify Design Choices Without Research Provenance

**Why it exists:** Every visual decision must trace to research findings. Arbitrary choices break the provenance chain and undermine the research-first methodology.

**What it protects:** Research-first principle, provenance integrity, design rigor

**Evidence:**
- Identity-lens.md lines 141-147: "Research-First Methodology... Every visual decision is grounded in research findings (R1-R5). Every pattern is validated through explorations (DD, OD, CD, AD). Nothing is arbitrary... This creates the 'intentional design' feel."
- CLAUDE.md MANDATORY RESEARCH GROUNDING section
- Lens-manifesto.md: "Document provenance" principle

---

### 20. NEVER Create New Patterns Without Tension Derivation

**Why it exists:** Patterns emerge from content tension resolution, not template reuse. Creating patterns without tension analysis creates pattern-matching instead of genuine metaphor derivation.

**What it protects:** Creative freedom, metaphor authenticity, anti-gravity mechanisms

**Evidence:**
- Rigidity-mechanics.md lines 915-920: "YES — if patterns are framed as templates and available during generation. NO — if patterns are framed as proof-of-concept and unavailable during derivation."
- Tension-composition skill: Phase 1-3 must happen BEFORE pattern consultation
- Lens-manifesto.md M6: "Explicit Divergence Mandate"

# Tension-Composition Skill Enrichments — Anti-Gravity Additions

**Purpose:** Draft additions for `/Users/spacewizardmoneygang/.claude/skills/tension-composition/SKILL.md`
**Source Research:** rigidity-mechanics/08-synthesis.md + extraction-epistemology/09-synthesis.md
**Principle:** Binary rules only. No judgment language. Exact insertion points specified.

---

## ADDITION 1: Anti-Assumption Header (TOP OF FILE)

**INSERT LOCATION:** After line 4 (after `---` following the YAML frontmatter), BEFORE line 5 (before `# Tension-Composition Pipeline`)

**EXACT CONTEXT:**
```markdown
---

# Tension-Composition Pipeline
```

**INSERTION:**

```markdown
---

⚠️ **CRITICAL PRINCIPLE — READ THIS FIRST**

**You are CONSTRUCTING a composition, not DISCOVERING one.**

Your lens shapes what you see. The categories you bring (warmth, hierarchy, progression) determine what patterns emerge. The metaphor you choose is a CREATIVE ACT, not an inevitable conclusion.

**What this means:**
- Multiple valid metaphors exist for the SAME content
- Your derivation is ONE PATH, not THE PATH
- The tension you identify is CONSTRUCTED through your questioning
- The metaphor you select is CHOSEN, not found

**The opposite of this (discovery bias):**
- "The content IS geological" — NO, you are READING it as geological
- "This metaphor is THE answer" — NO, this metaphor is A bridge you built
- "The tension demands this resolution" — NO, you chose to resolve it this way

**Success = conscious construction. Failure = unconscious pattern-matching.**

---

# Tension-Composition Pipeline
```

**RATIONALE:** Positions construction-awareness at entry point. Prevents "discovery bias" from line 1.

---

## ADDITION 2: Phase 0A — Library Prohibition (BEFORE PHASE 1)

**INSERT LOCATION:** After line 45 (after `---` following Phase 0 Step 0C), BEFORE line 46 (before `---` and Phase 1 heading)

**EXACT CONTEXT:**
```markdown
3. Flag sections with incompatible structural needs (these may need section-level metaphor variation in Phase 4)

---

## Phase 1: Multi-Axis Questioning
```

**INSERTION:**

```markdown
3. Flag sections with incompatible structural needs (these may need section-level metaphor variation in Phase 4)

---

### Step 0D: Library Access Prohibition (CRITICAL)

**YOU MUST NOT read the following during Phases 0-3:**

- `/active/design-system/case-studies/` (pattern library)
- `/active/design-system/library/` (if exists)
- Prior compositional explorations (DD-001 through AD-006)
- Tension-test layouts (boris/, gastown/, playbook/)

**Why this prohibition exists:**

Library patterns are VALIDATION tools, not GENERATION tools. Reading them before metaphor commitment = pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.

**When library access is permitted:**

- Phase 4: Read `/techniques/mechanisms.md` ONLY (reusable techniques)
- Phase 5: Read `/case-studies/` (2-3 MOST similar, for divergence verification)

**Violation of this rule invalidates the entire derivation.**

You will be building from content tension and domain knowledge, NOT from library templates. The library exists to verify your metaphor is novel, not to provide your metaphor.

---

## Phase 1: Multi-Axis Questioning
```

**RATIONALE:** Binary prohibition (MUST NOT) enforced at earliest possible point. Timing control = master anti-gravity mechanism (M1, M5).

---

## ADDITION 3: Phase 3.5 — Metaphor Commitment Gate (NEW PHASE)

**INSERT LOCATION:** After line 597 (after Cultural Consideration section ending), BEFORE line 598 (before `---` and Phase 4 heading)

**EXACT CONTEXT:**
```markdown
- For global audiences: "Would this metaphor make sense to someone who has never encountered [cultural practice]?"

---

## Phase 4: Compositional Layout Generation
```

**INSERTION:**

```markdown
- For global audiences: "Would this metaphor make sense to someone who has never encountered [cultural practice]?"

---

## Phase 3.5: Metaphor Commitment (LOCK-IN GATE)

**BEFORE proceeding to Phase 4, you MUST complete this gate.**

### Step 3.5A: State Your Committed Metaphor

**Your metaphor:** _______________________________________________

**Write it down. This is your LOCKED-IN metaphor. You DO NOT change it after consulting the library.**

### Step 3.5B: Document WHY This Metaphor

**How it resolves the tension (specific):**

[Explain: What property of THIS metaphor resolves THIS tension? Be concrete.]

**Why this metaphor vs alternatives (specific):**

[What alternatives did you consider? Why did you reject them? What makes this metaphor BETTER for THIS content?]

### Step 3.5C: Commitment Verification

**Answer these questions:**

1. **Did I derive this metaphor independently?** YES / NO
   - If NO: You read library patterns before commitment. RESTART Phase 1.

2. **Can I justify this metaphor without referencing library examples?** YES / NO
   - If NO: You are pattern-matching. Regenerate metaphor with explicit constraint (ban all library metaphors).

3. **Does this metaphor appear in `/case-studies/_INDEX.md`?** (DO NOT READ full case studies, only titles)
   - If YES: Proceed to divergence justification (Step 3.5D)
   - If NO: Proceed to Phase 4

### Step 3.5D: Divergence Justification (If Convergence Detected)

**If your metaphor matches a library pattern title:**

You MUST provide STRONG evidence of independent convergence.

**Convergence justification table:**

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Did I complete Phase 1-2 WITHOUT reading library? | YES / NO |
| Did content analysis INDEPENDENTLY lead to this domain? | YES / NO |
| Can I trace derivation path (tension → search query → domain)? | YES / NO |
| Is the content tension IDENTICAL to the case study's tension? | YES / NO |
| Do I have different structural isomorphisms than the case study? | YES / NO |

**Passing criteria:** ALL answers must favor independent convergence.

**If justification fails:** Regenerate metaphor with explicit constraint: "My metaphor MUST NOT be [library pattern name]. What OTHER domain resolves [tension] while satisfying [constraints]?"

**Why this gate exists:**

The library contains proven metaphors. Seeing them BEFORE derivation creates gravitational pull toward pattern-matching. This gate ensures your metaphor is YOURS, not a library reproduction.

**Phase 3.5 is complete when:**
- ✅ Metaphor committed in writing
- ✅ Justification documented
- ✅ Divergence verified (or convergence justified)

**You are now LOCKED IN. Proceed to Phase 4.**

---

## Phase 4: Compositional Layout Generation
```

**RATIONALE:** Hard gate between creative derivation (Phases 1-3) and library consultation (Phases 4-5). Prevents post-generation switching. Forces conscious divergence verification (M6, M9).

---

## ADDITION 4: Phase 4 Revision — Mechanism Extraction (REPLACE EXISTING PHASE 4.1)

**REPLACE LOCATION:** Lines 648-707 (entire Phase 4.1 "Extract Metaphor Physical Properties")

**EXACT CONTEXT TO REPLACE (first 5 lines):**
```markdown
### Step 4.1 -- Extract Metaphor Physical Properties (5-Category Taxonomy)

For any metaphor, systematically extract properties across ALL five categories:

**A. Spatial Properties** -- Where things are, how they relate in space
```

**EXACT CONTEXT TO REPLACE (last 5 lines):**
```markdown
**Completeness Checklist**: For any metaphor, ask:
1. **Spatial**: What is the physical arrangement?
2. **Temporal**: What is the time dimension?
3. **Material**: What is the substance like?
4. **Behavioral**: What does it DO?
5. **Relational**: How do parts relate?

If ANY category produces zero properties, the metaphor may be insufficiently rich.
```

**REPLACEMENT:**

```markdown
### Step 4.0 -- Mechanism Library Access (NOW PERMITTED)

**You may NOW consult:**

- `/active/design-system/techniques/mechanisms.md` (reusable techniques catalog)
- `/active/design-system/foundations/components.md` (base components)

**What to extract from mechanisms catalog:**

✅ **REUSABLE TECHNIQUES** (apply to ANY content):
- Border-weight gradient encoding
- 2-zone component DNA
- Spacing compression patterns
- Solid-offset depth technique
- Dense/sparse alternation

❌ **DO NOT extract from case studies:**
- Full layout architectures (metaphor-specific)
- Section structures (metaphor-driven)
- Metaphor vocabulary (geological, manuscript, etc.)

**Extraction protocol:**

1. **Scan mechanism catalog** — identify 3-5 techniques relevant to YOUR metaphor
2. **Extract technique, NOT implementation** — e.g., "border-weight encodes hierarchy" (technique) vs "4px/3px/1px for confidence levels" (implementation)
3. **Adapt to YOUR context** — Your metaphor + mechanism technique = new implementation

**Sample 2-4 mechanisms most relevant to YOUR metaphor. DO NOT read all mechanisms.**

**You still MUST NOT read `/case-studies/` directory. Case study access = Phase 5 ONLY.**

---

### Step 4.1 -- Extract Metaphor Physical Properties (5-Category Taxonomy)

**For YOUR COMMITTED METAPHOR, systematically extract properties across ALL five categories:**

**A. Spatial Properties** -- Where things are, how they relate in space

| Property | CSS Mechanism |
|----------|--------------|
| Horizontal layers | `flex-direction: column` + distinct background zones |
| Vertical columns | `grid-template-columns` |
| Radial/hub-spoke | Central hub + surrounding spoke containers |
| Nested containment | Bordered parent with padded children |
| Adjacency | Gap values in grid/flex |

**B. Temporal Properties** -- Sequence, rhythm, progression

| Property | CSS Mechanism |
|----------|--------------|
| Sequence/ordering | DOM order + vertical flow |
| Simultaneity/parallel | Multi-column grid |
| Progression/gradient | Progressive spacing compression + darkening backgrounds |
| Oscillation/cycles | Alternating zone backgrounds |
| Climax/crescendo | Sections with decreasing padding, increasing density |

**C. Material Properties** -- Texture, weight, substance

| Property | CSS Mechanism |
|----------|--------------|
| Density/compression | `padding`, `line-height`, `font-size`, `gap` |
| Weight/heaviness | `border-width`, `font-weight`, background opacity |
| Transparency/opacity | Background color saturation/value shifts |
| Texture | Font family shifts (serif vs sans vs mono) |

**D. Behavioral Properties** -- Movement, transformation

| Property | CSS Mechanism |
|----------|--------------|
| Descent/drilling | Vertical stacking with increasing visual weight downward |
| Expansion/contraction | Responsive breakpoints, collapsing grids |
| Oscillation/breathing | Breathing zone components between sections |
| Flow direction | Reading direction + scan patterns (F-pattern, Z-pattern) |

**E. Relational Properties** -- How parts connect

| Property | CSS Mechanism |
|----------|--------------|
| Containment | Border around parent element |
| Hierarchy | Typography scale + border weight |
| Flow/connection | Transition components between zones |
| Isolation | Gap between siblings + no shared borders |
| Bridging | Transition elements connecting two domains |

**Completeness Checklist**: For YOUR metaphor, ask:
1. **Spatial**: What is the physical arrangement?
2. **Temporal**: What is the time dimension?
3. **Material**: What is the substance like?
4. **Behavioral**: What does it DO?
5. **Relational**: How do parts relate?

**If ANY category produces zero properties, YOUR metaphor may be insufficiently rich.**

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**
- **Mechanisms** (extractable) = border-weight gradient, compression technique, 2-zone DNA
- **Implementations** (metaphor-specific) = "4px bedrock border", "80px surface padding", "6 strata"

**You extract MECHANISMS. You apply them to YOUR metaphor. You DO NOT copy implementations.**
```

**RATIONALE:** Phase 4.0 grants library access at CORRECT timing (after metaphor commitment). Explicit separation: mechanisms (reusable) vs case studies (prohibited until Phase 5). Reinforces M1, M2, M5.

---

## ADDITION 5: Phase 5 Revision — Divergence Verification (NEW PHASE)

**INSERT LOCATION:** After line 999 (after Determinism section in Edge Cases), BEFORE line 1000 (before Stale Tension section)

**EXACT CONTEXT:**
```markdown
The pipeline is deterministic in all phases EXCEPT the constrained associative search (Phase 3.4). Multiple valid metaphors may exist for the same content. This is by design -- the pipeline is a creative scaffold, not a compiler. If determinism is required, document the selected metaphor in a COMPOSITION BRIEF for future reference.

### Stale Tension (re-using a resolved tension)
```

**INSERTION:**

This is by design -- the pipeline is a creative scaffold, not a compiler. If determinism is required, document the selected metaphor in a COMPOSITION BRIEF for future reference.

---

## Phase 5: Divergence Verification (NOW ACCESS CASE STUDIES)

**After Phase 4 completion, you may NOW consult:**

- `/active/design-system/case-studies/` (pattern library)
- Read 2-3 MOST SIMILAR case studies to your committed metaphor

**Purpose of Phase 5:**

NOT to get implementation ideas (you already built in Phase 4).

TO verify your metaphor diverges from library patterns (or justify convergence).

### Step 5.1 -- Select Similar Case Studies

**Scan `/case-studies/_INDEX.md` (titles + tension summaries only).**

**Identify 2-3 case studies with SIMILAR tensions to yours:**
- Similar axis (FEEL, UNDERSTAND, BECOME)
- Similar tension type (warmth/austerity, complexity/clarity, etc.)

**Read THOSE case studies. DO NOT read all case studies.**

### Step 5.2 -- Divergence Comparison Table

**For each similar case study, complete this table:**

| Comparison Dimension | Your Metaphor | Case Study Metaphor | Divergence? |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Metaphor domain** | [yours] | [theirs] | DIFFERENT / SAME |
| **Structural isomorphisms** | [your mappings] | [their mappings] | DIFFERENT / SOME OVERLAP / SAME |
| **Section architecture** | [your structure] | [their structure] | DIFFERENT / SIMILAR / SAME |
| **Vocabulary** | [your labels] | [their labels] | DIFFERENT / SAME |
| **Mechanisms used** | [your techniques] | [their techniques] | DIFFERENT / OVERLAP / SAME |

### Step 5.3 -- Divergence Verdict

**For each case study comparison:**

**If divergence = DIFFERENT on 3+ dimensions:**
✅ **STRONG DIVERGENCE** — Your metaphor is novel. Proceed to Phase 6.

**If divergence = SAME/SIMILAR on 3+ dimensions:**
⚠️ **CONVERGENCE DETECTED** — Proceed to Step 5.4 (justification required)

### Step 5.4 -- Convergence Justification (If Needed)

**If your metaphor converged with a library pattern:**

**Answer these questions with STRONG evidence:**

1. **Did you complete Phases 1-3 WITHOUT reading this case study?** YES / NO
   - If NO: Violation of Phase 0D prohibition. Derivation is INVALID.

2. **Did content tension analysis INDEPENDENTLY lead to the same domain?** YES / NO
   - If NO: Pattern-matching occurred. Regenerate with constraint (ban this metaphor).

3. **Is the content tension IDENTICAL to the case study's tension?** YES / NO
   - If NO: Convergence is coincidental, not justified. Regenerate.
   - If YES: Proceed to question 4.

4. **Do you have DIFFERENT structural isomorphisms despite same domain?** YES / NO
   - If YES: Acceptable convergence (same domain, different execution).
   - If NO: Full replication. Regenerate with explicit constraint.

**Acceptable convergence example:**

- Case study: Geological metaphor for Boris content (warmth/austerity)
- Your work: Geological metaphor for DIFFERENT content with warmth/austerity
- Justification: Same tension + independent derivation + different isomorphisms = acceptable

**Unacceptable convergence example:**

- Case study: Geological metaphor for Boris content
- Your work: Geological metaphor for Boris content (same content)
- Justification: NONE — you are reproducing library output

**If justification FAILS:** Regenerate metaphor with explicit constraint: "BANNED metaphors: [list]. Derive NEW metaphor for same tension."

### Step 5.5 -- Extraction of Mechanisms (Final)

**After divergence verification, extract any NEW mechanisms your work discovered:**

**Mechanisms in library but NOT in your work:**
- [List — you didn't need these]

**Mechanisms in your work but NOT in library:**
- [List — you discovered these]

**If you discovered NEW mechanisms, document them for future library addition.**

**Phase 5 is complete when:**
- ✅ Divergence verified (or convergence justified)
- ✅ Novel mechanisms documented (if any)

**Proceed to Phase 6 (Output).**

---

### Stale Tension (re-using a resolved tension)
```

**RATIONALE:** Phase 5 grants case study access at FINAL timing (after implementation). Explicit divergence verification with binary pass/fail criteria. Forces conscious comparison, prevents unconscious replication (M6, M9).

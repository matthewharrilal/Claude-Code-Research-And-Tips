===============================================================================
## 1. THE ORIGINAL PLAN
===============================================================================

CD -- the Combination Dimension -- was conceived as Stage 5 in the KortAI
design pipeline. It was the terminal exploration stage, the last stop before
the system's patterns would be applied to real documentation pages through
Migration. The original plan was straightforward in its ambitions: 6
explorations testing how the system's components work together.

The 6 planned explorations, as documented in the original STAGE-HEADER.md:

| Code | Title | Content Scenario |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| CD-001 | Reasoning Inside Code | Code blocks + reasoning callouts + step indicators |
| CD-002 | Task Containing Decision | Task steps + decision points + outcome branches |
| CD-003 | File Tree with Callouts | File trees + annotation callouts + code previews |
| CD-004 | Essence as Background | Essence callouts as persistent background + foreground content |
| CD-005 | All Callouts as Conversation | Callout types in dialogue format |
| CD-006 | Creative / Crown Jewel | Designer's choice, most ambitious combination |

The framing was "component chemistry" -- how do components WORK TOGETHER? This
was reasonable at the time. DD had discovered density patterns, OD had
discovered organizational patterns, and AD was about to discover axis patterns.
CD would combine all of them.

But then AD happened.

===============================================================================
## 2. THE DISCOVERY THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING
===============================================================================

AD was supposed to be about spatial layout -- where components are positioned
on the page. It was supposed to be a third independent dimension alongside
density and organization. What AD actually discovered was far more profound.

Through 6 explorations and 28 findings, AD proved that spatial arrangement is
not a separate dimension at all. It validated a chain of equivalences that had
been building since DD:

```
DD-F-010: "Organization should SERVE density"
    -> OD-F-005: "Organization IS Density" (2-way identity)
        -> AD-F-004: "Axis IS Organization IS Density" (3-way identity)
            -> AD-F-023: ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (meta-equivalence)
```

This chain tells a story. DD first noticed that density and organization were
related. OD discovered they were not merely related but identical -- two names
for the same phenomenon. AD completed the unification by proving that axis
geometry is also the same thing. Three apparent dimensions collapsed into one:
ATTENTION TOPOLOGY.

The 3-way equivalence was validated through 5 distinct mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Pattern | Discovery |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Temporal | Z-Pattern (AD-001) | Z-sweep cycle IS one PULSE beat |
| Spatial | Bento Grid (AD-003) | Grid cells ARE dense islands |
| Proportional | Spiral (AD-004) | Border-weight gradient IS geological encoding |
| Kinetic | Choreography (AD-005) | Direction change IS density state change |
| Gravitational | Compound (AD-006) | Triple equivalence at compound scale |

This changes everything about what CD is and what it should do.

===============================================================================
## 3. WHAT CD HAS EVOLVED INTO
===============================================================================

Given the 3-way unification, CD is no longer discovering a new dimension. The
original framing of "component chemistry" is too narrow -- it makes CD sound
like a component library integration test, which dramatically undersells what
the stage must accomplish.

CD is a **stress test of the 3-way equivalence**. It asks the question that
AD's compound exploration (AD-006) only began to explore: when multiple
validated patterns from DD, OD, and AD coexist on the same page, does the
ATTENTION TOPOLOGY identity hold? Does it extend? Or does it break?

The reframing is critical:

| Aspect | Original Framing | Evolved Framing |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Component chemistry -- how components work together | Stress test of 3-way equivalence under combination pressure |
| **Core question** | Do these components look good together? | Does ATTENTION TOPOLOGY hold when patterns combine? |
| **What each exploration tests** | A content scenario | A specific pattern combination with declared DD+OD+AD pairings |
| **Success criterion** | Visually cohesive result | Equivalence preserved, extended, or formally bounded |
| **Likely discovery** | How to combine components | Combination grammar -- rules for composing attention topologies |
| **Relationship to prior stages** | Builds on DD/OD/AD | Tests whether DD/OD/AD's core insight is terminal |

Every CD exploration must now declare not just what content it presents but
which density pattern (DD), which organizational pattern (OD), and which axis
pattern (AD) it combines. Without this explicit pattern-combination mapping,
builders will treat explorations as content design exercises rather than pattern
combination experiments.

For example, the original plan described CD-001 as "Reasoning Inside Code."
The evolved plan describes CD-001 as "Reasoning Inside Code combining
F-PATTERN + BENTO + CRESCENDO, testing R5 findings H2, R1, and T1."

This is the difference between building a page and running an experiment.

===============================================================================
## 4. THE 8 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CD EVOLUTION
===============================================================================

Eight specific recommendations have emerged from the accumulated research,
each addressing a gap between the original CD plan and what the accumulated
evidence demands.

### Recommendation 1: Evaluate CD-005 for Redundancy

CD-005 (All Callouts as Conversation) was planned to test callout components
in conversational flow. But OD-001 (Conversational, 37/40) already explored
Q&A as PULSE rhythm extensively and scored among the highest of all OD
explorations. Cross-stage analysis flagged CD-005 as potentially redundant.

The recommendation is to either replace CD-005 with a "Multi-Axis Transition"
exploration -- a single page transitioning through 3+ axis patterns (Z to F
to Bento) with documented transition grammar, which would directly test
AD-F-025 at maximum scale -- or to keep CD-005 but sharply reframe it to test
something OD-001 did not. Specifically, CD-005 is only valid if it tests
whether a page composed ENTIRELY of callout components can sustain reader
engagement, directly challenging the R5-T4 two-callout limit under intentional
temperature management.

The counter-argument for keeping CD-005 is real: it tests the boundary of
DD-F-014 / R5-T4 (the 2-callout limit). But the team must decide before
building whether CD-005 adds genuinely new combination knowledge or whether
the Multi-Axis Transition test would be more valuable for Migration.

### Recommendation 2: CD-006 as Pilot Migration

This is the most significant recommendation. CD-006, the crown jewel, should
not be another standalone HTML exploration. It should be a pilot migration of
REAL content -- an actual documentation page processed through the emerging
pipeline.

The logic is elegant: if CD-006 can take a real page and express it through the
full design system vocabulary, scoring 39-40/40 without requiring design system
updates, that PROVES completeness. The system's language is expressive enough
to say everything it needs to say. If it fails -- if some content type demands
a pattern that doesn't exist or a combination that breaks the equivalence --
the failure happens during CD, where the team still CAN fix things. After CD,
the design system freezes. Better to discover gaps now than during Migration.

This recommendation is discussed in full in Section 10.

### Recommendation 3: HANDOFF-CD-TO-MIGRATION as Playbook

The handoff document from CD to Migration should not be a passive summary --
"here's what we did, good luck." It must be an active playbook -- "here's
exactly how to do your job." This means it includes:

- A pattern selection guide for every content type
- Confirmation that the pattern vocabulary is complete
- CD-F findings summary with migration implications
- Whether the 3-way equivalence held, extended, or was bounded
- What ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 contains versus v2

The precedent is strong. HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md (234 lines, enriched to 448) is
one of the most operationally useful documents in the entire chain. But it was
written for another exploration stage. The CD-to-Migration handoff is written
for a fundamentally different consumer: not another exploration team but a team
that must apply patterns to real content at scale. The handoff format must
evolve to match.

### Recommendation 4: Completeness Gate

CD cannot declare itself done based solely on building and auditing 6
explorations. A new gate -- the Completeness Gate -- must be satisfied:

```
CD COMPLETENESS GATE (all must pass):
[ ] Every component used in at least one exploration
[ ] Every R-5 finding validated OR explicitly deferred with reasoning
[ ] Density tolerance table complete (DD-F-013 operationalized)
[ ] CD-006 pilot succeeded (if pilot migration recommendation adopted)
[ ] Transition grammar validated at combination scale
[ ] 5-scale fractal rhythm verified under combination
[ ] Component chemistry properties (velocity, temperature, weight) tested
```

This gate prevents the syndrome where a stage declares completion based on
its exploration scores while leaving critical validation undone. DD left R-5
almost entirely unapplied. OD left provenance gaps that required 18-agent
remediation. AD left 7 R-2 findings deferred to CD. The Completeness Gate
ensures CD does not defer its own responsibilities downstream.

### Recommendation 5: Convention Spec Before Building

This is not a recommendation so much as a mandatory lesson from history:

| Stage | Convention Spec Timing | Result |
|-------|----------------------|--------|
| DD | No formal convention spec | Acceptable -- first stage, patterns still forming |
| OD | Built AFTER explorations | 3 quality dialects (Polished, Functional, Editorial), required 43-agent remediation |
| AD | Built BEFORE explorations | Zero quality dialect divergence |

AD's convention spec (AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md, 822 lines, 16 sections) was the
single highest-leverage quality intervention in the entire pipeline. CD must
create CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md in Phase 0, inheriting sections 1-16 from AD and
adding 4 CD-specific sections:

- Section 17: Combination Rules (how pattern combinations are structured)
- Section 18: Transition Grammar Extension (AD-F-025 extended for multi-pattern pages)
- Section 19: Component Density Tolerance Table (DD-F-013 operationalized per component pair)
- Section 20: Combination Accessibility Requirements

### Recommendation 6: Component Chemistry Validation

R-5 (Combination Theory) establishes that components have three measurable
behavioral properties: velocity (reading speed), temperature (emotional
register), and weight (cognitive load). These are not decorative metadata.
They are the dimensions governing whether adjacent components create rhythm or
monotony, harmony or collision.

CD must test these properties empirically:

- **Velocity:** Does placing two SLOW components adjacent (Code + Reasoning)
  create monotony per R5-T2, or does the content context override?
- **Temperature:** Does the Warm/Cold/Neutral taxonomy (R5-T3) predict
  perceptual comfort? Does intentional temperature sequencing allow exceeding
  the 2-callout limit (R5-T4)?
- **Weight:** Does cognitive load balance (R5-G3) hold across all axis-density
  pairings, or does axis geometry change what feels balanced?

These tests are not optional. Without them, Migration has no empirical
basis for component sequencing decisions -- only untested theory from R-5.

### Recommendation 7: Transition Grammar Extension

AD produced a 5x5 transition grammar (AD-F-025) classifying 20 directed
transitions between axis patterns into three types: Smooth (4 pairs -- same
mechanism, compatible density), Bridge (10 pairs -- need intermediary), and
Breathing (6 pairs -- require 48px+ gap). Choreography is the universal
bridge; Spiral is the most isolated pattern.

This grammar was validated for transitions between pattern sections within a
single page. CD must validate whether it holds at the combination scale --
when two patterns operate on the same page and their transition zones interact
with other combined patterns. CD must also extend the grammar if combinations
reveal transition types that don't fit the three-category model.

### Recommendation 8: R-5 Consumption as Primary Mission

R-5 (Combination Theory) contains 39 findings. As of AD completion, only 2
have been formally applied (5%). This is CD's primary research source, and
approximately 75-80% of it is unapplied.

The existing `combination-rules.md` (177 lines) captures only about 4 of the
39 findings as explicit rules. CD must dramatically close this gap, evaluating
every R-5 finding through its explorations and formally documenting which were
validated, which were extended, which were challenged, and which were deferred.

A terminology issue compounds this: R-5 uses a Warm/Cold/Neutral three-tier
temperature taxonomy, while `combination-rules.md` hybridizes with R-2's moods
(Reverent, Utilitarian, Deliberate). Phase 0 must resolve which taxonomy is
authoritative. The recommendation: use R-5's three-tier for binary rules, R-2's
moods for interpretive frameworks, and document the mapping in
CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md Section 17.

===============================================================================
## 5. WHAT CD INHERITS: THE FULL ACCUMULATED CONTEXT
===============================================================================

CD sits at the top of a 5-stage pipeline and inherits the most accumulated
context of any stage. Every prior finding, soul piece, pattern, convention,
and identity fragment flows into CD. Nothing is optional -- the chain is
cumulative.

### 5.1 Prior Findings (84 Total)

| Stage | Finding Series | Count | Key Finding |
|-------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| Stage 1 (Components) | COMP-F-001 through COMP-F-021 | 21 | Soul pieces discovered |
| Stage 2 (Density/DD) | DD-F-001 through DD-F-018 | 18 | DD-F-006 Fractal self-similarity |
| Stage 3 (Organization/OD) | OD-F-001 through OD-F-017 | 17 | OD-F-005 Organization IS Density |
| Stage 4 (Axis/AD) | AD-F-001 through AD-F-028 | 28 | AD-F-023 ATTENTION TOPOLOGY |
| **Total** | | **84** | |

### 5.2 The 20 Validated Patterns

| Stage | Patterns | Avg Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| DD (Density) | PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL, FRACTAL (+BOOKENDS, WAVE) | 34.5/40 |
| OD (Organization) | CONVERSATIONAL, NARRATIVE, TASK-BASED, CONFIDENCE, SPATIAL, CREATIVE | ~35.5/40 |
| AD (Axis) | Z-PATTERN, F-PATTERN, BENTO GRID, SPIRAL, CHOREOGRAPHY, COMPOUND | 36.2/40 |

Quality ascends with each stage. CD must maintain or improve this trajectory.

### 5.3 R-5 Combination Theory (39 Findings)

CD's primary research source, organized by tier:

| Tier | Type | Count | CD Priority |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Binary Rules (testable) | 6 | HIGHEST -- empirically validate first |
| 2 | Patterns (demonstrable) | 9 | HIGH -- build each at least once |
| 3 | Frameworks (interpretive) | 7 | MEDIUM -- harder to test definitively |
| 4 | Reference (lookup) | 11 | ONGOING -- check against all explorations |
| 5 | Guidance (soft) | 6 | BACKGROUND -- apply as applicable |

Key binary rules from R-5 that CD must test:
- **T2 (velocity mismatch):** SLOW + SLOW creates monotony
- **T3 (temperature flow):** Warm/Cold/Neutral sequencing matters
- **T4 (2-callout limit):** Maximum 2 callouts visible simultaneously
- **G3 (weight balance):** Cognitive load must be balanced
- **N1 (stack don't nest):** Components stack, never nest
- **N4 (depth limit):** Maximum 1 level of composition depth

### 5.4 R-2 Deferred Findings (7 Items)

AD consumed R-2 findings per-exploration but deferred 7 for CD-level
re-evaluation, as combination contexts may change how they apply:

- R2-1.1: Breaking the Grid (Intentional Mess)
- R2-2.4: Analytical Dashboard Storylines
- R2-3.3: Experimental Namespace (Kitchen)
- R2-4.2: Asymmetric / Broken Grid
- R2-4.4: Golden Ratio (typography application REJECTED, layout application OPEN)
- R2-6.1: Split Screen Layouts
- R2-6.3: Scrollytelling for Documentation

### 5.5 The 5 Soul Pieces (LOCKED)

| # | Soul Piece | Implementation | Violations (all stages) |
|---|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Sharp Edges Command Authority | `border-radius: 0` | 0 |
| 2 | The Archivist Speaks in Serif | Instrument Serif italic for Essence/CoreAbstraction | 0 |
| 3 | Callouts Share Family DNA | 2-zone + 4px left border + color differentiation | 0 |
| 4 | Shadows Lie About Depth | `box-shadow: none` | 0 |
| 5 | Squares Signal System | `border-radius: 0` on indicators | 0 |

Zero violations across approximately 19,669 tested elements. No 6th soul piece
was discovered (AD-F-028 confirms the 5-piece model is final). The ANTI-PHYSICAL
identity -- no perceived depth, no animated z-movement, no rounded shapes, no
material gradients, no parallax -- extends from these 5 pieces.

### 5.6 Component Chemistry (4 Combination Rules)

From `combination-rules.md` and R-5:

1. **Velocity sequencing:** Reading speed variation creates rhythm
2. **Temperature flow:** Emotional register shifts need management
3. **Weight balance:** Cognitive load must be distributed
4. **Semantic spacing:** Spacing encodes relationships

### 5.7 The Convention Spec Pattern

AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (822 lines, 16 sections) established the pattern of
pre-build convention specification. Sections 1-11 were inherited from OD.
Sections 12-16 were AD-specific. CD inherits all 16 and adds sections 17-20.

The companion document AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md captures the convention ideology
-- not just WHAT the rules are but WHY each rule exists, what perceptual
evidence supports it, and under what conditions it may be challenged. This
methodology itself is inherited as a process pattern.

### 5.8 Transition Grammar (AD-F-025)

The 5x5 matrix classifying transitions between axis patterns:

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Smooth | 4 pairs | Same mechanism, compatible density |
| Bridge | 10 pairs | Different mechanisms, need intermediary |
| Breathing | 6 pairs | Most cognitively distinct, require 48px+ gap |

Key rules: Choreography is the universal bridge. Spiral is the most isolated
pattern. Mode-transition breathing (OD-F-007) requires 48px+ breathing zone
plus visual signal at every organizational mode change -- arguably CD's MOST
critical inherited constraint since CD's entire purpose is combining patterns.

### 5.9 ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v2

Produced by AD, this is the full accumulated context (~700 lines) incorporating
everything from Stages 1-4, including AD-F-023 (ATTENTION TOPOLOGY) as a
pipeline-level identity principle. CD consumes v2 and produces v3.

### 5.10 Open Escalations from AD

Two locked convention conflicts remain unresolved from AD and must be
addressed before CD building begins:

| ID | Conflict | Recommendation |
|----|----------|---------------|
| ESC-001 | Responsive breakpoint (768px) vs bento pattern (needs multi-column) | Move collapse to ~960px for 4+-column grids; CD must validate threshold |
| ESC-002 | Scroll-reveal progressive enhancement vs content visibility | Initial CSS state MUST render content visible; JS MAY add hidden state |

===============================================================================
## 6. WHAT CD PRODUCES: TERMINAL OUTPUTS FOR MIGRATION
===============================================================================

CD is the terminal exploration stage. Everything it produces is consumed by
Migration -- and Migration is the last consumer. This gives CD's outputs a
unique character: they must be complete, definitive, and actionable. There is
no "next stage" to defer to.

### 6.1 Finding-Level Outputs

| Output | Expected Scale | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| CD-F-### findings | 15-25 findings | Formal finding declarations for combination knowledge |
| R-5 evaluation record | 39 findings evaluated | Which R-5 findings hold, extend, challenge, or break |
| EXT-CD-* bespoke findings | 15-20 findings | Combination-specific external research |

The finding count is expected to be slightly lower than prior stages (DD:18,
OD:17, AD:28) because CD is testing established patterns under combination,
not discovering an entirely new dimension. The most valuable findings will be
about combination behavior that does not exist in isolation -- new anti-patterns,
new recipes, and boundary conditions for existing rules.

### 6.2 Document-Level Outputs

| Document | Expected Size | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| CD-outbound-findings.md | ~300-500 lines | Formal CD-F-### finding declarations |
| CD-SYNTHESIS.md | ~300-400 lines | Cross-exploration synthesis |
| CD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md | ~300-400 lines | Quality gate results |
| CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md | ~600-800 lines | Convention spec (inherits 1-16, adds 17-20) |
| CD-RESEARCH-GATE.md | ~400-500 lines | R-5 evaluation (39 findings) |
| HANDOFF-CD-TO-MIGRATION.md | ~250-350 lines | Terminal gate file / Migration playbook |

### 6.3 Identity Output

ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3.md (~700-900 lines) must contain everything from v2
plus all CD discoveries:

- All CD-F-### findings and lesson chains
- Component density tolerance test results (DD-F-013 gate answer)
- Transition grammar refinements from combination contexts
- R-5 consumption record (from ~5% to target ~80%+)
- Combination-scale attention topology description
- Sequential vs parallel determination
- Whether a 6th fractal scale exists (expected: no)
- Any new anti-patterns discovered through combination
- Updated pipeline position showing CD COMPLETE

### 6.4 Artifact Outputs

6 HTML explorations (~400-600 lines each, ~400-600KB total) demonstrating
combination patterns. These are not just demos -- they are the empirical
evidence that patterns combine grammatically under the equivalence identity.

### 6.5 The Convention Spec

CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md inherits 16 sections from AD and adds 4:
- **Section 17:** Combination Rules
- **Section 18:** Transition Grammar Extension
- **Section 19:** Component Density Tolerance Table
- **Section 20:** Combination Accessibility Requirements

### 6.6 Validated/Extended Transition Grammar

AD-F-025's 5x5 matrix, validated at combination scale and potentially
extended to cover combination-to-combination transitions.

### 6.7 Combination Recipes

From R-5 testing, documented recipes for validated component combinations.
R-5 already contains 6 recipes; CD tests and potentially extends these.

### 6.8 Completeness Certification

Formal confirmation that:
- Every component has been used in at least one exploration
- Every R-5 finding has been evaluated
- The density tolerance table is complete
- The transition grammar holds at combination scale
- The 3-way equivalence is preserved (or formally bounded)

===============================================================================
## 7. THE 6 EXPLORATIONS: PATTERN COMBINATION EXPERIMENTS
===============================================================================

Each CD exploration is reframed from a content scenario to a pattern
combination experiment. The content is the vehicle; the combination test is
the purpose.

### CD-001: Reasoning Inside Code

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| **Content** | How reasoning content combines with code blocks |
| **Pattern Combination** | F-PATTERN + BENTO + CRESCENDO |
| **R-5 Tests** | H2 (functional contrast), R1 (kinship/cousins), T1 (productive tension) |
| **Key Question** | Does reasoning density build within code container boundaries? |
| **Risk** | Two SLOW components adjacent may challenge R5-T2 (velocity mismatch) |

### CD-002: Task Containing Decision

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| **Content** | How task structures contain decision-point content |
| **Pattern Combination** | Z-PATTERN + SPIRAL + PULSE |
| **R-5 Tests** | H4 (editorial spread), S1 (setup-payoff arc), A3 (decision paralysis) |
| **Key Question** | Can decision-point density pulse within task container confidence strata? |
| **Risk** | Decision Matrix inside Task may violate nesting-not-stacking (R5-N1) |

### CD-003: File Tree with Callouts

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| **Content** | How hierarchical navigation combines with annotation |
| **Pattern Combination** | BENTO + CHOREOGRAPHY + ISLANDS |
| **R-5 Tests** | H3 (visual anchors), H4 (editorial spread), G2 (container signal) |
| **Key Question** | Does hierarchical navigation choreography preserve island independence? |
| **Risk** | File Tree (Heavy) and Callouts (Light) share left-anchor, potentially causing visual monotony |

### CD-004: Essence as Background (Ambient Context Layer)

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| **Content** | How wisdom/essence content serves as ambient context persisting through sections |
| **Pattern Combination** | TIDAL + ISLANDS + GEOLOGICAL |
| **R-5 Tests** | N1-N4 (nesting rules), G2 (container signal), R2 (mood/reverent as frame) |
| **Key Question** | Can essence flow as continuous tidal substrate under dense task islands? |
| **Risk** | "Background" implies z-layering, which conflicts with ANTI-PHYSICAL identity |

**Critical reframing required:** "Background" must NOT be interpreted as
physical depth. The flat 2D identity demands Essence be a STRUCTURAL persistent
element -- a tidal thread woven through the page -- not a visual layer beneath
other components. This reframing must happen in Phase 0 before building begins.

### CD-005: All Callouts as Conversation (Subject to Recommendation 1)

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| **Content** | How callout components create conversational flow |
| **Pattern Combination** | PULSE + Z-PATTERN |
| **R-5 Tests** | T3 (temperature flow), T4 (2-callout limit challenge), A1 (callout cacophony), R3 (voices in sequence) |
| **Key Question** | Does carefully temperature-sequenced callout series still cause sidebar fatigue? |
| **Risk** | Potentially redundant with OD-001 (Conversational, 37/40) |

If kept, CD-005 must explicitly test what OD-001 did not: whether a page
composed ENTIRELY of callout components can sustain engagement. If the team
determines this does not add sufficient combination knowledge, the Multi-Axis
Transition alternative would test AD-F-025 at maximum scale -- a harder and
more valuable experiment.

### CD-006: Creative (Crown Jewel / Pilot Migration)

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| **Content** | Compound combination -- all patterns active (or real content if pilot migration) |
| **Pattern Combination** | ALL (FRACTAL meta-structure) |
| **R-5 Tests** | Recipes, quantitative guidelines, compatibility matrix at full scale |
| **Key Question** | Does the 3-way equivalence hold at maximum combination stress? |
| **Score Target** | 39-40/40 (continuing DD-006=36, OD-006=37, AD-006=38 progression) |

CD-006 is not just the CD crown jewel -- it is the PIPELINE crown jewel. It
should receive 30-40% of the research budget, following the DD-006/OD-006/AD-006
precedent where the final exploration receives disproportionate investment.

If the pilot migration recommendation is adopted, CD-006 becomes the most
operationally significant exploration in the entire 5-stage history.

===============================================================================
## 8. THE STRESS TEST FRAMING
===============================================================================

The stress test framing is the conceptual core of CD's evolution. Understanding
it requires understanding what AD-F-023 actually claims.

ATTENTION TOPOLOGY states that density, organization, and axis are not three
independent variables -- they are three lenses on a single phenomenon. When you
choose an F-Pattern axis, you are simultaneously choosing CRESCENDO density and
NARRATIVE organization. The variables are not free; they co-determine each other.

CD tests whether this co-determination holds under combination pressure:

### Test Level 1: Can Patterns Coexist?

The simplest test: when two validated patterns appear on the same page, do they
interfere with each other? This is the content chemistry question. CD-001
through CD-003 primarily test this level.

### Test Level 2: Do Combined Patterns Maintain the Equivalence?

A harder test: when an F-Pattern section transitions into a Bento Grid section,
does the Bento Grid section still demonstrate spatial equivalence (grid cells
ARE dense islands), or does the presence of the adjacent F-Pattern section
change the perception? CD-004 and CD-005 primarily test this level.

### Test Level 3: Does Maximum Combination Stress Reveal New Phenomena?

The hardest test: when ALL patterns are active simultaneously (through scrolling
time, per AD-F-024), does a new emergent property appear that no single pattern
exhibited? Or does the system simply compose without surprise? CD-006 tests
this level.

The likely answer, based on the elevation pattern across stages:

**Combination IS the grammar of attention topology.** Just as English grammar
does not add new letters to the alphabet but provides rules for composing
letters into words into sentences, combination grammar does not add a new
dimension to the topology -- it provides rules for composing existing
topologies into coherent multi-pattern pages. This is the expected CD
elevation, analogous to OD's "Organization IS Density" and AD's "Axis IS
Density IS Organization."

What would genuinely surprise:

- A genuinely parallel (non-sequential) combination pattern that does not
  create cacophony -- this would challenge AD-F-024
- The 2-callout limit breaking under intentional temperature management --
  this would show R-5's binary rules have interaction effects
- The compatibility matrix being context-dependent (changing per organizational
  pattern) -- this would show R-5's rules are less universal than claimed

===============================================================================
## 9. THE GRAMMAR METAPHOR
===============================================================================

The most powerful metaphor for understanding CD's role is the written language
analogy, which was developed through deep conversation about the pipeline's
ideological structure.

### DD = Inventing the Alphabet

DD discovered that visual density has a finite set of patterns: CRESCENDO,
PULSE, TIDAL, WAVE, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, BOOKENDS. These are not decorative
choices -- they are atomic units of how a page BREATHES. Before DD, the
instruction was "make it look good." After DD, the instruction became "this
page uses CRESCENDO because the content builds." The difference between
scribbling and writing: symbols that mean specific things.

Every page ever built uses these rhythm marks. They do not change.

### OD = Discovering Word Formation

Given rhythm marks, how do they combine into recognizable TYPES of expression?
A tutorial is a "word" -- specific structure (task-based, progressive
disclosure). An API reference is a different "word" (spatial organization,
random-access). OD proved that the same alphabet forms DIFFERENT words
depending on content structure. CRESCENDO in a tutorial feels different from
CRESCENDO in an architecture overview -- like "a" in "father" versus "cat."

After OD, there is a vocabulary. New content gets classified as one of these
word-types. Classification determines downstream behavior.

### AD = The Writing Direction IS Part of Meaning

AD was supposed to add spatial layout as a third variable. Instead, it
discovered that spatial arrangement is not separate from density or
organization. The writing direction IS part of what the words mean. F-Pattern
is not "put things in an F shape" -- it IS progressive disclosure. Z-sweep IS
one PULSE beat. Grid cells ARE dense islands.

This is why every page MUST look different. Pages express different attention
topologies. Tutorial and reference doc have fundamentally different topologies.
Sameness would be a bug.

### CD = Writing the First Sentences

Alphabet (DD), words (OD), writing direction as meaning (AD). Now: can you
write a coherent sentence? CD tests whether components combine grammatically.
Can CRESCENDO + F-Pattern + Narrative coexist on one page? What happens when
Bento Grid cells contain PULSE rhythm? The 6 CD explorations are 6 test
sentences in the visual language.

CD is the last time the language can change. After CD, the language is what
it is.

### Post-CD in the Analogy

The metaphor extends naturally beyond CD:

| Phase | Analogy |
|-------|---------|
| Component Extraction | Building a printing press (handwriting to movable type) |
| Content Analysis | Reading texts that need translation |
| Migration Playbook | The translation guide |
| Pilot Migration | Translating a few paragraphs to test |
| FREEZE | The language is complete |
| Full Migration | Translating the library |

A complete language can express any new thought in its domain without
changing. English did not need new letters for the internet. The design system
might discover new component combinations (new sentences), but the alphabet,
grammar, and writing direction stay the same. What GROWS is not the system --
it is the documentation of applications. The system freezes. Its demonstrated
capabilities expand forever.

===============================================================================
## 10. CD-006 AS PILOT MIGRATION
===============================================================================

The most operationally significant recommendation is that CD-006, traditionally
the "creative / crown jewel" exploration, should evolve into a pilot migration
of REAL content.

### Why This Matters

Every prior crown jewel exploration (DD-006, OD-006, AD-006) tested its
stage's patterns at maximum ambition using synthetic content. The content was
designed to demonstrate the patterns, not the other way around. This is
appropriate for stages that are discovering new patterns. But CD is the
terminal stage. Its purpose is not discovery -- it is validation.

A pilot migration inverts the relationship: instead of designing content to
showcase patterns, you take REAL content and express it through the patterns.
This is exactly what Migration will do. CD-006 becomes the proof that
Migration will work.

### How It Works

1. Select a real documentation page -- something with mixed content types
   (tutorial sections, code blocks, callouts, Q&A) that would stress-test
   multiple pattern combinations
2. Run it through the classification pipeline: what content type? what
   attention topology? what density pattern? what organizational pattern? what
   axis pattern?
3. Build it using accumulated patterns and conventions
4. Audit it with the full perceptual audit skill
5. Score it

If it scores 39-40/40 without requiring design system updates: COMPLETENESS
PROVEN. If it fails: the failure points reveal exactly what needs to be fixed
before the design system freezes.

### The Score Target

The crown jewel score progression creates a natural target:

| Stage | Crown Jewel Score |
|-------|------------------|
| DD-006 (Fractal) | 36/40 |
| OD-006 (Creative) | 37/40 |
| AD-006 (Compound) | 38/40 |
| **CD-006 (target)** | **39-40/40** |

Each stage improves by 1 point. CD-006 at 39/40 maintains the trajectory.
40/40 would be the ultimate validation.

### Risk Mitigation

The risk of pilot migration is that real content is messier than synthetic
content. Real pages have edge cases, mixed modes, unexpected structures. But
this messiness is precisely the point. CD-006 should be difficult. If the
patterns only work on content designed to fit them, they are not actually
patterns -- they are demos.

===============================================================================
## 11. THE COMPLETENESS GATE
===============================================================================

The Completeness Gate is a new concept introduced for CD that has no precedent
in prior stages. Previous stages declared completion based on building and
auditing their explorations. CD, as the terminal stage, must satisfy a higher
bar.

### What the Gate Checks

### Why This Gate Exists

The design system freezes after CD. Everything downstream -- Component
Extraction, Content Analysis, Migration Playbook, Pilot Migration, Full
Migration -- uses ONLY what CD certifies as complete. A gap in CD's coverage
becomes a permanent gap in the design system's expressiveness.

Prior stages could afford gaps because subsequent stages could fill them. DD
left R-5 almost entirely unapplied because CD would address it. OD left
provenance incomplete because remediation could fix it. AD deferred 7 R-2
findings because CD would re-evaluate them. CD has no such safety net.

The Completeness Gate makes this explicit: CD is not complete until everything
downstream needs is guaranteed to exist.

===============================================================================
## 12. EXPECTED SCALE AND TEAM TOPOLOGY
===============================================================================

### 12.1 Scale Estimates

| Dimension | Estimate | Basis |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Total agents** | ~18-20 | AD used ~25; CD's lighter scope reduces count |
| **Wall time** | ~4-5 hours | AD took ~5-6 hours with more phases |
| **Phases** | 5 main (0-4) | Convention/Research, Build (2 waves), Audit, Fix, Synthesis |
| **HTML explorations** | 6 | Same as DD/OD/AD |
| **Files produced** | ~25-35 | Findings, synthesis, specs, explorations, identity |

### 12.2 Team Topology

The team structure follows the proven pattern from AD, adjusted for CD's
lighter scope:

| Phase | Agents | Duration | Key Tasks |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Phase 0: Convention + Research | 4 | ~30 min | Convention Extender (sections 17-20), R-5 Evaluator (39 findings), Research Packager (EXT-CD-*), Convention Auditor |
| Phase 1A: Build Wave 1 | 3 | ~45 min | CD-001 + CD-002 builders + scribe |
| Phase 1B: Build Wave 2 | 3 | ~60 min | CD-003/004 + CD-005/006 builders + scribe (CD-006 gets extra time) |
| Phase 2: Audit | 5 | ~45 min | Visual, structural, fresh-eyes, provenance, synthesizer |
| Phase 3: Fix | 2-4 | ~25 min | Per-file fixers |
| Phase 4: Synthesis + Handoff | 3 | ~30 min | Synthesizer, identity scribe (v3), infrastructure updater |
| Weaver (persistent) | 1 | Full session | Tracks state, cross-references, maintains coherence |

### 12.3 Build Wave Rationale

The original synthesis recommended a 3-wave build (pairs of 2 explorations
each). However, a 2-wave build may be more efficient:

- **Wave 1:** CD-001/002/003 (simpler combinations of 2-3 patterns)
- **Wave 2:** CD-004/005/006 (complex combinations including crown jewel)

CD's patterns are COMBINATIONS of already-built patterns. Each exploration is
about composition, not creation. The patterns themselves are validated; only
their interaction is new. This is inherently faster than DD/OD/AD, where
patterns had to be discovered.

### 12.4 Key Process Lessons to Apply

| Lesson | Source | CD Application |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Convention before building | OD 3-dialect failure vs AD 0-dialect success | Phase 0 convention spec is non-negotiable |
| Per-file ownership in fix phase | AD fix execution | Assign specific files to specific fixers |
| `document.fonts.ready` before font checks | AD audit false positive | All programmatic font verification must wait |
| Workers must write files (Write tool) | Comprehensive Audit critical failure mode | ALL agent prompts must include file-writing mandate |
| Provenance incrementally during build | OD remediation crisis (18 agents) | Findings documented as discovered, not retroactively |
| Crown jewel planned from Phase 0 | DD-006 emerged unplanned; OD-006/AD-006 planned | CD-006 budgeted and scoped from Phase 0 |
| HTTP server before Playwright agents | All prior teams | Start server in Phase 0 |
| Lead stays THIN | All prior teams | Lead orchestrates only -- zero building, zero Playwright |
| Weaver tracks state continuously | All prior teams | Persistent weaver role essential |
| Binary rules achieve 100% compliance | Workflow metacognition analysis | All CD rules should be binary (testable yes/no) |

===============================================================================
## 13. OPEN QUESTIONS CD MUST ANSWER
===============================================================================

CD inherits 5 open questions from HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md and 4 additional
questions from CD research. These are ranked by importance:

### Tier 1: Gate Questions (Must Answer Before Building)

**Q1: Combination density tolerance** (from HANDOFF, CRITICAL)
When two axis patterns combine (e.g., Z-Pattern + Bento Grid), does the
combined component absorb both density patterns or require splitting? This is
the DD-F-013 gate finding operationalized at combination scale. Expected
answer: components maintain individual tolerance; combination adds transition
cost but does not change intrinsic tolerance.

### Tier 2: Core Experimental Questions

**Q3: Attention topology at combination scale** (from HANDOFF, HIGH)
How do attention topologies compose when multiple patterns operate on the same
page? This is CD's frontier question, most likely to produce novel CD-F
findings.

**Q9: New anti-patterns from combination** (from research, HIGH)
What anti-patterns emerge from combination that do not exist in isolation? This
is likely CD's most valuable empirical contribution for Migration.

**Q6: Combination rules universality** (from research, HIGH)
Do the 4 combination rules (velocity, temperature, weight, spacing) hold under
ALL axis-density pairings?

### Tier 3: Structural Questions

**Q2: Transition grammar scaling** (from HANDOFF, HIGH)
Does AD-F-025 grammar hold between separate combined pages? Expected: grammar
holds but requires additional inter-page conventions.

**Q7: Context-dependent compatibility** (from research, MEDIUM)
Does the component compatibility matrix change depending on which
organizational pattern is active?

### Tier 4: Boundary Questions

**Q4: Sequential vs parallel combinations** (from HANDOFF, MEDIUM)
Are there genuinely parallel combination patterns? Expected: NO, based on
AD-F-024. But TIDAL substrate (CD-004) may be the exception.

**Q8: Recipe composition** (from research, MEDIUM)
Can component recipes be composed (Recipe 1 inside Recipe 3) without violating
stacking-not-nesting?

**Q5: Fractal at combination scale** (from HANDOFF, MEDIUM)
Does combination create a 6th fractal scale? Expected: NO, per AD-F-028. The
5-scale model is the hard limit. Combination operates WITHIN scales, not as a
new scale.

===============================================================================
## CONCLUSION
===============================================================================

CD has evolved from "component chemistry" into something far more significant:
the terminal stress test of a unified theory of visual communication. The
3-way equivalence (ATTENTION TOPOLOGY) is either the complete and final model
of how content arrangement shapes attention -- or CD will discover its limits.

The 8 recommendations -- evaluating CD-005, piloting migration in CD-006,
evolving the handoff into a playbook, implementing the Completeness Gate,
writing conventions before building, validating component chemistry, extending
transition grammar, and consuming R-5 as primary mission -- transform CD from
a straightforward exploration stage into the proving ground for the entire
pipeline.

CD is writing the first sentences in a visual language. If the sentences are
grammatical, the language works. If they are not, CD is the last chance to fix
the grammar before the language freezes and the library must be translated.

The grammar metaphor captures the ideological depth: DD invented the alphabet,
OD discovered word formation, AD proved that writing direction IS part of
meaning, and CD tests whether you can write coherent sentences. Everything
after CD is translation -- applying a complete language to express real content.

```
DD (vocabulary) -> OD (syntax) -> AD (geometry) -> CD (grammar)
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                              ATTENTION TOPOLOGY
                                            (unified meta-concept)
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                                 MIGRATION
                                        (real documentation pages)
```

CD completes the circle. After CD, the system has vocabulary, syntax, geometry,
and grammar. Migration applies the complete language to real content. The
system's demonstrated capabilities expand forever through application -- but
its grammar, its rules, its soul, never change again.

# POST-CD-PIPELINE

## The Complete Roadmap From Combination Dimension Through Full Migration

---

## What This Directory Is

This directory contains the strategic planning documents for everything that happens after the AD (Axis Dimension) phase of the KortAI design pipeline. It captures an evolved understanding of CD (Combination Dimension), the five intermediate phases between CD and migration that nobody originally planned, the **two-track per-page migration pipeline** (assembly vs composition), the operational wrapper for ongoing content ingestion, and the key insights that make the whole system coherent.

These documents were produced by a 7-agent research and writing team synthesizing insights from two prior research campaigns (9 CD research files totaling ~3,500 lines, and 10 migration research files totaling ~5,800 lines) plus a conversation session that produced critical evolutionary insights about CD's purpose, the language analogy, and the freeze guarantee architecture. **The documents have been substantially updated (2026-02-13) to reflect pipeline evolution research and component taxonomy analysis**, which revealed the two-track reality and refined the skill integration model.

This is not a specification to be executed. It is a **roadmap to be consumed** before planning the CD phase and everything that follows. The actual execution specs (CD Convention Spec, Migration Execution Spec, Ingestion Operational Spec) will be produced by the phases this directory describes.

---

## Why This Directory Exists

The original pipeline read: DD -> OD -> AD -> CD -> Migration. Five stages. Clean. Linear. And dangerously incomplete.

Critical gaps were discovered through systematic research:

1. **CD's purpose evolved.** AD's discovery of the 3-way equivalence (axis = organization = density = ATTENTION TOPOLOGY, AD-F-023) transformed CD from "component chemistry" into a stress test of whether the unified theory holds under combination pressure. The original 6-exploration plan needed reframing, 8 specific recommendations, and a completeness gate that no prior stage required.

2. **Five missing phases exist between CD and migration.** Gap analysis revealed that migration assumes infrastructure that does not exist: implementable components (not just prose), a content inventory with **track classification**, a comprehensive dual-track process spec, pilot testing of **both execution paths**, and refinement. Without these, migration degrades to CSS reskinning that uses 0% of the OD/AD/CD research.

3. **Two execution tracks are THE architectural reality.** ~40-50% of pages are **Track 1 (assembly)**: mechanical combination of stable components using R5 grammar rules, 45-90 minutes per page, highly parallelizable. ~50-60% of pages are **Track 2 (composition)**: creative tension resolution through metaphor-driven composition using the tension-composition skill, 3-5 hours per page, sequential bottleneck. This split fundamentally changes timeline, cost, and execution strategy.

4. **The user's non-negotiable requirement demands architectural support.** "Once we start migrating actual documentation pages, I don't want to have to update the design system." This freeze guarantee is not achievable by hoping -- it requires systematic preparation across 5 intermediate phases that make the system exhaustively complete before migration begins.

5. **Skills encode process depth that documents cannot.** The tension-composition skill (839 lines, 7-phase pipeline with tension derivation and metaphor collapse) and perceptual-auditing skill (48 PA questions, quantitative guardrails) represent formalized process knowledge. They are not "nice to have" -- they are **load-bearing infrastructure** for Track 2 migration and quality assurance.

This directory documents the full picture: what CD should look like, what must happen after CD, how individual pages move through **two distinct execution tracks**, how new content enters the system, the complete timeline with **Track 2 as the critical bottleneck**, and the deep insights that make the architecture coherent.

---

## The Big Picture: Where This Fits

The KortAI design system follows a research pipeline that discovers design knowledge through progressive exploration:

```
Stage 1: Components (COMP)     21 COMP-F findings    Soul pieces discovered
Stage 2: Density (DD)          18 DD-F findings      Visual breathing alphabet
Stage 3: Organization (OD)     17 OD-F findings      Content type vocabulary
Stage 4: Axis (AD)             28 AD-F findings      3-way equivalence proven
                                                      ↑ YOU ARE HERE
Stage 5: Combination (CD)      ~15-25 CD-F expected  Grammar stress test
                                                      Track 1+2 validation
                                                      ↓
Post-CD Phases B-H             Bridge research to code
                                                      Dual-track infrastructure
                                                      ↓
═══════════ FREEZE LINE ═══════════
                                                      ↓
Migration (I+J)                75+ pages migrated    Real documentation adopted
                               Track 1: 45-90 min    Track 2: 3-5 hours
```

Each stage inherits everything from prior stages. By CD, the accumulated context includes 84 findings, 20 validated patterns, 5 soul pieces, 337 raw research findings, and the meta-discovery that density, organization, and axis are three lenses on a single phenomenon: ATTENTION TOPOLOGY.

This directory describes Stages 5 through Migration in comprehensive detail, including the **two-track execution architecture** that emerged from pipeline evolution research.

## Key Concepts Summary

### The 3-Way Equivalence (AD-F-023)

The most important discovery in the pipeline: axis = organization = density = ATTENTION TOPOLOGY. These are not three independent variables -- they are three lenses on a single phenomenon. When you choose an F-Pattern axis, you simultaneously choose CRESCENDO density and NARRATIVE organization. One decision, three automatic outcomes. This collapses the design decision space from a multi-variable optimization to a single-variable classification.

### The Written Language Analogy (Evolved)

The pipeline stages map precisely to the invention of written language:
- **DD = inventing the alphabet** (density rhythm marks as atomic units)
- **OD = discovering vocabulary** (content types as recognizable structural words)
- **AD = discovering that writing direction IS part of meaning** (spatial arrangement encodes semantic value)
- **CD = writing the first prose** (testing whether patterns combine grammatically)
- **Post-CD = building alphabet + vocabulary + prose into usable form** (from handwriting to movable type)
- **Migration = translating the library** (applying the complete language to real content)

### The Two-Track Reality

Migration is NOT a single pipeline. It is **two distinct execution paths**:

**Track 1 (Assembly)**: ~40-50% of pages. Mechanical combination of stable components using R5 combination grammar. 45-90 minutes per page. Highly parallelizable (6 agents simultaneously). Deterministic assembly process.

**Track 2 (Composition)**: ~50-60% of pages. Creative tension resolution through metaphor-driven composition. Full tension-composition skill pipeline (7 phases: content assessment → multi-axis questioning → tension derivation → gate → metaphor collapse → compositional layout → output). 3-5 hours per page. Sequential bottleneck (2-3 agents max). Judgment-heavy creative process.

**Critical implication**: Track 2 is THE timeline bottleneck. 35-45 pages × 3-5 hours = 105-225 hours of sequential work. This dominates total migration time and is fundamentally not parallelizable.

### The Abstraction Cliff

The gap between 15,000 lines of research prose and a migrated React page. Without the intermediate phases, migration agents fall back to "apply soul tokens, keep existing structure" -- producing soul-compliant CSS over untouched information architecture. The abstraction cliff is the reason the 5 intermediate phases exist.

### The Freeze Guarantee

The user's non-negotiable: once migration starts, the design system does not change. This works because: (1) the intermediate phases systematically close every gap between research and implementation, including **extraction validation testing** and **dual-track pilot migration**, and (2) the accumulated identity teaches HOW TO THINK, not just WHAT TO DO, so agents can handle novel situations without system updates.

### The Operational Wrapper

The migration pipeline is not software to be built. It is an emergent property of the post-CD phases. An agent loading the right context (accumulated identity, pattern library, combination rules, audit methodology, **tension-composition skill for Track 2**, **perceptual-auditing skill for Phase 5**) BECOMES the pipeline. The operational wrapper is a ~50-100 line spec that tells a single agent what to load and what to do for ongoing content ingestion.

### The Completeness Gate

A new concept for CD with no precedent in prior stages. CD cannot declare done until: every component used in at least one exploration, every R-5 finding evaluated, density tolerance table complete, transition grammar validated at combination scale, **both Track 1 and Track 2 validated in CD-006 pilot**, and CD-006 pilot succeeded. This prevents the syndrome where a stage declares completion while leaving critical validation undone.

### The Component Taxonomy (Tier 1, 2, 2.5, 3)

**Tier 1**: Locked soul tokens (typography, color, spacing, border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none). Never change.

**Tier 2**: Stable structural components (~12 components, ~400 lines CSS total). Extracted once, reused forever. Examples: stat-grid-4col, section-header, question-answer-pair, code-block.

**Tier 2.5**: Pattern recognition guide (~900 lines prose). How to identify which Tier 2 components apply to which content structures.

**Tier 3**: Metaphor-driven compositional arrangements. NOT extractable. Composed fresh per page using tension-composition skill. Examples: "timeline as geological core", "hierarchy as elevation map", "process as chemical formula".

**Critical principle**: "The metaphor shapes experience; the guardrails prevent it from breaking experience." Tier 1+2 are the guardrails. Tier 3 is the metaphor-driven soul.

### Perceptual Guardrails

48 PA (Perceptual Audit) questions derived from skill enrichment research. Quantitative thresholds prevent metaphor-driven composition from breaking usability:
- 940px minimum container width (65% of 1440px viewport)
- 16px minimum label-to-heading vertical spacing
- 32px minimum padding floor for all containers
- 40% compression ratio (768px must preserve 40% of 1440px vertical space)

These guardrails were discovered through forensic analysis of 15 HTML layouts and 30 visual fixes.

## The Story: How This Knowledge Was Developed

### The Research Phase

This directory's content emerged from **four systematic research campaigns** conducted in February 2026:

**CD Research Campaign** (9 files, ~3,500 lines): Eight research agents explored CD's scope, cross-stage evolution patterns, accumulated identity mechanics, combination theory application, and gap analysis. A ninth agent synthesized everything into the 645-line CD-SYNTHESIS-BRIEFING -- the comprehensive answer to "what is CD now that we know what AD discovered?"

**Migration Research Campaign** (10 files, ~5,800 lines): Nine research agents explored migration pipeline architecture, content ingestion patterns, operational wrapper concepts, post-CD phase sequencing, gap analysis, and complete roadmap planning. A tenth agent synthesized everything into the 780-line MIGRATION-SYNTHESIS -- the comprehensive answer to "what happens between CD and real documentation pages?"

**Pipeline Evolution Research** (5 files, ~3,200 lines, NEW): Five research agents explored skill integration patterns, execution flow differences, Track 1 vs Track 2 classification, impact assessment, and pipeline evolution synthesis. This campaign **discovered the two-track architecture** and refined the skill integration model.

**Component Taxonomy Research** (2 files, ~850 lines, NEW): Two research agents performed forensic analysis of existing HTML layouts and reconceived component extraction scope. This campaign **defined the Tier 1/2/2.5/3 taxonomy** and the principle "the metaphor shapes experience; the guardrails prevent it from breaking experience."

### The Conversation Session

Between the two initial research campaigns, a conversation session produced critical evolutionary insights that neither research campaign anticipated:

- **CD's purpose reframing**: CD is not discovering a new dimension. It is a stress test of the 3-way equivalence (AD-F-023) under combination pressure.
- **The written language analogy evolved**: DD = alphabet, OD = vocabulary, AD = writing direction as meaning, CD = prose. This analogy illuminated the ideological depth of each stage.
- **The abstraction cliff**: The gap between research prose and implementable code was named and diagnosed.
- **The freeze guarantee architecture**: The user's non-negotiable requirement was analyzed structurally, revealing why the 5 intermediate phases are load-bearing infrastructure.
- **The operational wrapper**: The pipeline is not software to be assembled. It is an agent with the right context.
- **CD-006 as pilot migration**: The crown jewel exploration should use real content, not synthetic content, as the insurance policy that proves system completeness.
- **The completeness gate**: CD needs a formal gate with no precedent in prior stages.

### The Skills Development

**Tension-Composition Skill** (839 lines, 7-agent team, 6 research files, 207KB): Built to formalize the Track 2 compositional process. Phases: Content → Assessment → Multi-Axis Questioning → Tension Derivation → [Gate] → Metaphor Collapse → Compositional Layout → Output.

**Perceptual-Auditing Skill Enrichment** (14-agent team, 11 reports, 7,019 lines): 28→48 PA questions (+79%), new guardrails + metaphor-awareness. Key guardrails: 940px min container, 16px label-to-heading, 32px padding floor, 40% compression ratio.

### The Documentation Team

Seven agents produced the original directory's documents in parallel (2026-02-11), each reading the full source material and writing their assigned document. **Four additional documents were added by the pipeline-update team (2026-02-13)** to integrate the two-track architecture and skill enrichment discoveries.

## What Comes Next

### Immediate Next Step: CD Execution

CD (Combination Dimension) is the immediate focus. Before CD can begin, a CD execution plan must be produced -- comparable to the Master AD Execution Spec (1,407 lines) that governed AD. This directory provides the strategic input for that plan:

- `01-CD-EVOLVED-VISION.md` defines what CD should produce and how it should be structured
- The 8 recommendations in Section 4 are specific, actionable changes to the original CD plan
- The completeness gate in Section 11 defines what "done" means for CD, **including Track 1+2 validation**
- Section 12 provides team topology and scale estimates (~18-20 agents, ~4-5 hours)

The operational starting point for CD is `HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md` in the provenance chain, which contains AD's terminal outputs and 5 open questions that CD must answer.

### After CD: The Post-CD Phases

After CD completes, the 5 intermediate phases described in `02-POST-CD-PHASES.md` build the bridge from research to implementation with **dual-track infrastructure**:

1. **Content Analysis + Track Classification (Phase B)**: Inventory all 75 pages, classify into Track 1 vs Track 2, pre-screen tension candidates -- 4-6 hours
2. **Component + Pattern Base Extraction (Phase C)**: Build Tier 1+2 components (~400 lines CSS), compositional strategy library (~900 lines prose), pattern recognition guide -- 6-10 hours
3. **Extraction Validation Pass (Phase D)**: Test 2-3 pages to validate component library sufficiency, document gaps, confidence report -- 1-2 hours
4. **Migration Playbook v2 (Phase E)**: Write the complete dual-track process spec (Track 1 assembly path + Track 2 composition path) -- 4-5 hours
5. **Pilot Migration (Phase F)**: Translate 2-3 pages spanning both tracks, process proof, **CRITICAL Track 2 per-page timing data** -- 3-5 hours
6. **Playbook Refinement (Phase G)**: Battle-test and update the process incorporating pilot learnings -- 1-2 hours

After Phase G, the freeze line activates. The design system locks permanently.

### After the Freeze: Full Migration (The Dual-Track Reality)

Full migration (Phase H+I) processes all 75+ documentation pages through **two distinct execution tracks**:

**Phase H — Migration Track 1 (Assembly)**: 30-40 pages @ 45-90 min each = 22-60 hours across 3-6 sessions. Mechanical assembly using R5 combination grammar. Highly parallelizable (6 agents simultaneously). Deterministic process.

**Phase I — Migration Track 2 (Composition)**: 35-45 pages @ 3-5 hours each = 105-225 hours across 9-19 sessions. Creative tension resolution using tension-composition skill. Sequential bottleneck (2-3 agents max). Judgment-heavy process.

**Critical reality**: Track 2 is THE timeline bottleneck and THE cost driver. This is not parallelizable work. Each page requires genuine creative synthesis through the full 7-phase tension-composition pipeline.

### Ongoing: Content Ingestion

After migration, new pages enter the same **dual-track pipeline** through the Ingestion Operational Spec -- a ~50-100 line document that tells a single agent what to load and what to do. Track 1 or Track 2 classification happens at Phase 1. Same 6 phases, lighter oversight, no coordination overhead. The printing press does not ask when the manuscript was composed.

The system does not change after the freeze. Its demonstrated capabilities expand forever through documented application. A complete language does not need new grammar to express new thoughts. It needs speakers who understand its grammar deeply enough to compose new sentences fluently.

**The two-track architecture is the complete model**. Track 1 is mechanical. Track 2 is creative. Both are necessary. Neither is optional. The design system's soul lives in the tension between them.

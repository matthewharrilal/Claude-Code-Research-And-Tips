# Flagship PA: Tier 5 Compositional Depth Questions

8 questions detecting compositional depth ABOVE the PA-05 designed threshold.
PA-05 4/4 confirms a page is DESIGNED. Tier 5 confirms it is FLAGSHIP.
Asked in EVERY Mode 4 audit alongside the 48 standard questions (56 total).

## PA-60: Design Moment Density

**Question:** "Can you identify at least 3 distinct 'design moments' -- places where the visual treatment does something unique that it does not repeat elsewhere on the page? Point to each."

**Detects:** Unique visual event count and distribution. A "design moment" is a combination of color, weight, spacing, or layout that appears NOWHERE else on the page. Middle pages have 0-1; Flagship needs >= 5 distributed across all scroll thirds.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 3 distinct moments AND at least 2 are in different scroll thirds AND each uses a unique property combination
- NO: < 3 moments, OR concentrated in first third only, OR moments are repeated component patterns

**Auditor Assignment:** F (Consistency+Rhythm)

## PA-61: Multi-Voice Composition

**Question:** "Do different visual properties (weight, color, spacing, type) seem to have their own independent rhythms, or does everything shift at the same time?"

**Detects:** Channel independence -- counterpoint vs unison. "Choir in unison" (all properties shift together) = Middle. "Ensemble with different parts" (properties have independent but semantically aligned rhythms) = Flagship.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 2 visual properties with their OWN rhythm (e.g., "borders appear/disappear at different pace than background shifts") AND independence feels deliberate
- NO: All properties shift at the same boundaries, OR independence reads as inconsistency

**Auditor Assignment:** F (Consistency+Rhythm)

---

## PA-62: Transition Variation

**Question:** "Find a section transition. Count how many visual properties change simultaneously. Is the result dramatic (3+ shifts) or quiet (1 shift)? Are there BOTH kinds?"

**Detects:** Dynamic range. All transitions equally dramatic OR equally quiet = no dynamic range. Flagship needs BOTH dramatic boundaries (3+ channel shifts at zone changes) and quiet boundaries (1-2 shifts at within-zone changes), correlated with content importance.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 1 dramatic boundary (3+ simultaneous changes) AND >= 1 quiet boundary (1-2 changes) AND dramatic placement correlates with content importance
- NO: All transitions have similar weight, OR placement does not correlate with content

**Auditor Assignment:** D (Flow+Pacing)

## PA-63: Fractal Zoom Coherence

**Question:** "Zoom into one component (a card, callout, table, or code block). Does its internal design echo the page's overall design language at a smaller scale? Then zoom back out -- is that relationship deliberate?"

**Detects:** Fractal self-similarity across scales. Whether Component-scale design echoes Page-scale organizing principle. Middle achieves 2 scales; Flagship needs 3+ STRONG scales with the same pattern direction at each.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies a component whose internal structure mirrors page-level design language AND can NAME the shared language (e.g., "both use heavy-to-light weight progression")
- NO: Components look generic (could belong to any page) OR relationship feels accidental

**Auditor Assignment:** E (Grid+Layout)

---

## PA-64: Restraint as Expression

**Question:** "Is there a section that is DELIBERATELY plain -- simpler than surrounding sections in a way that makes the surrounding richness more noticeable? Can you tell the difference between 'designed quiet' and 'forgot to design this part'?"

**Detects:** Whether the page uses restraint as a compositional tool. Richness = density x RESTRAINT x confidence. Restraint = 0 means maximalist noise. Designed quiet sections create contrast that amplifies rich sections.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 1 section plainer than its neighbors AND plainness feels INTENTIONAL (pause in music, not missing instrument) AND surrounding sections feel richer by contrast
- NO: All sections have similar density, OR plain sections feel unfinished

**Auditor Assignment:** C (Spatial+Proportion)

## PA-65: Multi-Voice Composition (Music Analogy)

**Question:** "If this page were a piece of music, would it be: (a) a single instrument playing one melody, (b) a choir singing in unison, (c) an ensemble with different parts?"

**Detects:** Highest-level compositional assessment. Single instrument = flat (1-2 channels). Choir in unison = coherent but uniform (all channels shift together). Ensemble = multi-voice (channels have independent harmonized rhythms).

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor selects (c) "ensemble" AND names >= 2 independent "instruments" (visual property groups with their own rhythm contributing to unified composition)
- NO: Auditor selects (a) or (b), OR selects (c) without naming specific instruments

**Auditor Assignment:** A (Impression+Emotion)

---

## PA-66: Negative Space Variety

**Question:** "Look at the empty spaces between sections. Are they all the same 'flavor' of emptiness, or do different gaps feel different from each other?"

**Detects:** Whether negative space is composed (varied, purposeful) or default (uniform). Spatial confidence requires different gaps serving different roles.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 2 perceptibly different gap TYPES AND describes how they feel different (e.g., "this gap is a pause, that gap is a chapter break") AND variety feels purposeful
- NO: All gaps feel interchangeable OR variety feels random

**Auditor Assignment:** C (Spatial+Proportion)

---

## PA-67: Novelty Beyond Competence

**Question:** "Does the page feel like it is doing something you have not seen before -- not just well-executed, but inventive? What specifically is novel?"

**Detects:** Creative surprise -- the unexpected-yet-perfect quality separating designed excellence from competent execution. Flagship needs >= 1 element that makes the auditor think "I haven't seen that before."

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor names a specific novel element, technique, or combination AND explains why it works (surprising but appropriate for the content)
- NO: Well-executed but familiar, OR surprising elements feel gimmicky

**Auditor Assignment:** A (Impression+Emotion)

## Tier 5 Aggregate Scoring

| YES Count | Verdict | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| 7-8 / 8 | COMPOSED | Full compositional depth. Flagship target. |
| 5-6 / 8 | APPROACHING | Significant depth. 1-2 layers need strengthening. |
| 3-4 / 8 | STRUCTURED | Some compositional intelligence. Multiple layers absent. |
| 0-2 / 8 | VOCABULARY ONLY | Mechanisms deployed but not composed. Middle-equivalent. |

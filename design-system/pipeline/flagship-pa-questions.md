# Flagship PA: Tier 5 Compositional Depth Questions

9 questions detecting compositional depth ABOVE the PA-05 designed threshold.
PA-05 4/4 confirms a page is DESIGNED. Tier 5 confirms it is FLAGSHIP.
Asked in EVERY Mode 4 audit alongside the 56 standard questions (65 total).

## PA-60: Design Moment Density

**Question:** "Can you identify at least 3 distinct 'design moments' -- places where the visual treatment does something unique that it does not repeat elsewhere on the page? Point to each."

**Detects:** Unique visual event count and distribution. A "design moment" is a combination of color, weight, spacing, or layout that appears NOWHERE else on the page. Middle pages have 0-1; Flagship needs >= 5 distributed across all scroll thirds.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 3 distinct moments AND at least 2 are in different scroll thirds AND each uses a unique property combination
- NO: < 3 moments, OR concentrated in first third only, OR moments are repeated component patterns

**Auditor Assignment:** F (Consistency+Rhythm)

## PA-61: Multi-Voice Composition

**Question:** "Do different visual properties (weight, color, spacing, type) seem to have their own independent rhythms, or does everything shift at the same time?"

**Detects:** Channel independence -- counterpoint vs unison. "Choir in unison" (all properties shift together) = Middle. "Ensemble with different parts" (properties have independent but semantically aligned rhythms) = Flagship.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 2 visual properties with their OWN rhythm (e.g., "borders appear/disappear at different pace than background shifts") AND independence feels deliberate
- NO: All properties shift at the same boundaries, OR independence reads as inconsistency

**Auditor Assignment:** F (Consistency+Rhythm)

---

## PA-62: Transition Variation

**Question:** "Find a section transition. Count how many visual properties change simultaneously. Is the result dramatic (3+ shifts) or quiet (1 shift)? Are there BOTH kinds?"

**Detects:** Dynamic range. All transitions equally dramatic OR equally quiet = no dynamic range. Flagship needs BOTH dramatic boundaries (3+ channel shifts at zone changes) and quiet boundaries (1-2 shifts at within-zone changes), correlated with content importance.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 1 dramatic boundary (3+ simultaneous changes) AND >= 1 quiet boundary (1-2 changes) AND dramatic placement correlates with content importance
- NO: All transitions have similar weight, OR placement does not correlate with content

**Auditor Assignment:** D (Flow+Pacing)

## PA-63: Fractal Zoom Coherence

**Question:** "Zoom into one component (a card, callout, table, or code block). Does its internal design echo the page's overall design language at a smaller scale? Then find the SAME component type in a different section -- does it adapt to its surroundings, or does it look identical regardless of where it sits?"

**Detects:** Fractal self-similarity across scales AND parametric echo (components adapting to zone context). Whether Component-scale design echoes Page-scale organizing principle, AND whether components respond to their local environment. Middle achieves 2 scales with static components; Flagship needs 3+ scales with context-responsive components.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies a component whose internal structure mirrors page-level design language AND can NAME the shared language (e.g., "both use heavy-to-light weight progression"). BONUS: if the same component type adapts visibly to different zones (denser in dense zones, airier in sparse zones), this is STRONG YES.
- NO: Components look generic (could belong to any page) OR relationship feels accidental OR same component type is visually identical in every zone.

**Auditor Assignment:** E (Grid+Layout)

## PA-64: Restraint as Expression

**Question:** "Is there a section that is DELIBERATELY plain -- simpler than surrounding sections in a way that makes the surrounding richness more noticeable? Can you tell the difference between 'designed quiet' and 'forgot to design this part'?"

**Detects:** Whether the page uses restraint as a compositional tool. Richness = density x RESTRAINT x confidence. Restraint = 0 means maximalist noise. Designed quiet sections create contrast that amplifies rich sections.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 1 section plainer than its neighbors AND plainness feels INTENTIONAL (pause in music, not missing instrument) AND surrounding sections feel richer by contrast
- NO: All sections have similar density, OR plain sections feel unfinished

**Auditor Assignment:** C (Spatial+Proportion)

## PA-65: Multi-Voice Composition (Music Analogy)

**Question:** "If this page were a piece of music, would it be: (a) a single instrument playing one melody, (b) a choir singing in unison, (c) an ensemble with different parts?"

**Detects:** Highest-level compositional assessment. Single instrument = flat (1-2 channels). Choir in unison = coherent but uniform (all channels shift together). Ensemble = multi-voice (channels have independent harmonized rhythms).

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor selects (c) "ensemble" AND names >= 2 independent "instruments" (visual property groups with their own rhythm contributing to unified composition)
- NO: Auditor selects (a) or (b), OR selects (c) without naming specific instruments

**Auditor Assignment:** A (Impression+Emotion)

---

## PA-66: Negative Space Variety

**Question:** "Look at the empty spaces between sections. Are they all the same 'flavor' of emptiness, or do different gaps feel different from each other?"

**Detects:** Whether negative space is composed (varied, purposeful) or default (uniform). Spatial confidence requires different gaps serving different roles.

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor identifies >= 2 perceptibly different gap TYPES AND describes how they feel different (e.g., "this gap is a pause, that gap is a chapter break") AND variety feels purposeful
- NO: All gaps feel interchangeable OR variety feels random

**Auditor Assignment:** C (Spatial+Proportion)

---

## PA-67: Novelty Beyond Competence

**Question:** "Does the page feel like it is doing something you have not seen before -- not just well-executed, but inventive? What specifically is novel?"

**Detects:** Creative surprise -- the unexpected-yet-perfect quality separating designed excellence from competent execution. Flagship needs >= 1 element that makes the auditor think "I haven't seen that before."

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor names a specific novel element, technique, or combination AND explains why it works (surprising but appropriate for the content)
- NO: Well-executed but familiar, OR surprising elements feel gimmicky

**Auditor Assignment:** A (Impression+Emotion)

---

## PA-68: Metaphor Spatial Coverage

**Question:** "Does the page's organizing metaphor persist across ALL scroll thirds, or does it fade or disappear as you scroll? Can you identify metaphor expression in the bottom third of the page?"

**Detects:** Metaphor spatial coverage and persistence. A page where metaphor appears only in sections 1-3 and vanishes in sections 4-8 has an ANNOUNCED metaphor (introduced then abandoned). A page where metaphor persists to the bottom has a STRUCTURAL metaphor (it drives composition throughout).

**Scoring:**
- YES: Auditor can identify metaphor expression in all three scroll thirds (top, middle, bottom) AND expression feels consistent (not forced or mechanical repetition)
- NO: Metaphor concentrated in top third only, OR disappears entirely after introduction, OR bottom-third expression feels like afterthought

**Auditor Assignment:** G (Metaphor+Ideology)

## Tier 5 Aggregate Scoring

| YES Count | Verdict | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| 8-9 / 9 | COMPOSED | Full compositional depth. Flagship target. |
| 6-7 / 9 | APPROACHING | Significant depth. 1-2 layers need strengthening. |
| 3-5 / 9 | STRUCTURED | Some compositional intelligence. Multiple layers absent. |
| 0-2 / 9 | VOCABULARY ONLY | Mechanisms deployed but not composed. Middle-equivalent. |

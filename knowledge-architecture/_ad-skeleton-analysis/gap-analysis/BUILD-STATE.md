## Status: ALL WAVES COMPLETE

## Wave 1: Analysts — ALL 7 COMPLETE

| # | Dimension | Agent | Lines | Key Finding |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Provenance Chain | provenance-analyst | 410 | 5 layers exist, skeleton knows 2-3; write contention on shared file |
| 2 | Research Loop | research-loop-analyst | 676 | No identity-research challenge protocol; R-2 orphaned structurally |
| 3 | Enrichment | enrichment-architect | 473 | 8 enrichment layers not enumerated; convention freeze too early |
| 4 | Identity Cycle | identity-cycle-analyst | 748 | No decision tree for identity-challenging findings; paradigm fit test missing |
| 5 | Verification | verification-designer | 647 | Convention Auditor = 20:1 ROI; 4 new file-only auditors proposed |
| 6 | Chain Layers | chain-layer-analyst | 561 | 8 functional layers in graph, not linear chain; CLAUDE.md mesh not specified |
| 7 | Retrospective | retrospective-miner | 560 | 7 gates contain hidden judgment; Mode C incremental untested during build |

**Wave 1 Total: 4,075 lines across 7 files**

## FINAL TOTALS

- **16 files** (7 analyst + 7 auditor + 1 weaver + 1 BUILD-STATE)
- **6,446 lines** of analysis (4,075 analyst + 1,787 auditor + 584 weaver)
- **15 cross-references** identified
- **5 contradictions** resolved
- **4 emergent patterns** surfaced
- **40 definitive gaps** ranked (5 CRITICAL, 10 HIGH, 18 MEDIUM, 7 LOW)
- **Core finding:** The skeleton describes WHAT TO DO but not WHAT THINGS ARE

## Cross-Dimensional Patterns (Final)

### Pattern A: BIDIRECTIONAL LOOP MISSING
- research-loop-analyst: Identity->research is one-way; needs circular refinement
- identity-cycle-analyst: Identity treated as ONE-WAY input, should be BIDIRECTIONAL
- Both propose challenge protocols but from different angles (CLASS A/B/C vs 4-branch tree)

### Pattern B: WRITE CONTENTION / FILE OWNERSHIP
- provenance-analyst: 2 builders -> 1 findings file = silent data loss
- enrichment-architect: Template enforcement weakness for axis CSS
- chain-layer-analyst: Build tools vs chain documents not distinguished

### Pattern C: CONVENTION FREEZE TIMING
- enrichment-architect: Freeze untested conventions = lock wrong decisions
- identity-cycle-analyst: v2 determination protocol missing
- retrospective-miner: Convention error propagates 6x with no intermediate check

### Pattern D: HIDDEN JUDGMENT IN BINARY GATES
- retrospective-miner: 7 of ~60 gates contain hidden judgment
- retrospective-miner: Anti-citation-theater is itself a judgment rule
- identity-cycle-analyst: Paradigm fit Level 3-4 are judgment, not binary

### Pattern E: DOCUMENT ENGINEERING vs PIPELINE
- enrichment-architect: "Document engineering problem, not pipeline problem"
- chain-layer-analyst: 8-layer graph, not linear file list
- provenance-analyst: 5 chain layers vs skeleton's 2-3

### Pattern F: UNTESTED MECHANISMS
- provenance-analyst: Builder incremental finding writing has 0 OD precedent
- retrospective-miner: Mode C incremental provenance never tested during build
- verification-designer: All new auditor roles are untested

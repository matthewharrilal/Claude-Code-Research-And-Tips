## PREAMBLE: RESEARCH STATE AT AD ENTRY

### Current Research Utilization (from RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md)

| Research | Total | UNAPPLIED | APPLIED | Application Rate |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| R-1 | 28 | 8 | 20 | 71% |
| R-2 | 27 | 27 | 0 | **0% (CRITICAL)** |
| R-3 | 51 | 40 | 11 | 22% |
| R-4 | 192 | 192 | 0 | **0% (AD PRIMARY)** |
| R-5 | 39 | 37 | 2 | 5% |
| **TOTAL** | **337** | **304** | **33** | **9.79%** |
| EXT-* | 94 | 0 | 94 | **100%** |

**AD is the CONSUMPTION POINT for R-4 (192 findings) and R-2 (27 findings).**
R-4 is AD's PRIMARY research input (same as R-1 was to OD, R-3 was to DD).
R-2 has been at 0% across DD and OD -- three full stages without consumption. AD is the designated consumption stage per r2-evaluation.md.

### R-4 Internal Structure (Extracted from RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md lines 297-313)

## 1. R-4 EVALUATION PROTOCOL (Wave 0)

### 1.1 Purpose

Read all 192 R-4 findings, categorize by AD exploration applicability, soul-check each finding, and produce a comprehensive evaluation matrix.

### 1.2 Evaluation Agent Instructions

The R-4 evaluation researcher MUST:

1. **Read R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS.md in full** (991 lines)
2. **Read ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.1.md** (539+ lines) -- the soul context
3. **Read anti-patterns/registry.md** -- what to avoid
4. **Read OD-outbound-findings.md** -- specifically OD-F-FL-001 (axis preferences per org pattern)

### 1.3 Per-Finding Evaluation Format

For EACH R4 finding (R4-001 through R4-192):

```markdown
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | R4-XXX |
| **Finding Name** | [from R4 document] |
| **Category** | [one of 13 categories above] |
| **Soul Test** | PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL |
| **Gate 1 (Soul Pieces)** | Does it contradict any of 5 soul pieces? |
| **Gate 2 (Locked Tokens)** | Does it require border-radius > 0, box-shadow, off-palette? |
| **Gate 3 (Anti-Patterns)** | Does it match anti-patterns/registry.md entry? |
| **Applicable AD(s)** | AD-001, AD-002, ..., AD-006, or NONE |
| **Application Guidance** | How to apply in context of soul constraints |
| **OD-F-FL-001 Alignment** | Does axis preference match the OD pattern's natural axis? |
| **Priority** | HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
```

### 1.4 Categorization Rules

Map R4 findings to AD explorations using OD-F-FL-001 (transitive chain: org->density->axis):

| AD Exploration | Org Pattern | Density Pattern | Natural Axis (from OD-F-FL-001) | Primary R4 Categories |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| AD-001 | Conversational (Q&A) | PULSE + TIDAL | Vertical flow, width variation | Classic Reading (Z/F), Visual Rhythm, Progressive Disclosure |
| AD-002 | Narrative Arc | CRESCENDO | Vertical progressive build | Cinematic Patterns, Visual Rhythm, Diagonal Patterns |
| AD-003 | Task-Based | ISLANDS + BOOKENDS | Grid/cluster layout | Bento Grid, Hub-and-Spoke, Golden Ratio |
| AD-004 | Confidence/Epistemic | GEOLOGICAL + CRESCENDO | Horizontal strata | Axis Transitions, Masonry, Progressive Disclosure |
| AD-005 | Spatial/Map | WAVE + ISLANDS | Hub-and-spoke grid | Hub-and-Spoke, Bento Grid, Broken Grid |
| AD-006 | Creative/Emergent | ALL patterns | Meta-axis (demonstrates all) | Pattern Combinations, Pattern Use Cases |

### 1.5 Output: R-4-AD-EVALUATION.md

Structure:

```markdown
# R-4 Axis Innovations: AD Evaluation

## Summary Table
| Category | Total | SOUL PASS | SOUL FAIL | AD-001 | AD-002 | AD-003 | AD-004 | AD-005 | AD-006 |
|----------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

## Per-Finding Evaluation (192 entries)
[using format from 1.3]

## Per-AD Applicability Matrix
### AD-001: [list of applicable R4 finding IDs]
### AD-002: [list of applicable R4 finding IDs]
...

## 25 Axis Concepts: AD Mapping
[map each of the 25 concepts to specific AD targets]

## Soul Fail Findings (for documentation only)
[any findings that fail soul gates -- DO NOT apply these]
```

### 1.6 Binary Gate

**PASS condition:** Evaluation complete with >=150 of 192 findings categorized by AD target.
**FAIL action:** Researcher must continue evaluation until 150+ threshold met.
**Rationale:** Some findings may be genuinely non-applicable (e.g., CSS masonry for native browser support -- not relevant to static HTML explorations). 150/192 = 78% minimum, allowing 42 findings to be marked NOT APPLICABLE.

---

## 2. R-2 CONSUMPTION PLAN

### 2.1 Context

R-2 (Creative Layouts) has been at **0% consumption for 3 full stages** (DD, OD, re-enrichment). The r2-evaluation.md file (produced during OD re-enrichment by researcher-1a) already evaluated all 27 R-2 findings against all 6 ODs with soul tests. The results:

- **25 SOUL PASS** (applicable)
- **2 SOUL FAIL** (R2-022 Overlapping Elements, R2-026 Card Animation)

### 2.2 R-2 Findings Pre-Mapped to AD Targets (from r2-evaluation.md)

### 2.3 Per-AD R-2 Finding Lists

| AD | R-2 Findings Applicable | Count |
|----|------------------------|-------|
| AD-001 | R2-002, R2-004, R2-005, R2-011, R2-016, R2-019, R2-020, R2-021, R2-025, R2-027 | 10 |
| AD-002 | R2-002, R2-003, R2-004, R2-005, R2-009, R2-011, R2-019, R2-020, R2-021, R2-022, R2-025, R2-027 | 12 |
| AD-003 | R2-004, R2-005, R2-007, R2-008, R2-011, R2-013, R2-018, R2-020, R2-021, R2-027 | 10 |
| AD-004 | R2-004, R2-005, R2-008, R2-010, R2-011, R2-013, R2-016, R2-020, R2-021, R2-023, R2-027 | 11 |
| AD-005 | R2-001, R2-003, R2-004, R2-005, R2-006, R2-007, R2-011, R2-014, R2-015, R2-016, R2-017, R2-018, R2-020, R2-021, R2-023, R2-027 | 16 |

### 2.4 Binary Gate

**PASS condition:** >= 18 R-2 findings have planned AD targets with specific application guidance.
**Current state:** 25 findings have targets (per r2-evaluation.md). Gate ALREADY PASSABLE from existing evaluation.
**Action required:** Convert r2-evaluation.md per-OD mapping to per-AD mapping during Wave 0. The r2-evaluation.md evaluated against ODs -- the AD research package must RE-MAP these to AD-specific axis contexts (e.g., R2-014 Bento Grid applies to AD-005's hub-spoke grid axis, not just OD-005 spatial pattern).

---

## 3. EXT-AXIS-* COMMISSIONING PROTOCOL

### 3.1 Precedent: How OD Commissioned EXT-* Research

From EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md and research-package-od-001.md:

**OD Pattern:** Each OD received bespoke EXT-* research in per-category streams:
- EXT-CONV (11 findings for OD-001)
- EXT-NARR (11 findings for OD-002)
- EXT-TASK (15 findings for OD-003)
- EXT-CONF (18 findings for OD-004)
- EXT-SPAT (16 findings for OD-005)
- EXT-CREATIVE (15 findings for OD-006)

**Key insight from OD:** EXT-* is the highest-leverage enrichment technique. 100% application rate across all 94 findings. 100% SOUL PASS rate (85% properly refined, 4% needs refinement, 0% rejected).

### 3.2 AD EXT-* Category Structure

| AD | Category Prefix | Topic Domain | Example Research Queries |
|----|----------------|--------------|------------------------|
| AD-001 | EXT-AXIS-CONV | Conversational axis patterns | "How do chat UIs handle vertical flow with width variation?" "Socratic dialogue layouts in premium docs" |
| AD-002 | EXT-AXIS-NARR | Narrative axis innovations | "Cinematic scrollytelling in editorial web design 2026" "Diagonal sections for narrative progression" |
| AD-003 | EXT-AXIS-TASK | Task-based axis layouts | "Bento grid for task management UIs" "Grid-based progressive task flows" |
| AD-004 | EXT-AXIS-CONF | Confidence/strata axis | "Horizontal strata visualization in data UIs" "Geological layer navigation patterns" |
| AD-005 | EXT-AXIS-SPAT | Spatial axis navigation | "Hub-and-spoke CSS Grid patterns 2026" "Spatial navigation with golden ratio" |
| AD-006 | EXT-AXIS-META | Meta-axis synthesis | "Pattern gallery layouts" "Design system showcase axis patterns" "Self-referential documentation layouts" |

### 3.3 Research Query Generation Protocol

Each EXT-AXIS-* researcher MUST:

1. **Read ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.1.md** as GUIDE (not just constraint)
2. **Traverse the provenance chain** from the AD's corresponding OD exploration backward:
   - AD-001: OD-001 header -> OD-outbound-findings.md -> DD-outbound-findings.md -> ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY
   - This traversal generates DIRECTED queries (see research-package-od-001.md "Chain Traversal" section for format)

3. **Generate 3 chain-derived queries** following the pattern established by researcher-1a:
   - Format: "Given [OD-F-XXX] + [DD-F-XXX] + [EXT-*-XXX]: What [specific axis question]? (Chain: [trace])"
   - Each query references at least 2 findings from the chain
   - Each query asks about axis patterns specifically (not density or organization -- those are inherited)

4. **Apply 5-gate soul test** to every finding:
   - Gate 1: Soul Piece contradiction check
   - Gate 2: Locked token violation check
   - Gate 3: Anti-pattern match check
   - Gate 4: Density pairing alignment (does axis serve the density pattern?)
   - Gate 5: Identity tension check (productive tension documented, not ignored)

5. **Use accumulated identity learnings to DIRECT expansion:**
   - The EXT-CREATIVE-001 (solid offset) NEEDS REFINEMENT status teaches: test semi-transparent uses before applying
   - The EXT-CREATIVE-002 (type cascade) deviation teaches: map all values to locked scale
   - The 100% SOUL PASS rate across waves teaches: the 5-gate test works -- use it on every finding
   - The "bold minimalism 2026" validation (EXT-CONV-011) teaches: contemporary trends CAN strengthen soul when filtered

### 3.4 Finding Format (Per EXT-AXIS-* Finding)

Follow the format established in research-package-od-001.md:

```markdown
### EXT-AXIS-[CATEGORY]-[NNN]: [Finding Name]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Finding ID** | EXT-AXIS-[CATEGORY]-[NNN] |
| **Summary** | [what the finding says] |
| **Application Guidance** | [how to apply in AD context, referencing specific AD HTML element] |
| **Source URL** | [URL -- web research required] |
| **Soul Test Result** | SOUL PASS / SOUL FAIL with gate details |
| **Gate 4 (Density Pairing)** | [does axis choice serve the inherited density pattern?] |
| **Gate 5 (Identity Tension)** | [productive tension documented or none] |
```

### 3.5 Volume Targets

| AD | Target EXT-AXIS-* Count | Rationale |
|----|------------------------|-----------|
| AD-001 | 6-8 | Conversational axis is relatively constrained (vertical flow) |
| AD-002 | 6-8 | Narrative axis has cinematic potential -- moderate exploration |
| AD-003 | 6-8 | Task grid axis has bento/masonry potential |
| AD-004 | 6-8 | Strata axis is specialized |
| AD-005 | 8-10 | Spatial axis has the most R-4 applicability -- richer territory |
| AD-006 | 8-10 | Meta-axis must demonstrate mastery -- deserves more |
| **Total** | **40-52** | OD had 94 EXT-*. AD targets fewer because R-4 is 3.7x larger than R-1 |

### 3.6 How Agents Use Prior Learnings to DIRECT Expansion

The accumulated identity is not merely a CONSTRAINT document -- it is a GUIDE. Prior learnings direct external expansion:

| Prior Learning | How It Directs EXT-AXIS-* Research |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| OD-F-005 (org IS density) | Search for axis patterns that SERVE the org-density identity, not fight it |
| OD-F-FL-001 (axis preferences) | Use OD-F-FL-001's per-pattern axis preferences as search SEED TERMS |
| DD-F-006 (fractal at 4 scales) | Ask: "Does this axis technique work at PAGE, SECTION, COMPONENT, CHARACTER scales?" |
| EXT-CONV-011 (bold minimalism 2026) | Search for 2026 axis trends that align with editorial minimalism |
| EXT-CREATIVE-003 (scroll witness) | Explore CSS scroll-driven animation as axis navigation device |
| EXT-TASK-013 (island layout variation) | For AD-003: research grid variation within consistent island boundaries |
| EXT-SPAT-001 (hub-and-spoke) | For AD-005: deepen hub-spoke axis patterns with spatial navigation research |
| EXT-NARR-001 (Freytag 5-act) | For AD-002: research cinematic axis transitions between narrative acts |
| The solid offset lesson (EXT-CREATIVE-001) | ALWAYS test: does this axis technique create false depth? If so, SOUL FAIL |
| The type scale lesson (EXT-CREATIVE-002) | ALWAYS verify: do any proposed sizes deviate from locked type scale? |

### 3.7 Binary Gate

**PASS condition:** >= 5 EXT-AXIS-* findings per AD exploration, all SOUL PASS.
**FAIL action:** Researcher must commission additional research until 5/AD threshold met.
**Quality requirement:** Each finding must include Source URL (web research, not internal synthesis).

---

## 4. AD RESEARCH GATE FORMAT

### 4.1 Structure

The AD Research Gate follows OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md format but adds R-4 as primary and R-2 as secondary:

```markdown
# AD RESEARCH GATE
## Finding-by-Finding Mapping Before Any Build

## GATE STATUS: [PENDING / PASSED / FAILED]

## 1. INLINE SECTION VERIFICATION
| File | Read? | Constraints Extracted |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v1.1.md | [YES/NO] | [extracted constraints] |
| OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md | [YES/NO] | [dark headers, code blocks, zone tokens] |
| R4-AD-EVALUATION.md | [YES/NO] | [applicable findings per AD] |
| OD-outbound-findings.md | [YES/NO] | [OD-F constraints inherited] |
| anti-patterns/registry.md | [YES/NO] | [what to avoid] |

## 2. R-4 FINDING-BY-FINDING MAPPING (PRIMARY -- 192 findings)

### AD-001 Conversational Axis
| Finding ID | Finding | Implementation Plan | Expected Evidence | OD-F Constraint |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| R4-XXX | [finding] | [how to apply] | [what to verify] | [which OD-F] |

### AD-002 Narrative Axis
[same format]

### AD-003 through AD-006
[same format]

## 3. R-2 FINDING-BY-FINDING MAPPING (SECONDARY -- 25 applicable findings)

[same per-AD table format as R-4]

## 4. EXT-AXIS-* FINDINGS (BESPOKE -- ~40-52 findings)

[per-AD listing of EXT-AXIS-* findings with application plan]

## 5. DD/OD CONSTRAINTS INHERITED

| Constraint | Source | Applies to Which ADs |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| DD-F-006 (fractal) | MANDATORY | ALL |
| DD-F-010 (org serves density) | MANDATORY | ALL |
| OD-F-005 (org IS density) | MANDATORY | ALL |
| OD-F-FL-001 (axis preferences) | MANDATORY | ALL -- axis must serve org-density |
| OD-F-AP-001 (2px epidemic) | MANDATORY | ALL -- no 2px borders |
| DD-F-014 (max 2 callouts) | MANDATORY | ALL |
| OD-CONVENTION-SPEC | MANDATORY | ALL -- dark headers, zone tokens, type scale |

## 6. APPLICATION RATE TRACKING

| Research | Total Findings | Mapped to AD | Target Rate |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| R-4 | 192 | [count] | >= 80% |
| R-2 | 25 (applicable) | [count] | >= 72% |
| EXT-AXIS-* | [count] | [count] | >= 90% |
| DD-F + OD-F | [inherited count] | [all] | 100% |
```

### 4.2 Per-Finding Tracking Columns

Every finding in the gate document MUST have these columns:

| Column | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| **Finding ID** | R4-XXX, R2-XXX, or EXT-AXIS-*-XXX |
| **Status** | PLANNED / APPLIED / NOT APPLIED / NOT APPLICABLE |
| **Applied In** | Which AD-XXX HTML file |
| **Evidence** | Specific HTML element or CSS rule where applied |
| **Date** | When applied |

### 4.3 Application Rate Targets

| Research | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| R-4 | >= 80% of applicable findings | Matches OD's R-1 target. R-4 is PRIMARY for AD. |
| R-2 | >= 72% of applicable findings | R-2 is SECONDARY. 72% = 18/25 findings (matches gate threshold). |
| EXT-AXIS-* | >= 90% | Bespoke research should have highest utilization (OD achieved 100%). |
| DD-F + OD-F constraints | 100% | Non-negotiable inherited constraints. |

### 4.4 Binary Gate

**PASS condition:** Research gate document exists with ALL findings tracked (R-4 + R-2 + EXT-AXIS-*), inline section verification complete, per-AD mapping tables populated.
**FAIL action:** Gate document is a DELIVERABLE, not a checkbox. Return to populate missing sections.

---

## 5. RESEARCH APPLICATION ENFORCEMENT

### 5.1 Binary Citation Rule

**Rule:** Each AD HTML file MUST cite >= N R-4 finding IDs in HTML comments.

| AD | Minimum R-4 Citations | Minimum R-2 Citations | Minimum EXT-AXIS-* Citations |
|----|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| AD-001 | 15 | 5 | 5 |
| AD-002 | 15 | 5 | 5 |
| AD-003 | 15 | 5 | 5 |
| AD-004 | 15 | 5 | 5 |
| AD-005 | 20 | 8 | 5 |
| AD-006 | 25 | 8 | 8 |

**AD-005/006 have higher targets** because they have the most applicable findings (spatial axis is richest, meta-axis must demonstrate all).

### 5.2 Citation Format in HTML

Follow established OD convention (from OD-001 through OD-006 headers):

```html
<!-- RESEARCH APPLIED:
  R4-001 (Z-pattern): Hero section uses Z-pattern diagonal sweep
  R4-050 (Visual Rhythm): Regular rhythm in step spacing (24px gaps)
  R2-005 (Whitespace as Content): 80px breathing zones between sections
  R2-019 (Typography as Primary): 48px serif display title, no decorative elements
  EXT-AXIS-CONV-001: [finding name]: [specific application]
  ...
-->
```

### 5.3 Research Package as Builder Input (NOT Post-Hoc Enrichment)

**CRITICAL LESSON FROM OD:** OD's first build (v1) had no external research. Re-enrichment (v3) required a 43-agent team to add research after the fact. This was effective but expensive.

**AD Protocol:** Research packages MUST be prepared BEFORE builders begin.

```
Wave 0: Researchers produce:
  - R-4-AD-EVALUATION.md
  - Per-AD research packages (research-package-ad-001.md through ad-006.md)
  - EXT-AXIS-* findings
  - R-2 AD-specific mapping

Wave 1+: Builders receive research package AS INPUT:
  - Builder prompt includes: research package + convention spec + soul template
  - Builder cites findings AS THEY BUILD (not after)
  - Anti-citation-theater: builder must point to specific HTML/CSS element
```

### 5.4 Anti-Citation-Theater Measures

**Problem identified in OD:** Citation theater occurs when research IDs are listed in headers but the actual HTML/CSS does not reflect the finding.

**AD Enforcement:**

1. **Evidence must point to specific HTML/CSS element:**
   - BAD: "R4-001 applied" (no evidence)
   - GOOD: "R4-001 (Z-pattern): `.hero-section` uses Z-pattern via `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` with CTA at bottom-right terminal position"

2. **Weaver cross-checks:**
   - Weaver verifies: citation ID exists in R-4 source document
   - Weaver verifies: cited element actually exists in AD HTML
   - Weaver verifies: element actually reflects the finding (e.g., if R4-001 Z-pattern cited, hero section actually has diagonal flow)

3. **Auditor verification:**
   - Fresh-eyes agent reads AD HTML WITHOUT reading research, notes axis patterns observed
   - Cross-reference: do observed patterns match cited findings?
   - Discrepancy = citation theater flagged

### 5.5 Binary Enforcement Gate

## SUMMARY: RESEARCH STRATEGY AT A GLANCE

| Phase | Agent(s) | Output | Binary Gate |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| R-4 Evaluation | 1 researcher | R-4-AD-EVALUATION.md (192 findings mapped) | >= 150 findings categorized |
| R-2 Re-Mapping | 1 researcher | r2-ad-mapping.md (25 findings remapped) | >= 18 findings have AD targets |
| EXT-AXIS-* Commissioning | 6 researchers (1/AD) | 6 research packages (40-52 findings total) | >= 5 EXT-AXIS-* per AD, all SOUL PASS |
| Research Gate | 1 compiler | AD-RESEARCH-GATE.md | Document exists with all findings tracked |
| Builder Input | N/A | Research packages bundled per builder | Each builder receives package BEFORE building |
| Citation Enforcement | Weaver | Cross-check citations in HTML | Min citations met, evidence real |
| Application Rate | Verifier | Post-build rate calculation | R4>=80%, R2>=72%, EXT>=90% |
| Scribe Logging | 1 scribe | RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md updated | All applied findings logged with evidence |

### Key Differences from OD Research Strategy

| Aspect | OD Approach | AD Approach (Improved) |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| Research timing | Post-build enrichment (v3) | Pre-build research packages (Wave 0) |
| EXT-* commissioning | 3 waves during re-enrichment | Single wave before build |
| Research application | Verified after build | Built into builder prompt |
| Citation quality | Some theater detected | Anti-theater measures + Weaver cross-check |
| R-2 consumption | 0% (deferred) | Mandatory consumption (>= 72%) |
| Research volume | R-1 (28) primary | R-4 (192) primary -- 6.9x larger |
| Chain traversal | Researchers self-directed | Researchers follow explicit chain traversal protocol |
| Identity as guide | Used as constraint only | Used as GUIDE for directing research queries |

**TOTALS (content sections only, excluding header):**
- **Raw source words:** ~1,575
- **Tables:** 7 (6-row, 5-row, 11-row, 7-row, 10-row, 5-row, three 5-row hypothesis tables)
- **Code blocks:** 5 (1 density signature, 4 component sequences)
- **Pullquotes:** 1 (Master Insight)
- **Prose paragraphs:** ~15

## 2. CONTENT TYPE MIX

| Type | Count | % of Content |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Tables | 7 major tables | ~40% of visual weight |
| Prose (synthesis paragraphs) | ~15 | ~30% |
| Code/flow blocks | 5 | ~15% |
| Lists (bullet + ordered) | 6 | ~10% |
| Pullquotes | 1 | ~5% |

**Assessment:** The source is TABLE-HEAVY. Tables are the primary visual anchors. Prose is sparse and functional (agent-facing, not reader-facing). The content is naturally structured and segmented, not narrative.

## 3. DENSITY MAP

| Zone | Content | Natural Density | Notes |
|------|---------|----------------|-------|
| Opening (Exec Summary) | SPARSE | Low word count, orientation text | Natural breathing space |
| Master Insight | FOCAL POINT | Single high-impact sentence | Pull quote territory |
| Principles 1-3 | MEDIUM-HIGH | Tables + explanatory prose | Peak information delivery |
| Principles 4-5 | MEDIUM-LOW | Short prose, thin content | Naturally lighter |
| Conflict Resolutions | MEDIUM | Prose-driven, 3 short sections | Argumentative structure |
| Architecture Matrix | HIGH | Dense 7-column table | Visual anchor |
| Component Sequences | MEDIUM | 4 flow blocks, visual rhythm | Structured variety |
| Top Findings + Anti-Patterns | HIGH | Two back-to-back tables | Data-dense climax |
| Hypotheses | MEDIUM | Three parallel tables | Future-facing, lighter |
| Metadata/Closing | SPARSE | Brief summary | Natural wind-down |

**Peak density:** Principles 1-3 + Architecture Matrix + Top Findings tables
**Density dips:** Opening, Principles 4-5, Closing
**Natural crescendo:** Builds through principles, peaks at architecture/findings, exhales through hypotheses

## 5. SPATIAL BUDGET

### Input Parameters
- **Estimated total prose words (after rewrite):** 3,200 (targeting 2,800-3,600 range)
- **Line height:** 28px (1.75 × 16px base)
- **Average words per line:** 12 (960px container, 16px font)
- **Section count:** 6 major groupings, ~12-14 visual sections
- **Tables to preserve:** 7 major tables (verbatim per instructions)
- **Average transition height:** 80px (section dividers + breathing space)

### Calculations

**Prose height:**
- 3,200 words / 12 words per line = ~267 lines
- 267 lines × 28px = ~7,476px

**Table height (estimated):**
| Table | Rows | Est. Height |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Density Dimensions (6 rows) | 6 | ~240px |
| Axis Patterns (5 rows) | 5 | ~210px |
| Component Characters (11 rows) | 11 | ~400px |
| Section Design Matrix (7 rows) | 7 | ~280px |
| Top 10 Findings (10 rows) | 10 | ~370px |
| Anti-Patterns (5 rows) | 5 | ~210px |
| Hypothesis tables (3 × 5 rows) | 15 | ~540px |
| **Total table height** | | **~2,250px** |

**Code/flow block height:** ~400px (4 sequence diagrams)

**Section transitions:** 14 sections × 80px = ~1,120px

**Header/hero zone:** ~400px

**Pullquote:** ~160px

**ESTIMATED TOTAL PAGE HEIGHT: ~11,806px** (~12,000px rounded)

### Budget Checks

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Content-to-void ratio | (7,476 + 2,250 + 400 + 160) / 12,000 = **85.7%** | GOOD — dense but not cramped |
| Min sections (ceil(3200/800)) | 4 | MET (6 groups, 12-14 sections) |
| Max sections (floor(3200/200)) | 16 | MET (12-14 sections < 16) |
| Section word minimum (>= 200) | Smallest group ~250 words | PASS |
| Content weight per section | 3,200 / 14 = ~229 words avg | PASS (> 200 floor) |

### Merge Check
- Groups A through F all carry >= 200 words of prose after rewrite
- No section needs merging
- Principles 4 and 5 are thin individually (~65-75 words source) but will be combined into one section in the adapted content (joint word count ~400+ after expansion)

---

## 6. ZONE COUNT & BOUNDARIES

### Zone Count (per S-15)
- Estimated total words: 3,200
- Rule: 3000-5000w = **4 zones**
- Recommendation: **3 zones** (per briefing's 3-Zone Crescendo with Exhale)
- Resolution: Use **3 primary zones** with the bottom zone subdivided into 2 sub-zones for internal pacing. This satisfies the crescendo architecture while staying within the S-15 range.

### Zone Boundaries (per P-05: content mass >= 800px, content type change, reader intent change)

| Boundary | Content Mass Above | Type Change | Intent Change | VALID? |
|----------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Zone 1 → Zone 2** (after Principles 1-2, before Components table) | ~2,400px (intro + 2 principles + pullquote) | Prose/table orientation → dense data tables | From "learning principles" to "seeing the framework" | YES (all 3) |
| **Zone 2 → Zone 3** (after Architecture Matrix, before Findings tables) | ~3,200px (principles 3-5 + conflicts + matrix + sequences) | Dense framework → actionable takeaways | From "understanding architecture" to "applying discoveries" | YES (all 3) |

## 8. CONTENT ARCHITECT NOTES

1. **The 11-row Components table is THE visual anchor of the entire page.** It should receive the most spatial generosity and be positioned at the start of the peak-density zone.

2. **Principles 4 and 5 are too thin to stand alone.** They share a theme (the visual environment — space and type). Merging them into one section prevents a density dip that would break the middle zone's momentum.

3. **The 3 conflict resolutions form a natural argumentative unit.** They should be visually grouped (same section styling, sequential flow) rather than separated.

4. **Exploration hypotheses are future-facing content.** They belong in the exhale zone because they point BEYOND this page. The reader finishes with curiosity, not exhaustion.

5. **The closing must come from the COMPLETE-ROADMAP's "variety expectation" and "what success looks like" sections.** This is the most emotionally resonant content in the project and provides the natural invitation ending.

6. **Tables are verbatim per instructions.** All 7 major tables preserved. Prose is 100% rewritten for human readers.

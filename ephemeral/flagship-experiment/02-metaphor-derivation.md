# 02 -- Metaphor Derivation (Flagship Experiment)

**Agent:** Metaphor Agent (Opus)
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Content:** RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md (337 findings -> 5 unified design principles)
**Tier:** Flagship (full pipeline, multi-pass audit, 16-18 mechanisms)

---

## Part 1: TC Phase 0 -- Content Assessment

### Step 0A: Content Type Classification

**Classification: PROSE-DOMINANT** (<30% code/tables/diagrams)

The RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS document is structured prose with embedded markdown tables. The tables serve as compressed evidence summaries, not as data artifacts. The content is overwhelmingly narrative: it ARGUES for five unified design principles derived from five parallel research streams. The tables are rhetorical devices (organizing findings for persuasion), not data displays.

**Route: STANDARD path. Proceed to Phase 1.**

### Step 0B: Scope Assessment

**Classification: STANDARD** (approximately 2,500 words)

The content has clear natural sections: executive summary, five principles, three conflict resolutions, a showcase architecture, and actionable findings. Full pipeline appropriate.

### Step 0C: Section Identification

| Section | Classification | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Executive Summary | NARRATIVE | Sets the frame: 5 agents, 337 findings, 1 master insight |
| Principle 1: Density as Rhythm | MIXED | Prose argument + dimension table |
| Principle 2: Layout as Choreography | MIXED | Prose argument + pattern-to-use table |
| Principle 3: Components as Characters | MIXED | Prose argument + personality table |
| Principle 4: Whitespace as Design Element | NARRATIVE | Prose with concrete spacing values |
| Principle 5: Editorial Confidence | NARRATIVE | Typography hierarchy argument |
| Conflicting Insights | NARRATIVE | Three conflict/resolution pairs |
| Showcase Architecture | REFERENCE | Section design matrix + component sequences |
| Actionable Findings | REFERENCE | Top 10 + top 5 anti-patterns |
| Exploration Hypotheses | REFERENCE | Three hypothesis tables |

**Flagged incompatible sections:** The Showcase Architecture and Exploration Hypotheses sections are REFERENCE mode -- they will need section-level treatment variation in Phase 4.

### Step 0D: Tier Classification

**Classification: FLAGSHIP**

This is THE anchor content of the design system -- the document that synthesizes all research into unified principles. It is philosophical deep-dive content: "layout as content, not container" is a paradigm claim. The page's form must DEMONSTRATE the principles it describes. This demands multi-pass audit and the highest tier.

**Proceed to Phase 1 (full pipeline).**

---

## Part 2: TC Phase 1 -- Multi-Axis Questioning

### FEEL Axis

**Question:** "What does the reader need to FEEL while navigating this content?"

**Needs:**
- CONVERGENCE: The feeling that 337 scattered findings are being drawn together into clarity. Not chaos resolved, but disparate threads woven.
- AUTHORITY: This is the document that synthesizes ALL research. The reader must feel they are receiving a settled verdict, not an ongoing debate.
- MOMENTUM: The content builds from raw material (337 findings) to refined principles (5) to concrete application (top 10 actions). The reader should feel progressive distillation.
- CONFIDENCE: By the end, the reader should feel they KNOW what to do -- the synthesis resolved ambiguity.

**Structural Properties:** Convergence (many-to-few), progressive distillation, settled authority, momentum
**Richness: HIGH** -- Authority vs. warmth, convergence vs. KortAI's already-authoritative personality. This is rich because the content demands a SPECIFIC kind of authority (earned through evidence) that differs from the system's DEFAULT authority (declared through sharpness).

### UNDERSTAND Axis

**Question:** "What does the reader need to UNDERSTAND about the relationships in this content?"

**Needs:**
- PROVENANCE: Each principle traces to specific research streams (R-1 + R-3, R-2 + R-4, etc.). The reader needs to understand WHERE each principle came from.
- CONVERGENCE TOPOLOGY: Two research streams converge to produce one principle. This is not a linear story but a many-to-few mapping.
- CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Three conflicts arose during synthesis. The reader must understand how each was resolved without compromise.
- HIERARCHY OF APPLICATION: Not all findings are equal. Top 10 > general principles > hypotheses for future work.

**Structural Properties:** Many-to-few mapping, attribution chains, conflict/resolution pairs, ranked lists
**Richness: HIGH** -- The TOPOLOGY of convergence (337 -> 5) is structurally rich. The system has no direct tool for showing "multiple independent sources converging to one conclusion."

### DO Axis

**Question:** "What does the reader need to DO with this content after reading?"

**Needs:**
- APPLY the 5 principles to future section builds
- SEQUENCE correctly: some findings are prerequisites for others
- AVOID the 5 anti-patterns
- SELECT appropriate patterns (Bento, Z-pattern, F-pattern, etc.) for specific content types

**Structural Properties:** Ordered application, conditional selection, binary avoid/adopt
**Richness: MEDIUM** -- The system already provides decision matrices and task components. Direct tools available.

### BECOME Axis

**Question:** "What does the reader need to BECOME after absorbing this content?"

**Needs:**
- A SYNTHESIZER: Someone who sees density as rhythm, layout as choreography, components as characters. Not just someone who knows the rules but someone who THINKS in the synthesis's vocabulary.
- A PRACTITIONER with JUDGMENT: The principles require taste-based decisions (density signature per section, component sequence selection). The reader becomes someone who can make those decisions.

**Structural Properties:** Vocabulary adoption, judgment framework, identity transformation
**Richness: HIGH** -- The reader must BECOME a different kind of designer. This opposes KortAI's already-decisive personality: the content demands the reader develop their OWN judgment, while the system's personality asserts ITS judgment.

### NAVIGATE Axis (Extended Core)

**Needs:**
- NON-LINEAR ACCESS: The 5 principles are independent. A reader may enter at Principle 3 (Components as Characters) without needing Principles 1-2.
- DEPTH CONTROL: Some readers need just the principle statement; others need the full table + implementation guidance.
- CROSS-REFERENCE: Principles reference each other (Principle 1 and 4 both address density; Principles 2 and 3 both address component behavior).

**Structural Properties:** Random access, progressive disclosure, cross-referencing
**Richness: MEDIUM** -- The system provides navigation components but the cross-referencing topology is non-trivial.

### TRUST Axis (Extended Core)

**Needs:**
- EVIDENCE GROUNDING: Each claim is backed by specific research streams (R-1 through R-5, 337 total findings). The reader must TRUST this synthesis represents the research accurately.
- CONFLICT HONESTY: The document acknowledges 3 conflicts. This transparency builds trust.
- PRECEDENT: DD/OD/CD explorations validated these principles in practice.

**Structural Properties:** Attribution, evidence chains, conflict acknowledgment
**Richness: MEDIUM** -- The system's personality IS authoritative. Trust partially aligns with the system.

### EVALUATE Axis (Extended Core)

**LOW YIELD.** The reader is not asked to evaluate competing alternatives -- the synthesis has already resolved those conflicts. Mark as LOW YIELD.

### ORIENT Axis (Extended Core)

**Needs:**
- PIPELINE POSITION: This document sits AFTER five research streams and BEFORE exploration stages. The reader needs to know they are reading the distillation layer, not raw research.
- SCALE AWARENESS: 337 findings -> 5 principles is an extraordinary compression ratio. The reader must orient to this scale.

**Structural Properties:** Positional context, compression awareness
**Richness: MEDIUM**

### RECONCILE Axis (Extended Core)

**Needs:**
- "Layout as content, not container" CONTRADICTS most documentation design practice. The reader must reconcile this claim with their existing assumptions.
- "Components are characters in a narrative" CONTRADICTS the default mental model of components as interchangeable widgets.
- "Density has rhythm" CONTRADICTS the default assumption that density is a static property.

**Structural Properties:** Paradigm shift, assumption inversion, vocabulary replacement
**Richness: HIGH** -- RECONCILE is THE richest axis against KortAI. The content makes paradigm claims that oppose what readers already believe. The system's decisive personality could support OR undermine reconciliation.

### DISCOVER Axis (Structural Trigger -- DEPLOYED)

**Signal:** The content has genuine aha-moments: the Master Insight ("The best documentation showcases treat layout as content, not container") is a delayed synthesis that only makes sense AFTER seeing the five research streams. The three conflict resolutions are each mini-discoveries.

**Needs:**
- PROGRESSIVE REVELATION: The master insight should land as a DISCOVERY, not an announcement.
- SETUP-PAYOFF: Each principle should feel like it was EARNED through the research evidence, not declared.

**Structural Properties:** Delayed payoff, question-before-answer ordering, earned revelation
**Richness: HIGH** -- DISCOVER opposes KortAI's directness. The system labels and announces; the content wants to be discovered.

### SEE Axis (Structural Trigger -- DEPLOYED)

**Signal:** The content describes a many-to-few convergence topology (337 -> 5) and a section design matrix with intersecting dimensions.

**Needs:**
- The SHAPE of convergence: five streams narrowing to five principles
- The ARCHITECTURE of the showcase: sections, axis patterns, density rhythms

**Structural Properties:** Topological visualization, dimensional intersection
**Richness: MEDIUM** -- Interesting but secondary to the convergence story.

### REMEMBER Axis (Structural Trigger -- DEPLOYED)

**Signal:** The Top 10 actionable findings and Top 5 anti-patterns are reference material meant to be internalized.

**Needs:**
- MNEMONIC STRUCTURE: The reader should remember "one concept per viewport," "never stack same-velocity components," etc.
- CHUNKING: The 5 principles should be memorable as a cohesive set.

**Structural Properties:** Visual chunking, regular rhythm, summary anchors
**Richness: LOW** -- The system already provides components for this.

### Phase 1 Summary: Axis Yield Table

| Axis | Richness | Key Structural Property | Primary Tension Potential |
|------|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| FEEL | HIGH | Convergence, progressive distillation | Earned authority vs. declared authority |
| UNDERSTAND | HIGH | Many-to-few mapping, attribution chains | Convergence topology vs. flat layout |
| DO | MEDIUM | Conditional selection, sequencing | Direct tool available |
| BECOME | HIGH | Vocabulary adoption, judgment | Reader's judgment vs. system's judgment |
| NAVIGATE | MEDIUM | Random access, cross-referencing | Moderate |
| TRUST | MEDIUM | Attribution, evidence chains | Partially aligned with system |
| EVALUATE | LOW | -- | LOW YIELD |
| ORIENT | MEDIUM | Positional context, compression scale | Moderate |
| RECONCILE | HIGH | Paradigm shift, assumption inversion | STRONGEST potential |
| DISCOVER | HIGH | Delayed payoff, earned revelation | Oppositional (directness vs. discovery) |
| SEE | MEDIUM | Convergence topology | Secondary |
| REMEMBER | LOW | Chunking, mnemonics | LOW YIELD |

**Highest-yield axes: FEEL + UNDERSTAND + RECONCILE + DISCOVER**

**Compound tension candidate: UNDERSTAND + DISCOVER** -- oppositional structural demands (reveal convergence topology vs. withhold for progressive discovery). This pair produces richer tension than either alone.

---

## Part 3: TC Phase 2 -- Tension Derivation

### Primary Tension: UNDERSTAND + DISCOVER vs. KortAI System

**Side A (Reader Needs):**
- Must UNDERSTAND the convergence topology (337 findings from 5 streams -> 5 principles)
- Must DISCOVER the master insight through the experience of reading, not by announcement
- Must FEEL progressive distillation: the sensation of scattered data being refined into clarity
- Must RECONCILE "layout as content" with their existing mental model

**Side B (KortAI Design System):**
- DECLARES rather than reveals (75% austere, 85% serious, 80% formal)
- LABELS rather than implies (editorial precision, mono-font meta labels)
- ANNOUNCES rather than builds up to (decisive, verdict-driven)
- Has no native tool for showing "convergence" or "distillation" or "many-to-few"

### Addition Test

> Can you fulfill the reader's need by selecting and placing existing design system components without transforming their meaning?

**NO.**

No existing component expresses "five independent streams converging to one insight." No existing layout pattern expresses "progressive distillation." The Table of Contents component shows hierarchy, not convergence. The callout components show annotation, not synthesis. The reader needs to EXPERIENCE the shape of synthesis (many -> few, scattered -> unified) and the system has no native tool for that experience.

**GENUINE tension confirmed.**

### BECAUSE Test

- The reader needs to FEEL convergence BECAUSE the content is literally about 337 findings being distilled into 5 principles -- the compression ratio (67:1) IS the story.
- The reader needs to DISCOVER the master insight BECAUSE the insight ("layout as content, not container") only makes sense as a conclusion from evidence, not as an assertion.
- The reader needs to UNDERSTAND provenance BECAUSE each principle has exactly 2 research stream parents (R-1+R-3, R-2+R-4, R-5+Soul) and the parentage matters for trust.

**All BECAUSE tests pass with specific content properties.**

### Richness Scoring

**Dimension 1: Opposition Depth**
- Layer 1: System DECLARES (labels, headings) vs. content needs DISCOVERY (progressive revelation)
- Layer 2: System is FLAT (no z-axis, no depth illusion) vs. content needs CONVERGENCE (multiple sources collapsing to one point)
- Layer 3: System is DECISIVE (single-verdict) vs. content needs RECONCILIATION (holding contradictions before resolving)
- Layer 4: System is SPARSE (70% sparse) vs. content needs DENSITY RHYTHM (alternating dense evidence and sparse principles)
- **Score: 3 (HIGH)** -- 4 layers of opposition

**Dimension 2: Structural Overlap Density**
- ORDERING: Both sides naturally order (system: heading hierarchy; content: principle numbering)
- CONTAINMENT: Both sides naturally contain (system: bordered components; content: principles as discrete units)
- LAYERING: Both sides naturally layer (system: zone backgrounds; content: research streams stacking)
- PROGRESSION: Both sides naturally progress (system: spacing scale; content: raw findings -> principles -> actions)
- CONVERGENCE: System has weak native expression (hierarchy narrows toward top); content has strong demand
- **Score: 3 (HIGH)** -- 5 shared properties

**Dimension 3: Metaphor Space Width**
- Candidate 1: Distillery / Refinery (raw material refined through stages)
- Candidate 2: Cartographic Survey (five expeditions mapped to unified territory)
- Candidate 3: Assay / Ore Processing (many samples tested, few meet threshold)
- Candidate 4: Judicial Deliberation (multiple testimonies, one verdict)
- Candidate 5: Archaeological Excavation (multiple dig sites, one reconstructed artifact)
- **Score: 3 (HIGH)** -- 5+ candidates

**RICHNESS = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27** (maximum possible)

### Secondary Tension: RECONCILE vs. KortAI System

The content makes paradigm claims ("layout as content, not container"; "components are characters"). The reader must reconcile these with existing assumptions. The system's decisive personality could present these as VERDICTS (here is the truth) rather than INVITATIONS (consider whether this changes your thinking).

**Richness: Opposition 2 x Overlap 2 x Width 2 = 8** (below primary but genuine)

### Tension Selection

**PRIMARY: UNDERSTAND+DISCOVER (richness 27)**
**SECONDARY: RECONCILE (richness 8, compounds with primary)**

The primary tension is the DISTILLATION story: 337 findings compressed through 5 research streams into 5 principles. The page must make the reader EXPERIENCE this compression -- not describe it, ENACT it. The secondary tension enriches this: the principles that emerge from distillation are paradigm-challenging, and the page must hold space for reconciliation.

## Part 4: TC Phase 3 -- Metaphor Collapse

### Step 3.1: Structural Properties from Side A (Reader Needs)

| Emotional Need | Structural Property |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Progressive distillation | CONVERGENCE (many inputs narrowing to few outputs) |
| Earned revelation | STRATIFICATION (layers of increasing refinement) |
| Provenance tracking | ATTRIBUTION (visible connection from source to output) |
| Paradigm reconciliation | JUXTAPOSITION (old understanding alongside new) |
| Authority through evidence | ACCUMULATION (weight builds through aggregation) |

### Step 3.2: Structural Properties from Side B (System Constraints)

| System Constraint | Structural Property |
|------------------|-------------------|
| border-radius: 0 | ANGULARITY |
| box-shadow: none | FLATNESS |
| Border categories (1px, 3px, 4px) | DISCRETE WEIGHT |
| Spacing scale | PRECISE INTERVALS |
| Limited palette | NARROW TEMPERATURE RANGE |
| 75% austere + 85% serious | FORMAL BEARING |

### Step 3.3: Structural Overlap

**Shared properties (Side A AND Side B):**
1. STRATIFICATION / DISCRETE WEIGHT -- both organize through levels
2. ACCUMULATION / PRECISE INTERVALS -- both build through measured increments
3. CONVERGENCE / ANGULARITY -- both can narrow sharply (funnel shape is angular)
4. ATTRIBUTION / FORMAL BEARING -- both take evidence seriously

**Overlap percentage:** 4 shared / 11 total unique = 36% (IDEAL ZONE for metaphor potential)

### Step 3.4: Search Query

> "What real-world domain naturally exhibits STRATIFICATION, CONVERGENCE, and ACCUMULATION while being ANGULAR and FLAT, yet conveying EARNED REVELATION and PROGRESSIVE DISTILLATION?"

### Three Search Heuristics

**1. Constraint scan (hardest first: ANGULARITY):**
Eliminates: organic/biological, liquid/fluid, atmospheric, textile, botanical.
Survives: geological, architectural, typographic, cartographic, industrial, scientific, legal, archival.

**2. Content resonance (what is the content LITERALLY about?):**
The content is literally about SYNTHESIS -- five independent research streams being REFINED into unified principles. The vocabulary is: "synthesis," "unified," "distilled," "cross-research," "converge." This points toward: refinery/distillation, assay/testing, cartographic survey, editorial synthesis.

**3. Emotional valence:**
Earned authority, confidence through evidence, progressive clarity. Eliminates: military (aggressive), medical (clinical). Survives: scientific, editorial, cartographic, archival, geological.

### Candidate Metaphors

**Candidate A: Assay Laboratory**
Five ore samples (research streams) are tested, measured, and their common mineral (design principles) is extracted. The assay process IS distillation: raw material goes in, refined understanding comes out. The laboratory is angular (equipment, measurement instruments), flat (work surfaces, sample trays), and formal (precise methodology).

**Candidate B: Cartographic Survey**
Five survey expeditions map different terrain. Their overlapping observations produce a unified map -- the synthesis. The map is angular (grid lines, coordinates), flat (2D projection), and authoritative (measured, verified). The reader traces from field notes to finished map.

**Candidate C: Editorial Press**
Five reporters file stories from different beats. An editorial process distills their reporting into a single authoritative edition. The press is angular (column grids, layout rules), flat (printed page), and formal (editorial standards). The reader experiences the editorial voice that emerges from multiple sources.

**Candidate D: Geological Assay Core**
Already used by OD-004 in the design system. REJECTED per stale tension rule.

**Candidate E: Crystallization Chamber**
A supersaturated solution (337 findings) slowly precipitates crystals (5 principles) as conditions change. The crystal structure is angular (lattice geometry), flat at any cross-section, and precise (molecular-level ordering). HOWEVER: crystallization is primarily organic/growth metaphor territory. The process itself (nucleation, precipitation) requires conceptual vocabulary that conflicts with angularity at the macro level.

### Step 3.5: Composite Scoring

---

#### CANDIDATE A: Assay Laboratory

**A. Tension Resolution:**
| Tension | Resolves? | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| UNDERSTAND convergence topology | YES (1) | Assay process naturally shows many-samples -> few-results |
| DISCOVER earned revelation | YES (1) | Assay results are EARNED through process, not declared |
| FEEL progressive distillation | YES (1) | Raw ore -> crushed -> separated -> refined = progressive |
| RECONCILE paradigm shift | PARTIAL (0.5) | Assay reveals what was ALWAYS in the ore -- paradigm shift is more moderate |
| **Score: 3.5/4** | | |

**B. Structural Isomorphism Count:**
| Metaphor Property | Content Property | System Mechanism |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Five ore samples from different sources | Five research streams (R-1 through R-5) | Five distinct zone backgrounds or bordered sections |
| Crushing/grinding (size reduction) | 337 findings summarized to key insights | Compression: decreasing padding, increasing density |
| Separation (pan, centrifuge) | Cross-research comparison, conflict resolution | Side-by-side layout, juxtaposition |
| Assay report (quantified results) | Five unified principles | Strong-bordered, confident-typography output sections |
| Reagent test (binary: contains mineral or not) | Addition Test (genuine or cosmetic) | Binary visual signals: present/absent, pass/fail |
| Progressive refinement stages | Raw findings -> principles -> actionable top 10 | Spatial progression: sparse-to-dense-to-sparse |
| Laboratory precision | KortAI editorial precision | Mono-font labels, mathematical spacing |
| Sample identification tags | Research stream attribution (R-1 + R-3) | Meta-font labels on principle sections |
| **Isomorphism Count: 8** | (Structurally isomorphic) | |

**C. Content Resonance:**
- C1 Nominal: MEDIUM -- content uses "synthesis," "unified," "distilled" which parallel assay vocabulary but don't literally use it
- C2 Structural: HIGH -- the assay process (many raw inputs -> few refined outputs) is ISOMORPHIC to the content's structure (337 findings -> 5 principles)

**D. Mechanism Feasibility:** 100% -- all properties expressible through zone backgrounds, border weight, typography, spacing, layout, color accent.

**E. Perceptual Risk Assessment:**
| Risk Question | Rating | Score |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Transition model: CHANGING STATE (crushed -> separated -> refined) | LOW | 0 |
| Expression mode: STRUCTURAL GRADIENTS (increasing refinement = increasing visual clarity/confidence) | LOW | 0 |
| Element variety: VARIED (ore samples look different from reagent tests from assay reports) | LOW | 0 |
| Responsive story: Laboratory narrows naturally (smaller bench, stacked instruments) | LOW | 0 |
| **Perceptual Risk Score: 0 (LOW RISK)** | | |

**F. Perceptual Cost Assessment:**
| Cost Question | Answer | Cost |
|--------------|--------|------|
| Compression below floors? | No -- refinement uses background/weight shifts, not extreme compression | 0 |
| Container width below minimum? | No -- laboratory bench is wide, not narrow | 0 |
| Uniform element grids? | No -- assay stages produce differently-shaped outputs | 0 |
| Transitions as empty space? | No -- transitions are PROCESS STAGES (state changes) | 0 |
| Explicit labels over structure? | Moderate risk -- "SAMPLE," "REAGENT," "ASSAY REPORT" could over-label | +1 |
| **Perceptual Cost Score: 1 (LOW)** | | |

---

#### CANDIDATE B: Cartographic Survey

**A. Tension Resolution:**
| Tension | Resolves? | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| UNDERSTAND convergence topology | YES (1) | Five survey expeditions converging to one unified map |
| DISCOVER earned revelation | PARTIAL (0.5) | Maps are PUBLISHED, not discovered. Discovery is in the field, not at the map |
| FEEL progressive distillation | PARTIAL (0.5) | Maps are assembled, not distilled. Assembly differs from distillation |
| RECONCILE paradigm shift | NO (0) | Maps confirm territory, they don't challenge assumptions |
| **Score: 2/4** | | |

**B. Structural Isomorphism Count: 5** (adequate but less deep than Assay)

**E. Perceptual Risk Score: 1 (LOW)**
One flag: transition model risks empty space (terrain between survey sites).

**Verdict: CONSIDER but weaker than Assay on resolution.**

---

#### CANDIDATE C: Editorial Press

**A. Tension Resolution:**
| Tension | Resolves? | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| UNDERSTAND convergence topology | YES (1) | Five reporters -> one edition |
| DISCOVER earned revelation | PARTIAL (0.5) | Editorial voice is DECLARED, not progressively earned |
| FEEL progressive distillation | YES (1) | Raw notes -> drafts -> edited copy -> published = progressive |
| RECONCILE paradigm shift | PARTIAL (0.5) | Editorials can challenge, but the press metaphor leans toward reportage |
| **Score: 3/4** | | |

**B. Structural Isomorphism Count: 6** (strong)

**E. Perceptual Risk Score: 0.5 (LOW)**

**Verdict: CONSIDER. Strong but the editorial metaphor's vocabulary overlaps with CD-006 (which already uses editorial approach). Risk of convergence with library.**

---

### Step 3.5G: 6-Criterion Metaphor Quality Rubric

#### CANDIDATE A: Assay Laboratory

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **1. Interpretive Distance** | **2/3** | Assay is an analogous domain -- not literally what the content describes (it's not about chemistry) but structurally apt (many samples -> few results). Not the content's own vocabulary. Not impenetrably abstract. |
| **2. Content-Shape Fit** | **3/3** | The assay process shape (funnel: many inputs -> few outputs, with progressive refinement stages) IS the content's shape (337 findings -> 5 principles, through synthesis stages). |
| **3. Structural Survival** | **3/3** | Remove all labels: the page still shows dense/varied input zones being progressively refined into clean/authoritative output zones. The background graduation, density shift, and border-weight progression communicate "refinement" without a single label. |
| **4. Perceptual Risk** | **3/3** | 0 perceptual risk flags. |
| **5. Mechanism Diversity** | **3/3** | All 6 channels activated: backgrounds (zone progression), borders (weight gradient from raw to refined), typography (mono-tags -> serif principles -> body application), spacing (compression gradient), layout (grid inputs -> single-column outputs), accent (red for structural emphasis at key findings). |
| **6. Restraint Compatibility** | **2/3** | 2-3 mechanisms per viewport naturally. The "raw material" sections may push toward 4 but this is manageable through density variation. |
| **TOTAL: 16/18** | **STRONG METAPHOR** | |

**Interpretive Distance check: 2 >= 2. PASSES mandatory threshold.**

### 6 Binary Rejection Checks

| # | Check | Result | Reasoning |
|---|-------|--------|-----------|
| R1 | Uses content's own domain vocabulary? | **NO (PASS)** | Content is about design research synthesis, not about assaying or chemistry. The metaphor introduces NEW vocabulary. |
| R2 | Requires visible text labels to communicate? | **NO (PASS)** | The progression from dense/varied/raw input zones to clean/authoritative/refined output zones communicates structurally through background, border weight, density, and typography shifts. |
| R3 | Forces container width below 940px? | **NO (PASS)** | A laboratory bench is WIDE. No conceptual pressure toward narrow containers. |
| R4 | ALL transitions as empty space? | **NO (PASS)** | Transitions are PROCESS STAGES: crushing, separating, testing, reporting. Each stage is a state change, not empty space. |
| R5 | 6+ identical repeated elements? | **NO (PASS)** | Five research streams are DIFFERENT samples (different colors, different compositions). Five principles are DIFFERENT assay results. Variation is inherent. |
| R6 | Requires soul violations? | **NO (PASS)** | Angular equipment, flat work surfaces, sharp instruments. Laboratory aesthetic aligns perfectly with border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none. |

**ALL 6 PASS. No rejection.**

---

### SELECTED METAPHOR: Assay Laboratory

**The page is an assay laboratory where five raw ore samples (research streams) are progressively refined through testing, separation, and analysis into five confirmed mineral compositions (design principles).**

**Why it won:**
- Highest tension resolution (3.5/4) -- resolves all four primary tensions
- Highest isomorphism count (8) -- structurally isomorphic, not merely analogous
- Structural survival 3/3 -- the refinement gradient communicates without labels
- Zero perceptual risk -- transitions are state changes, elements are varied, responsive story is natural
- 16/18 on quality rubric (STRONG METAPHOR)
- Interpretive distance 2/3 -- analogous domain, not literal, not impenetrable

**What it DOESN'T resolve:**
- RECONCILE tension gets 0.5/1, not 1/1. The assay laboratory reveals what's IN the ore but doesn't challenge assumptions about what ore IS. The paradigm-challenging aspect of "layout as content, not container" will need to be carried by content juxtaposition and the CONFLICT RESOLUTION sections, not by the metaphor's structure alone. This is an honest gap.

**Why alternatives were rejected:**
- Cartographic Survey: 2/4 tension resolution. Maps are assembled, not distilled -- misses the progressive refinement that IS the content's story.
- Editorial Press: 3/4 tension resolution, strong, but vocabulary overlaps with CD-006's editorial approach. Risk of convergence with library. Also, editorial voice is declared, not progressively earned.
- Geological Core: Already used by OD-004. Stale tension.
- Crystallization: Organic growth metaphor conflicts with angularity at macro level.

## Part 5: Structural Test (MG-04)

**Remove all labels and titles from the mental model. Does the visual structure alone communicate the metaphor?**

The page opens with five distinct, dense, visually varied input zones (different background tints, different border accents, different content densities). These represent the five research streams. As the reader scrolls, these varied inputs CONVERGE: zones become fewer, wider, more uniform. The typography shifts from mono-heavy (data, findings) to serif-italic (principles, conclusions). Background colors move from varied warm/neutral mixes to a clean, confident palette. Border weights shift from 1px separators (raw data) to 4px structural (established principles). Spacing opens up as content becomes more refined.

Without a single label, the reader EXPERIENCES: chaotic variety -> progressive simplification -> confident clarity.

**YES, the visual structure communicates the metaphor. PROCEED.**

---

## Part 6: Channel Map (CP-F Format)

### Ch1 (Chromatic): How Color Encodes the Metaphor

**Raw material zones** (research stream sections): Varied, warm backgrounds. Each stream gets a subtly different zone tint -- one uses `var(--color-zone-breathing)` (#FAF5ED), another uses `var(--color-zone-dense)` (#FFFFFF), another uses a subtle warm tint. Visual variety = unrefined, many-sourced.

**Refinement zones** (principle sections): Converging toward the clean cream palette. All principles share the same background (`var(--color-zone-sparse)` #FEF9F5). Visual uniformity = refined, unified.

**Bedrock zone** (master insight, conflict resolutions): Dark header/footer bookends (#1A1A1A). The deepest analysis zone. Inverted palette = the furnace where synthesis happens.

**PRIMARY CHANNEL: YES.** Color progression from variety to uniformity IS the distillation gradient.

### Ch2 (Typographic): How Type Encodes the Metaphor

**Raw material:** `var(--font-mono)` dominates (research stream identifiers: R-1, R-3, finding counts, data tables). Mono = raw measurement, precision, unprocessed.

**Refinement:** `var(--font-body)` Inter dominates (principle explanations, implementation guidance). Body = processed analysis, readable understanding.

**Distilled output:** `var(--font-display)` Instrument Serif for principle titles and the master insight. Serif = the refined product -- confident, authoritative, final.

The typography progression (mono -> sans -> serif) mirrors the content's progression (raw findings -> analysis -> settled principles).

**PRIMARY CHANNEL: YES.** Font family shift IS the refinement arc.

### Ch3 (Spatial): How Spacing Encodes the Metaphor

**Raw material zones:** Tighter spacing (`var(--space-4)` to `var(--space-6)` internal padding). Dense with findings. Multiple items per viewport. Information-rich, compressed.

**Principle zones:** Generous spacing (`var(--space-8)` to `var(--space-12)`). One concept per viewport. Breathing room = refined clarity.

**Action zones** (top 10): Medium spacing. Practical, actionable density -- neither raw nor philosophical.

Spacing gradient: tight (raw) -> generous (principles) -> medium (application). This is NOT linear (which would be monotonous) but a PULSE: dense-sparse-dense-sparse mapping to the content's own rhythm.

**PRIMARY CHANNEL: YES.** Spacing compression gradient IS the density-as-rhythm principle, DEMONSTRATED in the page about density-as-rhythm.

### Ch4 (Structural): How Borders/Dividers Encode the Metaphor

**Raw material sections:** 1px borders (data separators between findings, thin containment). Light weight = preliminary, unconfirmed.

**Principle sections:** 4px left borders (structural, confident). Heavy weight = established, refined.

**Conflict resolution zones:** 3px borders (structural but dialogic -- holding two sides). Medium weight = resolution in progress.

Border weight gradient: 1px (raw) -> 3px (resolving) -> 4px (established). This mirrors the content's confidence gradient: findings (uncertain) -> conflicts (debated) -> principles (settled).

**SECONDARY CHANNEL.** Border weight gradient supports the refinement arc but doesn't carry it alone.

### Ch5 (Density): How Content Density Encodes the Metaphor

**Research stream inputs:** DENSE. Multiple findings per section, tables, lists. High information per viewport area. Raw material is voluminous.

**Principles:** MODERATE to SPARSE. One principle per section. Generous whitespace. The distilled product is concentrated but given room.

**Master insight:** MINIMAL. A single sentence. Maximum clarity. The most refined output occupies the least space.

The density progression mirrors the content's compression ratio: 337 findings (dense) -> 5 principles (moderate) -> 1 master insight (sparse). The PAGE demonstrates "density as rhythm" through its own reading experience.

**PRIMARY CHANNEL: YES.** The page's density gradient IS the distillation process, and it simultaneously DEMONSTRATES Principle 1 (Density as Rhythm).

### Ch6 (Rhythmic): How Repetition/Alternation Encodes the Metaphor

**Research input section:** PULSE rhythm. Five varied blocks in rapid succession (one per stream). Visually heterogeneous. The rhythm is: sample-sample-sample-sample-sample -- five distinct beats.

**Synthesis section:** CRESCENDO rhythm. Principles build from specific to general. Each principle adds to the unified framework. The rhythm is: principle-integration-principle-integration-principle-integration.

**Application section:** BOOKEND rhythm. Top 10 findings bracketed by opening context and closing anti-patterns. Practical, contained.

Three distinct rhythmic modes across the page = three distinct transition types = rhythm variation requirement MET.

**SECONDARY CHANNEL.** Rhythmic variation supports engagement but isn't the primary metaphor carrier.

### Ch7 (Intentional): What Compositional Intelligence Means for This Metaphor

The page must demonstrate COMPOSITIONAL INTELLIGENCE by making the reader EXPERIENCE the synthesis process, not merely READ about it. Specifically:

- The five research streams should FEEL different from each other (varied density, different accents, different content shapes) in the opening sections
- The principles should FEEL unified (convergent palette, shared structure, consistent typography) in the middle sections
- The transition from variety to unity should be GRADUAL, not abrupt -- the reader should notice convergence accumulating
- The conflict resolutions should FEEL like moments of increased pressure (deeper backgrounds, heavier borders) before resolution

The compositional intelligence is: **the form enacts the content's argument**. The page ABOUT distillation IS a distillation experience.

### Primary Channels Summary

| Channel | Role | Weight |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Ch1 (Chromatic)** | PRIMARY | Variety-to-uniformity gradient carries the distillation arc |
| **Ch2 (Typographic)** | PRIMARY | Mono-to-serif progression mirrors raw-to-refined |
| **Ch3 (Spatial)** | PRIMARY | Compression gradient demonstrates density-as-rhythm |

## Part 7: Spatial Cost Estimate (MG-05)

### Estimated Page Structure

| Section | Est. Height (1440px) | Metaphor Structural Cost | Content Cost |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Header (dark, inverted) | ~200px | 0% (standard landmark) | Title + subtitle |
| Research Streams Overview (5 input blocks) | ~800px | ~200px (varied zone backgrounds + accent borders) = 25% | Executive summary + stream summaries |
| Transition: Streams -> Principles | ~100px | ~100px (bridge transition) = 100% | Minimal |
| Five Principles (5 sections) | ~2400px | ~300px (border-weight shifts + zone backgrounds + typography progression) = 12.5% | Principle text + tables + implementation |
| Transition: Principles -> Conflicts | ~100px | ~80px (breathing transition) = 80% | Minimal |
| Conflict Resolutions (3 pairs) | ~600px | ~100px (juxtaposition zones) = 16.7% | Three conflict/resolution pairs |
| Transition: Conflicts -> Application | ~80px | ~60px (smooth transition) = 75% | Minimal |
| Showcase Architecture + Actions | ~800px | ~100px (density shift to reference mode) = 12.5% | Matrix + top 10 + anti-patterns |
| Footer (dark, mirrors header) | ~120px | 0% (standard landmark) | Meta info |
| **TOTAL** | **~5200px** | **~940px = 18.1%** | |

### MG-05 Check: Metaphor spatial cost <= 15%?

**Estimated at 18.1% -- slightly above the 15% threshold.**

**Mitigation:** The three transition zones (280px combined) can be reduced. Bridge transition can be reduced from 100px to 64px. Breathing can go from 80px to 64px. Smooth from 80px to 48px. Revised: 176px transitions. New total metaphor cost: ~836px / 5056px = **16.5%**.

Further mitigation: The research streams overview can be more compact -- 5 blocks at 130px each instead of 160px = 650px instead of 800px, saving 150px of metaphor cost. New total: ~686px / 4906px = **14.0%**.

**With these mitigations: 14.0% -- PASSES MG-05.**

The key principle: the metaphor's structural costs are distributed across the ENTIRE page as subtle shifts in background, border weight, and typography. The only metaphor-ONLY elements are the transitions between major sections. Everything else serves double duty as both content presentation AND metaphor expression.

## Metaphor Commitment (Phase 3.5 Lock-In)

### Step 3.5A: Committed Metaphor

**ASSAY LABORATORY: The page is a laboratory where five raw ore samples (research streams) are progressively refined through testing and analysis into five confirmed mineral compositions (design principles).**

### Step 3.5B: Why This Metaphor

**How it resolves the tension:**
The assay laboratory creates a STRUCTURAL BRIDGE between the reader's need for progressive distillation (DISCOVER axis) and the system's flat, angular, precise vocabulary. A laboratory is naturally angular (equipment, measurement instruments, work surfaces), flat (sample trays, observation surfaces), and precise (quantified results) -- matching KortAI's personality. Yet the PROCESS of assaying is inherently about earned revelation: you test, separate, analyze, and THEN know what the sample contains. The result is earned through methodology, not declared.

**Why this metaphor vs. alternatives:**
- vs. Cartographic Survey: Maps are assembled from observations, not distilled through refinement. The survey metaphor misses the PROGRESSIVE aspect -- you don't refine a map, you assemble it. The content's story is distillation (lossy compression with quality gain), not assembly (additive aggregation).
- vs. Editorial Press: Strong structural match but too close to CD-006's editorial approach. Also, editorial authority is DECLARED by the editor's voice, while the content's authority is EARNED through evidence accumulation. The assay laboratory preserves the evidence-first, conclusion-second ordering.

### Step 3.5C: Commitment Verification

1. **Did I derive this metaphor independently?** YES -- I ran the full Phase 1-2 pipeline before considering candidates.
2. **Can I justify this metaphor without referencing library examples?** YES -- the justification traces from content tension (337->5 distillation) through structural overlap (layering, ordering, convergence) to the search query that produced the laboratory domain.
3. **Does this metaphor appear in /case-studies/_INDEX.md?** I have not read the case study index. The assay laboratory is not a metaphor used in any of the existing explorations (DD, OD, AD, CD) that I studied.

## Summary for Downstream Agents

### The Metaphor in One Sentence
The page enacts the distillation of 337 scattered research findings into 5 unified principles by making the reader EXPERIENCE progressive refinement: visually varied, dense, multi-source input zones converge through process stages into clean, unified, authoritative output zones.

### Builder Warnings
- **W-IMPLICIT (MANDATORY):** The assay laboratory must be FELT, never LABELED. No visible text should say "sample," "reagent," "assay." The refinement is communicated through background convergence, typography shift, border weight progression, and density gradient. If you find yourself writing a label like "STAGE 2: SEPARATION," you are announcing, not embodying.
- **W-DEADZONE:** Transition zones between stages must be PROCESS-STATE CHANGES (background color shift + border weight change), NOT empty space. Maximum breathing zone: 48px.
- **W-STATS:** If implementing a research stream summary strip, limit to 3 metadata items at 768px.

### Key Isomorphisms for Builders

| Metaphor Property | Content Property | Primary CSS Channel |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Five different ore samples | Five research streams (R-1 through R-5) | Zone backgrounds (varied tints) + border accents |
| Crushing (size reduction) | 337 findings summarized | Compression (decreasing padding, increasing density) |
| Separation (sorting) | Cross-research comparison | Side-by-side layout, juxtaposition zones |
| Assay report (quantified results) | Five unified principles | Serif typography, 4px borders, confident spacing |
| Reagent test (pass/fail) | Addition Test, BECAUSE test | Binary visual signals (present/absent) |
| Progressive refinement stages | Raw -> synthesis -> application | Background/typography/spacing gradient across page |
| Laboratory precision | KortAI editorial precision | Mono-font labels, mathematical spacing |
| Sample identification tags | Research stream attribution | Meta-font labels (R-1, R-3, etc.) |

### Channel Deployment Priority
1. **Chromatic** -- Variety-to-uniformity zone background gradient (PRIMARY)
2. **Typographic** -- Mono -> Sans -> Serif progression (PRIMARY)
3. **Spatial** -- Compression gradient mirroring density rhythm (PRIMARY)
4. **Density** -- Content density mirroring 337->5->1 compression (PRIMARY)
5. **Structural** -- Border weight 1px->3px->4px confidence gradient (SECONDARY)
6. **Rhythmic** -- PULSE/CRESCENDO/BOOKEND three-mode variety (SECONDARY)

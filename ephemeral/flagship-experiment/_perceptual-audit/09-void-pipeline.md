## Per-Viewport Analysis

**VP01 (scroll 0px)**
- Content %: ~65%
- Blank %: ~35%
- Notes: Dark hero header occupies top ~30% of viewport (fully filled, black background with title and subtitle). Below header, a clear white/cream transition zone with section label and "What the Research Set Out to Find" heading begins. A drop cap "F" leads into dense body text. The below-header gap is intentional breathing room (~80px), not a void. The lower 40% is dense prose. Blank band is transition-appropriate, not catastrophic.

**VP02 (scroll 1400px)**
- Content %: ~55%
- Blank %: ~45%
- Notes: Top third shows a large pull-quote block with left border (visually anchored). Below the quote block, a substantial blank cream zone (~280px estimated), then a thin horizontal rule, then a bridge paragraph in italic, then another significant gap before Section 03 heading and body prose begin at the bottom quarter. This is the most concerning viewport. The middle band between the pull quote and section divider is largely empty. Estimated blank band: ~350-400px contiguous, which is less than a full viewport but visually noticeable. Does NOT cross the 70% threshold.

**VP03 (scroll 2800px)**
- Content %: ~70%
- Blank %: ~30%
- Notes: "DENSITY RHYTHM" labeled section with left accent border, two dense prose paragraphs. Below prose, a whitespace gap (~200px), then a thin horizontal rule spanning full width. Below rule, another ~180px gap, then Section 04 header and first body paragraph begin at bottom. Blank zone between sections is ~380px total but split by the rule. Feels like intentional section breathing, not a void.

**VP04 (scroll 4200px)**
- Content %: ~65%
- Blank %: ~35%
- Notes: Top shows a two-column table with "Bookends / Context-Action-Summary structures" and "PULSE / Tutorials, learning journeys" rows. Followed by a body paragraph. Then a blank gap (~200px), horizontal rule, blank gap, then an italic bridge paragraph in lighter gray. Then Section 05 heading and dense body prose begins. Pattern mirrors VP03: section-to-section transition whitespace is consistent and moderate.

**VP05 (scroll 5600px)**
- Content %: ~80%
- Blank %: ~20%
- Notes: Table rows showing velocity/temperature/weight component properties (Decision Matrix, Core Abstraction, Task Component, Reasoning). Then "COMBINATION RULE" labeled callout with body text. Then a blank gap (~200px), horizontal rule, blank gap (~100px). Then Section 06 header and first prose paragraph begins. High content density overall. This is the strongest viewport in terms of fill ratio.

**VP06 (scroll 7000px)**
- Content %: ~75%
- Blank %: ~25%
- Notes: Section 07 "Three Tensions and How to Resolve Them" with dense prose, then two labeled callout blocks with left red borders (TENSION — GRID VS. PRECISION and its RESOLUTION), then a second TENSION callout (DISCLOSURE VS. FLATNESS) and its RESOLUTION beginning. Multiple vertical-accent-bordered blocks create strong visual structure. Excellent engagement density. No void concern.

**VP07 (scroll 8400px)**
- Content %: ~65%
- Blank %: ~35%
- Notes: Top shows a thin horizontal rule and a blank gap (~80px), then an italic bridge paragraph ("Tensions resolved..."), then Section 08 "From Principles to Page Structure" heading, prose, and a large data table (Section Type / Primary Axis / Density Rhythm / Temperature Flow / Research Sources). Table has 7 rows and fills the lower 40% of the viewport. Visual engagement is maintained. The top blank zone is modest and section-transition appropriate.

**VP08 (scroll 9800px)**
- Content %: ~85%
- Blank %: ~15%
- Notes: Dark background blocks (three labeled sequence cards: TEACHING SEQUENCE — EXPLAIN CONCEPT, DECISION SEQUENCE — GUIDE CHOICE, CLOSING SEQUENCE — RESOLVE AND RELEASE), each with arrow-prefixed line items. These dark blocks fill almost the entire viewport. Then a blank cream gap (~180px), horizontal rule, blank gap (~80px), and an italic bridge sentence begins. This is the DENSEST viewport in the entire page. Essentially zero void concern.

**VP09 (scroll 11200px)**
- Content %: ~75%
- Blank %: ~25%
- Notes: Top shows remaining rows of a numbered rules table (rows 04-10: "24px between related...", "Z-pattern for hero...", "Never stack same-velocity...", etc.). Then blank gap (~200px), horizontal rule, blank gap, then Section 10 "What to Avoid and Why" heading and a two-column anti-pattern table begins at bottom (rows 01 and 02 visible). Transition whitespace consistent with rest of page.

**VP10 (scroll 12600px)**
- Content %: ~90%
- Blank %: ~10%
- Notes: Dense table content — "Density Explorations" section with hypothesis/what-it-tests two-column table (5 rows), then "Axis Explorations" section header and another hypothesis table (5 rows visible). Almost no blank space. This is a data-dense section and it shows. Strong engagement throughout.

**VP11 (scroll 14000px)**
- Content %: ~70%
- Blank %: ~30%
- Notes: Top thin rule, blank gap (~80px), italic bridge paragraph ("Fifteen hypotheses..."), blank gap, then Section 12 "An Invitation, Not a Conclusion" heading, followed by three dense prose paragraphs filling the lower ~55% of the viewport. Standard section-open breathing room at top, content-rich bottom. No void concern.

## Contiguous Void Assessment

**Longest single void stretch identified:** VP02, the transition zone between the pull quote block and the Section 03 divider. Estimated at approximately 350-400px of cream space containing only a thin horizontal rule (which is a 1px line, essentially invisible at scroll speed). This is the worst void candidate on the page.

**Does any viewport exceed 70% blank?** NO. The highest blank estimate is VP02 at ~45%. No viewport approaches the 70% threshold.

**Are there 2+ consecutive viewports where >50% is blank?** NO. VP02 is the single high-blank outlier at ~45%, and it does not cross 50%. No consecutive pair is problematic.

**Does any contiguous void exceed 1620px (one full viewport)?** NO. The between-section whitespace pattern is consistent throughout: approximately 80-120px gap + thin horizontal rule + 80-120px gap + italic bridge paragraph. The total contiguous cream zone including all elements in a typical section transition is approximately 400-500px, well under the 1620px threshold.

**Section transition anatomy (recurring pattern throughout page):**
```
[Content block end]
~100px blank gap
[thin horizontal rule, full width]
~100px blank gap
[italic bridge paragraph, ~3 lines]
~80px blank gap
[Section ## label in small caps]
[Section heading]
[Body content]
```
Total transition height: approximately 500-600px. This is intentional density rhythm — it is the LOW density moment between HIGH density sections. It is design, not failure.

**Bottom 30% of page (before footer):** VP11 and the final section show Section 12 prose content and presumably a footer region. No void detected in the terminal section. The page ends with substantive prose, not trailing emptiness.

## Comparison to Ceiling Experiment

The ceiling experiment failure was characterized by:
- 70-80% of total scroll length being blank cream
- Large decorative zones with no text, tables, or visual treatments
- Multiple consecutive viewports that were nearly entirely empty
- Voids that lasted well over 1620px (multiple viewport heights) in succession

This flagship experiment is categorically different:

| Dimension | Ceiling Experiment | Flagship Experiment |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Max blank % in any viewport | ~80% | ~45% (VP02) |
| Viewports exceeding 70% blank | Multiple (majority) | Zero |
| Consecutive 50%+ blank viewports | Yes (multiple pairs) | Zero |
| Longest contiguous void | Multiple viewport-heights | ~400px (0.29x viewport) |
| Overall impression | Scrolling through emptiness | Reading through content with breath |
| Design vs defect | Defect — unintentional emptiness | Design — intentional section rhythm |

The flagship page maintains consistent visual engagement throughout all 11 viewports. The between-section transitions are deliberate density-LOW moments following the density-HIGH content sections. They are approximately 400-600px in height and serve a clear typographic function (section separation + bridge narration). They do not constitute voids.

The strongest comparison point: in the ceiling experiment, 9/9 auditors independently flagged the whitespace as the dominant defect. In this flagship experiment, the most "empty" viewport (VP02 at ~45% blank) is still more than half filled, and the blank portion is occupied by a clearly structured pull-quote block plus a section transition zone. There is nothing here analogous to the ceiling experiment's catastrophic emptiness.

## Verdict

**VOID-FREE**

No catastrophic whitespace voids detected. The page successfully implements density rhythm — alternating between HIGH density content sections and LOW density section transitions — as a deliberate design mechanism. The between-section breathing room is consistent, predictable, and typographically purposeful. No single viewport exceeds 50% blank space. No contiguous void exceeds 1620px. No consecutive viewports share high blank ratios. The bottom of the page terminates in substantive content.

The previous ceiling experiment failure (70-80% scroll as blank cream, flagged by all 9 auditors) is NOT reproduced here. This flagship page passes the void audit by a wide margin.

**Confidence:** HIGH. All 11 viewports inspected individually. Full-page overview confirms no hidden void zones between inspected scroll positions.

**One minor flag (not a defect):** VP02's transition zone (~45% blank) is the highest blank ratio in the page. If the pull-quote block were smaller or if the bridge paragraph were removed, this could trend toward a 50% blank viewport. As-is, it is acceptable within density rhythm design. Recommend monitoring if content is edited to shorten the pull-quote block.

# AD Explorations -- Creative Orchestration Across Windows

How 9 AD files create different thinking states in different windows,
and why only 2 of them matter.

**Total Corpus:** 9 files, 5,101 lines
**Core Finding:** The AD corpus is 75% administrative infrastructure.
Only 2 files create the processing state that enables compositional thinking.
The orchestration is an act of aggressive curation, not comprehensive loading.

## The Orchestration Logic

AD discovered that axis geometry IS density IS organization -- three names
for one phenomenon. This is the most philosophically significant finding in
the design system. But the 9-file corpus that produced this finding is
mostly PROCESS RECORDS (gate checklists, convention specifications, fix
guides, navigation files).

The creative intelligence of AD lives in exactly two files:

**AD-SYNTHESIS.md** -- the conceptual framework (3-way unification,
equivalence mechanisms, "the soul constraint is generative")

**AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md** -- the perceptual reasoning (WHY constraints
exist, told through the stories of what 12+ independent auditors SAW)

Everything else is pipeline infrastructure. Loading infrastructure into
creative windows reproduces the guardrail-factory failure mode: specification
contaminating composition.

## The Two Files That Matter

### AD-SYNTHESIS.md (306 lines) -- Conceptual Framework

This file creates INTELLECTUAL COHERENCE. Reading it, you feel the click
of a conceptual puzzle assembling: Z-sweep IS PULSE. Grid cells ARE islands.
Direction change IS state change. The unification builds from individual
discoveries to the meta-equivalence (ATTENTION TOPOLOGY), and the reader
experiences the unification happening across the reading.

After this file, axis design stops being "layout choices" and becomes "how
content arrangement shapes attention flow." The soul constraint stops being
a limitation and becomes a generator: "border-radius: 0 forced the angular
spiral approximation, which IS geological stratification. Without the
constraint, the spiral would have been a generic Fibonacci curve."

**Why it belongs in Window 1 (TC Derivation):**
TC benefits from the philosophical framing. "Axis IS density expressed
spatially" helps TC understand that choosing a page's spatial structure is
not a separate decision from choosing its density pattern. They are one
decision viewed from two angles. This collapses the TC's decision space:
instead of making two independent choices (axis pattern AND density pattern),
TC makes one choice that expresses itself in both vocabularies.

**Why it belongs in Window 4 (Refinement):**
The refiner benefits from the diagnostic vocabulary. The transition grammar
(SMOOTH/BRIDGE/BREATHING) and the 5-mechanism equivalence model give the
refiner precise language for diagnosing axis-density coherence: "The Z-to-F
transition uses BRIDGE spacing but the density shift is SMOOTH -- this
mismatch creates cognitive dissonance."

### AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md (970 lines) -- Perceptual Evidence

This file creates PERCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING. It is 970 lines of WHY -- not
"container width should be 1100px" but "12+ independent auditors across 6
pages called 860px 'cramped.' The user intervened directly: 'WHY IS THE WIDTH
SO NARROW ON ALL OF THESE.'" Each convention becomes a STORY about human
perception, not a rule about CSS values.

This is the highest-creative-autonomy file in the entire AD corpus. It
teaches the REASONING behind constraints, which enables the reader to make
NEW decisions consistent with the principles. A builder who reads "the 860px
container left 40% unused cream margins" understands container width as a
perceptual relationship, not as a number to memorize.

**Why it belongs in Window 1 (TC Derivation):**
TC benefits from the perceptual reasoning because it grounds design
philosophy in evidence. "Perceptual evidence from 12+ independent observers"
is a different epistemic category than "we decided this." TC that absorbs this
file derives RICHER tension because it understands that design decisions are
responses to perceptual reality, not arbitrary choices.

**Why it belongs in Window 4 (Refinement):**
The refiner benefits from the perceptual calibration. Understanding what
"cramped" LOOKS LIKE (40% unused cream margins at 860px), what "dead space"
FEELS LIKE ("approximately FOUR consecutive screens of nothing"), what
"visual ending" MEANS ("readers could not distinguish 'the page is over'
from 'the page failed to load'") -- this is the vocabulary of trained
perception that refinement requires.

## The Seven Files That Don't Matter

### CLAUDE.md (128 lines) -- SKIP
Navigation metadata. Points to things. Any agent reading the actual files
does not need a routing file.

### STAGE-HEADER.md (471 lines) -- SKIP
Administrative project record. Tables of scores, checklists of consumed
inputs, amendment logs. The one valuable line ("axis geometry IS density IS
organization") lives more powerfully in AD-SYNTHESIS.md.

### AD-outbound-findings.md (680 lines) -- SKIP
Registry of 28 findings in lookup format. Creates REFERENCE mode (scanning
for specific items), not creative processing. Every valuable finding appears
more powerfully in AD-SYNTHESIS.md. Individual findings could be excerpted if
the convergence synthesis identifies a gap, but the full file is waste.

### AD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md (496 lines) -- SKIP
Fix instructions for completed AD explorations. Creates VIGILANCE mode
(watching for errors) which is counterproductive in generative windows.
The one transferable insight (what auditors consistently flag) is already
captured in the convention system.

### AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (1,093 lines) -- SKIP
Pure specification: 1,093 lines of labeled rules with zero reasoning.
Already distilled into tokens.css (174 lines) and prohibitions.md (353 lines).
Loading this into any window is the archetype of the guardrail-factory
failure mode -- specification contaminating composition.

Critical distinction: AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md contains the REASONING behind
these rules. That file IS creative material. This file is the rules WITHOUT
the reasoning. The reasoning is the valuable part.

### AD-RESEARCH-GATE.md (510 lines) -- SKIP
Process verification record: "G0-01: Directories exist: PASS." Zero creative
or perceptual value.

### HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md (447 lines) -- SKIP
Stage-transition document for the provenance pipeline. The conviction content
(central discovery, strengths to protect) appears more powerfully in
AD-SYNTHESIS.md. The procedural content (acknowledgment protocol, finding
tables) is irrelevant to the building pipeline.

## Budget Pressure Strategy

If the convergence synthesis determines that 1,276 lines from AD is too much:

**First cut:** AD-SYNTHESIS.md alone (306 lines). Carries the crown jewel
insights in the most compressed form.

**Second cut:** AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md Sections I and IV only (~350 lines).
Container width story, border epidemic narrative, breathing zone philosophy,
bento grid spatial reasoning.

**Nuclear option:** Neither file. Rely on the conviction brief (from W1) and
mechanism-catalog (in W2) to carry axis knowledge indirectly. Loses
philosophical grounding but preserves operational capability.

## Distribution Summary

| File | Lines | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 |
|------|-------|----|----|----|----|
| AD-SYNTHESIS.md | 306 | YES | -- | -- | YES |
| AD-PA-CONVENTIONS.md | 970 | YES | -- | -- | YES |
| CLAUDE.md | 128 | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP |
| STAGE-HEADER.md | 471 | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP |
| AD-outbound-findings.md | 680 | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP |
| AD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md | 496 | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP |
| AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md | 1,093 | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP |
| AD-RESEARCH-GATE.md | 510 | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP |
| HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md | 447 | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP | SKIP |

**Compression:** 2 files (1,276 lines) out of 9 (5,101 lines) = 25% survives.
The 75% that's cut is pipeline infrastructure with zero compositional value.
No builder, TC agent, or refiner is made more creative by reading gate
checklists.

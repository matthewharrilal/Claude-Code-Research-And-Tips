# OD Explorations -- Creative Orchestration Across Windows

How 13 OD files create different thinking states in different windows,
and why each exploration belongs where it does.

**Total Corpus:** 13 files across case studies, HTML artifacts, and provenance
**Philosophy:** OD discovered that organization IS density -- choosing Q&A format
IS choosing PULSE rhythm. The orchestration should honor this principle: each
file goes where its organizational logic creates the thinking state that window
needs, not where its "information content" seems relevant.

---

## The Orchestration Logic

OD files divide into three creative categories:

**Proven patterns** (HTML artifacts) -- These are complete compositional
artifacts. They don't argue that Q&A produces PULSE; they ARE Q&A producing
PULSE. Scrolling through them creates a perceptual understanding that no
description can substitute. These belong in Window 2 where the builder absorbs
compositional vocabulary through direct experience.

**Derivation process** (case study .md files) -- These teach HOW a metaphor
was found: tension analysis, metaphor candidates, rejection reasoning, the
collapse moment. They create the THINKING MODE that TC needs. These belong
in Window 1 where TC learns to derive rather than select.

**Constraint architecture** (provenance files) -- Convention specs, outbound
findings, synthesis documents. These create the BOUNDARY CONDITIONS within
which creative work happens. They belong in Window 1 as the infrastructure
TC inherits and passes through to the builder.

## Window 1: TC Derivation -- Learning to Think, Not What to Think

### OD-001-conversational.md (298 lines) -- PROCESS TEACHING

This case study explanation lives in Window 1 because it teaches TC the
DERIVATION PROCESS itself. Phase 1-3 questions, tension table, metaphor
collapse moment, mechanism extraction. The anti-prescription framing
("THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE") and divergence verification protocol create
the right cognitive stance for TC: derive independently, then verify.

When TC reads this, the processing state is: "I understand how to SEARCH
for a metaphor. I see how Q&A emerged from the content's own structure,
not from a library of patterns. I can do the same search with my content."

### OD-006-creative.md (334 lines) -- COLLAPSE THINKING

This case study explanation lives in Window 1 because it teaches TC's most
sophisticated cognitive operation: recognizing when 5 separate problems
collapse into 1 insight. "Organization IS Density" was not a decision -- it
was a DISCOVERY that happened when 5 organizational modes each produced
their own density pattern without manipulation.

When TC reads this, the processing state is: "Convergence can be GENUINE.
When my tension analysis produces something that matches an existing pattern,
that might be because the pattern is real, not because I'm copying."

### OD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (468 lines) -- CONSTRAINT INFRASTRUCTURE

This convention specification lives in Window 1 as the inherited boundary
conditions: dark headers, dark code blocks, zone tokens, type scale, border
system. TC passes these constraints through to the builder as physics, not
as rules -- "your page will have a dark header" is a property of the universe,
not a regulation.

### OD-outbound-findings.md (458 lines) -- FORMAL DECLARATIONS

The 17 OD-F findings live in Window 1 as the formal vocabulary TC uses in
its output. OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density) is the crown jewel finding
that TC must honor and propagate.

### OD-SYNTHESIS.md (672 lines), OD-RESEARCH-GATE.md (152 lines), HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md (352 lines), EXT-RESEARCH-REGISTRY.md -- CONTEXT

These provenance files provide TC with the architectural context of the OD
stage: what was discovered (synthesis), what research was consumed (gate),
what was passed forward (handoff), what external research was applied (registry).
TC reads these to understand the landscape, not for creative inspiration.

## Window 2: Building -- Proven Patterns as Vocabulary

### OD-001-conversational.html (~2,100 lines) -- PROVEN Q&A PATTERN

This HTML artifact lives in Window 2 because scrolling through it creates
the PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE of Q&A producing PULSE. The width variation
(60% questions, 100% answers) creates a tidal breathing rhythm that the
builder FEELS rather than conceptualizes. Serif questions (inhale/sparse)
alternating with sans-serif answers (exhale/dense) gives each Q&A pair a
respiratory quality that no description can recreate.

The builder who studies this artifact absorbs the RELATIONSHIP between
organizational choice and density outcome. They don't learn "use 60% width
for questions" -- they learn that width variation creates attention oscillation.

### OD-004-confidence.html (~2,200 lines) -- BORDER-WEIGHT ENCODING

This HTML artifact lives in Window 2 because it demonstrates the most elegant
encoding mechanism in the entire system: border-weight gradient
(4px/3px/2px/1px) mapping to confidence level (established/probable/speculative/open).
Seeing the borders create a visual column at page scale -- legible even in a
squint test -- is a MATERIAL insight that lives in the CSS, not in prose.

The builder who studies this artifact absorbs the principle of FLAT 2D
ENCODING: you can communicate depth (geological layers, confidence strata)
entirely through 2D CSS (border weight, background color, spacing compression)
without shadows, transforms, or 3D effects.

### OD-006-creative.html (~2,350 lines) -- CROWN JEWEL PROOF

This artifact lives in Window 2 as the highest-scoring OD exploration (37/40).
It proves OD-F-005 through DIRECT DEMONSTRATION: each section cycles through
a different organizational mode, and each mode produces its own density pattern
without explicit manipulation. The builder who studies this experiences the
thesis rather than reading about it.

### OD-006-CREATIVE-RESEARCH-FEED.md (234 lines) -- RESEARCH RESOURCES

The 12 research resources curated for the crown jewel live alongside it in
Window 2, providing the builder with the same intellectual context that
produced the exploration.

### OD-004-confidence.md, OD-001-conversational.md -- SECONDARY REFERENCE

The case study explanations are available in Window 2 as secondary reference
when the builder needs to understand WHY a specific mechanism was used. The
reusable/non-reusable splits in these files guide the builder on which
techniques transfer to their own content.

---

## Window 3: Evaluation -- Secondary Consumption Only

### OD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md (523 lines), OD-SYNTHESIS.md (672 lines), HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md (352 lines)

These files provide evaluation context: the quality record (89 findings, 0
soul violations as benchmark), cross-OD patterns to verify, and gate
specifications. The evaluation window uses these to calibrate its judgment:
"100% soul compliance is the standard. 0 violations is the benchmark."

---

## Window 4: Refinement -- No Primary OD Files

OD case studies inform refinement but are not loaded actively. The refinement
builder reads perceptual audit guidelines, not OD specifications. OD's
creative intelligence reaches the refiner through the conviction brief and
the builder's output, not through raw OD files.

---

## The Creative Distinction Between File Types

The orchestration makes a surgical distinction:

**HTML artifacts teach through EXPERIENCE.** Scrolling through OD-001's Q&A
layout creates the perceptual understanding of PULSE that no amount of
description achieves. These go to the builder (W2) who needs to FEEL
the patterns.

**Case study .md files teach through PROCESS.** Reading OD-001's tension
table and collapse moment creates the methodological understanding of HOW
metaphors are found. These go to TC (W1) who needs to THINK like the
exploration's author.

**Provenance files teach through CONSTRAINT.** Reading the convention spec
creates the boundary understanding of WHAT CANNOT CHANGE. These go to TC (W1)
who needs to transmit constraints as physics.

Loading the wrong file type into the wrong window creates the wrong
processing state: an HTML artifact in W1 creates copying risk, a case study
in W2 creates meta-analysis instead of building, a convention spec in W4
creates compliance checking instead of artistic perception.

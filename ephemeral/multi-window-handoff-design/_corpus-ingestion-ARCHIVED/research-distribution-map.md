# Research Corpus -- Creative Orchestration Across Windows

How 7 research files create different thinking states in different windows,
and why each file belongs where it does.

**Total Corpus:** 7 files, 4,207 lines
**Philosophy:** Raw files go where they create the right PROCESSING STATE.
Not where they "contain relevant information" -- where they activate the
right kind of thinking.

---

## The Orchestration Logic

Research files are not interchangeable data. Each creates a distinct cognitive
state in the reader. R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS makes you FEEL density as a
six-dimensional space you can navigate. R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS makes you SEE
invisible eye-movement patterns that govern where attention goes. R5-COMBINATION-THEORY
makes you SENSE components as characters with personality traits.

The question is not "which files contain relevant information for each window?"
It is: "which files create the thinking state that each window needs to do
its work?"

## Window 1: TC Derivation -- Where Conviction Is Born

TC derives the page's compositional identity from the content itself. This
requires thinking about INFORMATION STRUCTURE (how content wants to unfold)
and ATTENTION TOPOLOGY (where eyes will move). Raw research creates this
thinking better than synthesis because TC needs to BUILD conviction from
evidence, not INHERIT it from someone else's conclusions.

### R1-DOCUMENTATION-PATTERNS.md (584 lines) -- PRIMARY

This exploration lives in Window 1 because it teaches TC how information
WANTS to unfold. The Viewport Principle (one teaching moment per scroll),
the density rhythm table, the 7 component positioning patterns -- these are
the raw materials from which TC derives page sequencing.

When TC reads R1, it enters a state of STRUCTURAL AWARENESS: "I understand
that documentation sites oscillate density for cognitive pacing. I understand
that whitespace improves retention by 38% -- not as decoration but as
functional architecture. I understand that the first sentences of paragraphs
carry disproportionate scanning weight."

This is the ONLY research file that directly addresses INFORMATION STRUCTURE
(not just visual structure). TC needs this to know WHAT to derive before
Window 2 can know HOW to build.

### R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS.md (990 lines) -- PRIMARY

This exploration lives in Window 1 because it teaches TC WHERE ATTENTION
GOES. The Z-pattern hypothesis (hero sweep, diagonal descent, terminal CTA),
the F-pattern hypothesis (top scan, side scan, detail descent), the
Gutenberg diagram -- these are the perceptual physics that govern every layout
decision.

When TC reads R4, it enters a state of SPATIAL AWARENESS: "Eyes don't scan
randomly. They follow invisible gravity fields created by reading habits,
visual weight, and spatial relationships. I can HARNESS these fields by
placing key information along their strong lines."

Without R4, TC might derive a grid that fights reading gravity. With R4, TC
understands that layout choices have PERCEPTUAL CONSEQUENCES that are
measurable (192 findings) and actionable (each pattern comes with
when-to-use guidance).

### R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md (553 lines) -- SECONDARY

R3 is secondary for Window 1 because its primary value is for the builder
(Window 2), but TC benefits from the 6-dimensional density manifold as a
derivation framework. When TC encounters content with varying information
intensity, R3 provides the vocabulary to name what's happening: "This section
has high temporal density (information changes rapidly on scroll) but low
cognitive density (the patterns are familiar)."

**Not loaded:** RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md. Too pre-digested for TC. Synthesis
comes AFTER derivation. TC that reads the synthesis inherits conclusions
instead of building conviction from evidence.

**Processing state TC should reach after reading W1 research:**
"I understand why information needs rhythm, where eyes move, and what
dimensions shape density. I can now conceive of a page structure that
HARNESSES these principles rather than fighting them."

## Window 2: Building -- Where Conviction Becomes CSS

The builder needs creative frameworks that shape HOW to execute choices.
Not rules about what to do, but metaphors and models that make aesthetic
decisions feel grounded rather than arbitrary.

### RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md (383 lines) -- PRIMARY

This lives in Window 2 because it provides the builder with a COMPASS -- 5
master principles that orient every CSS decision. "Density as Rhythm."
"Layout as Choreography." "Components as Characters." "Whitespace as
Confidence." "Typography as Architecture."

The builder who holds these principles doesn't need to be told "use 48px
spacing between sections." The builder UNDERSTANDS that spacing IS
confidence, and can feel whether their chosen values achieve it. The
conflict resolutions section (grid breaking vs. editorial precision,
progressive disclosure vs. flat design, density maximization vs. breathing
room) gives the builder permission to resolve tensions rather than follow
rules.

### R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md (553 lines) -- PRIMARY

R3 creates the sensation of navigating a six-dimensional design space. When
the builder reads about temporal density ("how fast information changes as
you scroll"), they start FEELING their page's scrolling rhythm. When they
read about cognitive density ("mental processing required per unit area"),
they start SENSING where their page demands too much.

The metaphors are the value: "density debt" (you OWE recovery space after
dense zones), "tidal framework" (information ebbs and flows), "geological
model" (atmosphere to bedrock). These are not decorative analogies -- they
are the substrate for intuitive design decisions.

### R2-CREATIVE-LAYOUTS.md (810 lines) -- PRIMARY

R2 creates PERMISSION. Without it, a builder might think "grid alignment =
good" and produce rigid layouts. With R2, the builder understands grid-
breaking as intentional choreography: "In an era of AI-generated templates,
intentional asymmetry creates visual interest through controlled chaos."

The 6 grid innovations (bento, asymmetric, fractional units, golden ratio,
Swiss, broken) give the builder OPTIONS. The "Do/Don't grids" section teaches
why certain layouts feel designed vs. generated. This is liberation from the
tyranny of perfect alignment -- and the discipline that makes liberation work.

### R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md (784 lines) -- PRIMARY

R5 creates the sensation of components as CHARACTERS with personalities.
Fast components (callouts), Slow components (code blocks, reasoning sections),
Warm components (tips, challenges), Cold components (gotchas, tasks). When
the builder reads this, components stop being interchangeable boxes and start
being actors in a narrative with velocity, temperature, and weight.

The velocity/temperature/weight model is intuitive -- builders don't need to
memorize rules, just develop feel for personality-matching. "Never stack two
SLOW components without a FAST component between them" is not a rule to
comply with but a physical sensation the builder can verify by reading their
own page.

**Processing state builder should reach after reading W2 research:**
"I understand the SOUL of this page -- its rhythms, its visual choreography,
its narrative arc. I can make aesthetic choices with confidence because I have
multiple frameworks (principles, metaphors, personality models) to ground them."

## Window 3: Evaluation -- Research Does Not Belong Here

Programmatic evaluation is rules-based (gates). Research files contain
principles, not rules. The evaluation window uses `design-system/compositional-core/`
for gates. Loading research principles into an evaluation context creates
the wrong cognitive mode -- judgment where measurement is needed.

---

## Window 4: Refinement -- Where Principles Defend Choices

The refiner needs PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDING to distinguish "this violates a
principle" from "this is intentional principle-application." The refiner is
not building -- they are SEEING, and they need the conceptual framework to
articulate what they see.

### RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md (383 lines) -- PRIMARY

The synthesis lives in Window 4 because its conflict resolutions give the
refiner a defense vocabulary. When a gate flags a grid-breaking layout, the
refiner can trace the choice to Principle 2 (Layout as Choreography): "I'm
not breaking soul constraints; I'm applying content-position grid breaking,
which is explicitly allowed."

### R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md (784 lines) -- PRIMARY

R5 gives the refiner a DIAGNOSTIC language for component sequencing.
"I grouped the 3 Tip callouts because their Light/Warm temperature creates
a cohesive advisory voice" is the kind of defense that R5's personality
model enables. Without it, the refiner can only say "this looks right."
With it, they can say WHY it looks right.

### R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md (553 lines) -- SECONDARY

R3's "density debt" concept gives the refiner a vocabulary for fatigue
diagnosis. "This section creates density debt that is never repaid" is
a precise articulation of why a page feels exhausting at a specific scroll
position.

**Processing state refiner should reach after reading W4 research:**
"I can defend every choice the builder made by tracing it to research
principles. I can also identify genuine principle violations because I
understand the principles deeply enough to distinguish intention from error."

## Evocation Ranking

Ordered by how powerfully each file transforms the reader's perception:

1. **R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS** -- geological metaphors, tidal frameworks, the sensation of navigating a 6-dimensional design space. The most transformative reading experience.
2. **R5-COMBINATION-THEORY** -- components as characters with velocity, temperature, weight. Changes how you think about sequencing.
3. **R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS** -- eye movement science, reading gravity fields. Changes how you think about WHERE things go.
4. **R2-CREATIVE-LAYOUTS** -- intentional mess, broken grids, magazine design. Changes how you think about RULES.
5. **RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS** -- master principles, conflict resolution. Changes how you think about TRADE-OFFS.
6. **R1-DOCUMENTATION-PATTERNS** -- information structure, viewport principle. Changes how you think about UNFOLDING.
7. **CLAUDE.md** -- navigation only. Zero evocation. SKIP.

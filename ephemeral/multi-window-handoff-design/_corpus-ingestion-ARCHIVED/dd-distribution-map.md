# DD Explorations -- Creative Orchestration Across Windows

How 7 DD files create different thinking states in different windows,
and why each exploration belongs where it does.

**Total Corpus:** 7 files, 2,251 lines (3 case studies + 4 provenance files)
**Philosophy:** Case studies create CALIBRATION through lived examples.
Provenance files create CONSTRAINTS through formal declarations.
Each serves a different window need.

## The Orchestration Logic

The DD explorations answered: "How do components breathe together on a page?"
Six density patterns emerged (PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL,
FRACTAL). Each is a distinct way of arranging information density across space
and time.

But the explorations are not a menu. They are PROOF that tension analysis
produces density patterns -- and that the pattern emerges FROM the content's
tensions, not from a library of available options. The orchestration challenge
is: how do you give each window the DD material that creates the right
thinking state WITHOUT creating a "pick one" mentality?

## Window 1: TC Derivation -- Constraint and Inspiration

TC needs DD material for two purposes: (1) as CONSTRAINT -- proving that
specific patterns exist so that if TC independently derives one, the
divergence check can verify independent discovery, and (2) as INSPIRATION --
showing what depth of compositional thinking is achievable.

### DD-003-islands.md (405 lines) -- CONSTRAINT FILE

DD-003 lives in Window 1 as a guardrail. When TC's tension analysis produces
something that looks like "independent content modules floating in space" --
which IS the island pattern -- DD-003 provides the divergence check. The
builder must prove they arrived at islands through their own content's tensions,
not by remembering DD-003.

The island exploration scored 32/40 (lowest DD). This is itself useful
information for TC: moderate-tension content (self-contained topics that don't
deeply oppose) produces simpler metaphors. The score tells TC that content
with moderate internal tension warrants a simpler spatial approach.

### DD-004-layers.md (429 lines) -- PROOF FILE

DD-004 lives in Window 1 as proof that multi-audience content has a powerful
resolution: geological depth. When TC encounters content serving radically
different audiences (expert/novice, overview/reference), DD-004 shows that
depth encoding can resolve this tension -- the same structure serves both
audiences through different traversal paths.

The triple encoding discovery (depth = audience level = density = structural
stability) shows TC what a "collapse moment" looks like: three separate
tensions resolving into ONE spatial idea. This is the quality of thinking TC
should aspire to.

### DD-006-fractal.md (377 lines) -- MANDATORY CONSTRAINT

DD-006 lives in EVERY window because fractal self-similarity (DD-F-006) is
the meta-pattern mandate. Whatever density pattern TC derives, it must apply
fractally -- the same rhythm visible at page level, section level, component
level, and character level.

In Window 1, DD-006 is a NON-NEGOTIABLE output requirement. TC's handoff to
W2 MUST include "Apply DD-F-006 at all scales." This is the one finding that
transcends individual explorations.

**CRITICAL:** DD-006 is the HIGHEST pattern-matching risk. The fractal concept
is so compelling that builders who encounter it before deriving their own
metaphor will attempt to apply fractal directly. In W1, it arrives as
CONSTRAINT, not as creative material.

### DD-outbound-findings.md (233 lines) -- CITATION INDEX

This lives in Window 1 as the formal registry that TC cites in its output.
When TC writes "Applying DD-F-012: Density implies axis preference," it is
citing from this file. The finding IDs create traceability from TC derivation
through to the builder's execution.

### HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md (339 lines) -- STRUCTURAL TEMPLATE

This lives in Window 1 not for its DD-to-OD content but as a TEMPLATE for
how W1's handoff to W2 should be structured: pattern pairings, mandatory
findings, quality bar, mandatory consumption items, next-stage responsibilities.

---

## Window 2: Building -- Late-Loaded Fractal Constraint

The builder does NOT receive DD case studies during building. The builder's
metaphor comes from TC (Window 1), and loading DD case studies into the
builder's context creates pattern-matching risk -- the builder sees
"geological layers" and copies the approach instead of building from TC's
derived metaphor.

### DD-006-fractal.md (377 lines) -- LATE LOAD (after metaphor locks)

DD-006 arrives in Window 2 AFTER the builder's metaphor is locked. At this
point, the builder needs to understand WHY fractal matters: "Dense/sparse
rhythm must appear at page, section, component, AND character levels
simultaneously." The risk of pattern-matching is lower because the builder
already has their metaphor; DD-006 adds a structural constraint to how that
metaphor is deployed.

**Not loaded in W2:** DD-003, DD-004 (pattern-matching risk). The builder
should use TC's derived metaphor, not the DD library.

## Window 4: Refinement -- Calibration and Validation

The refiner needs DD material to calibrate their perception of quality and
to validate that the built page achieves density patterns at the right scale.

### DD-003-islands.md (405 lines) -- QUALITY BASELINE

DD-003 at 32/40 shows the refiner what MINIMUM viable quality looks like for
moderate-tension content. This prevents the refiner from demanding CEILING-tier
quality from content that has moderate internal tension. Not every page needs
to be DD-006.

### DD-004-layers.md (429 lines) -- QUALITY BENCHMARK

DD-004 at 35/40 shows the refiner what strong metaphor execution looks like.
The triple encoding (depth + density + stability) gives the refiner a reference
for multi-coherence: at each zone boundary, MULTIPLE CSS channels should change
simultaneously.

### DD-006-fractal.md (377 lines) -- PRIMARY VALIDATION GRID

DD-006 is the refiner's primary checklist: "Does the page show the same
rhythm at all 4 scales?" The refiner examines page level, section level,
component level, and character level independently, verifying that the
dense/sparse alternation is recognizable at every zoom level.

### DD-REAUDIT-CHECKPOINT.md (221 lines) -- AUDIT TRACKING TEMPLATE

This gives the refiner a structural template for their audit: component
inventory per section, soul piece verification matrix, 8-step visual
protocol. The template shows how systematic perceptual auditing was done
on the DD explorations and provides the refiner with the same methodology.

### DD-REAUDIT-PERCEPTUAL-SYNTHESIS.md (647 lines) -- METHODOLOGY + RESULTS

This is the gold standard for how a perceptual audit should be documented.
Six full audit reports (one per DD), each following the 8-step protocol:
first impression, squint test, edge scan, shadow scan, typography scan,
structure scan, shape scan, color scan. The refiner reads this to understand
not just WHAT to look for but HOW LOOKING WORKS when done systematically.

The re-audit results are themselves a finding: DD-001 improved from 30.5 to
33 (+2.5) after soul verification. DD-003 improved from 30.5 to 32 (+1.5).
First attempts are data, not verdicts. Looking carefully at what you built
is where quality actually happens.

## Divergence Protocol -- For Window 1 Builders

When TC's metaphor converges with a DD case study, the divergence check
activates:

| Metaphor Match | Case Study | Check Required |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Islands/Archipelago | DD-003, Section 6 | 5-dimension divergence table |
| Geological/Confidence | DD-004, Section 6 | Independent discovery justification |
| Fractal self-similarity | DD-006, Section 6 | Strongest principle, highest risk |

If convergence on 3+ dimensions and justification fails, TC regenerates with
the constraint: "This metaphor is taken. What ELSE resolves your content's
tensions?"

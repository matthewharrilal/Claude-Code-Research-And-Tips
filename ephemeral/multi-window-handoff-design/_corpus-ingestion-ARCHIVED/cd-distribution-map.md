# CD Explorations -- Creative Orchestration Across Windows

How 19 CD files create different thinking states in different windows,
and why the HTML artifacts are the creative intelligence.

**Total Corpus:** 19 files, 16,328 lines across 3 locations
**Core Finding:** The compositional intelligence of the CD stage lives in
the HTML artifacts and their companion case studies. Everything else is
pipeline infrastructure. The orchestration routes ARTIFACTS to windows
and SKIPS infrastructure.

## The Orchestration Logic

CD tested what happens when density patterns (DD), organizational patterns
(OD), and axis patterns (AD) are combined on a single page. The result was
6 HTML explorations scoring 33-39/40 and 3 case studies documenting how
the most significant compositional discoveries were made.

The question is not "which CD files contain combination knowledge?" (answer:
almost all of them). The question is "which files create the PROCESSING STATE
that lets each window do its work?" An HTML artifact creates CONSTRUCTION
VOCABULARY in the builder -- seeing how velocity interleaving manifests in
CSS. A case study creates DERIVATION AWARENESS in TC -- understanding how
creative conditions produce compositional discovery. A convention spec
creates COMPLIANCE CHECKING -- the exact cognitive mode we want to avoid.

## The 6 HTML Artifacts -- The Core Creative Intelligence

### CD-001-reasoning-inside-code.html (1,654 lines)

This artifact discovered velocity interleaving -- the insight that component
READING SPEED matters more than component TYPE for sequencing decisions.
Heavy->FAST->Heavy creates breathing rhythm. Heavy->Heavy creates cognitive
drowning.

**Window 2 (Building):** The most directly builder-relevant artifact. A
builder studying this absorbs how velocity interleaving actually works in
CSS. Not as a template to copy, but as proof that the pattern resolves
heavy-component stacking. The CRESCENDO density and F-Pattern + Bento
combination become tangible: you can see the typography compress at act
boundaries, feel the page becoming more urgent.

### CD-002-task-containing-decision.html (1,567 lines)

This artifact demonstrates PULSE density -- compress/release/compress --
with task-based organization and Z-Pattern + Spiral compound axis.

**Window 2 (Building):** Reference for builders working with task-based
content. The pulse rhythm (decision pauses creating breathing room within
task sequences) creates a reading experience where the builder learns that
DECISIONS are natural PULSE generators.

### CD-003-file-tree-with-callouts.html (1,770 lines)

This artifact demonstrates ISLANDS density with Bento + Choreography. File
Tree and Callout components coexist through left-anchor DNA -- all trees
anchored left, callouts floating right.

**Window 2 (Building):** Reference for builders handling mixed component
types in spatial layouts. The left-anchor pattern is a compositional
technique worth absorbing: consistency of anchor point across heterogeneous
components creates structural unity.

### CD-004-essence-as-background.html (1,625 lines)

This artifact demonstrates the ANTI-PHYSICAL principle: essence callouts
function as ambient background through frequency and typography, NOT through
physical depth. No z-index layering. No opacity tricks. Ambient presence
through RHYTHM, not through simulated 3D space.

**Window 1 (TC Derivation):** The anti-physical principle is a WORLDVIEW
that should shape TC's metaphor derivation. When TC encounters content that
wants "background" or "ambient" presence, this artifact proves it can be
achieved through rhythm within flat-surface soul constraints.

**Window 2 (Building):** The CSS implementation proves that tidal density +
ambient presence works without shadows or z-layering. For the builder, this
is liberation: "I can create foreground/background relationships entirely
through frequency, spacing, and typography."

### CD-005-multi-axis-transition.html (2,003 lines)

This artifact is the ONLY exploration that tests transition grammar
(SMOOTH/BRIDGE/BREATHING) at multi-axis scale. Three sequential axis
patterns (Z->F->Bento) with validated transitions between them. The content
is ABOUT testing transitions -- a structural metaphor where the subject IS
the form.

**Window 1 (TC Derivation):** The transition grammar is compositional
vocabulary that TC needs for metaphor-to-layout decisions. When TC's page
has sections with different cognitive modes, this artifact proves that
transitions between modes can be intentional rather than accidental.

**Window 2 (Building):** The CSS implementation of 3-axis sequential
deployment is essential reference. The builder sees exactly how
SMOOTH transition (shared component bridging Z-to-F) differs from BRIDGE
transition (prose paragraph resetting F-to-Bento) in concrete CSS.

### CD-006-pilot-migration.html (2,085 lines) -- THE CROWN JEWEL

ALL 5 axis patterns. ALL 11 component types. 7 transitions. Fractal density
at 5 scales. 39/40 (CEILING tier). Each section USES the pattern it TEACHES.
The most compositionally dense artifact in the entire design system.

**Window 1 (TC Derivation):** Shows what maximum compositional density looks
like. TC reads this to calibrate ambition -- not "I should build exactly
this" but "this level of integration is achievable."

**Window 2 (Building):** Complete reference for how all patterns work
together in CSS. The builder studies the transitions, the component
deployment, the fractal echoing at every scale.

**Window 4 (Refinement):** The target standard. The refiner reads this to
understand what CEILING looks like, then pushes the current build toward that
compositional density. The case study (CD-006.md) explains WHICH qualities
to prioritize.

## The 3 Case Studies -- How Discoveries Were Made

### CD-001-reasoning-inside-code.md (415 lines)

This case study lives alongside its HTML artifact because it documents WHY
velocity interleaving was discovered and what creative conditions produced
it. The anti-prescription framing ("NOT A TEMPLATE") and divergence
verification table create the right cognitive stance for both TC and builder.

**Window 1 + Window 2:** TC needs the divergence thinking (what compositional
choices are AVAILABLE, not prescribed). Builder needs the mechanism deployment
logic (which techniques transfer, which are content-specific).

### CD-005-multi-axis-transition.md (386 lines)

Documents the structural metaphor discovery: "The content ITSELF is about
testing transitions. The metaphor isn't external -- it's STRUCTURAL." This
is a category of metaphor that TC should consider during derivation.

**Window 1 + Window 2:** TC needs the structural metaphor concept as a
derivation option. Builder needs the transition technique documentation
for CSS implementation.

### CD-006-pilot-migration.md (387 lines)

Documents the meta-tutorial metaphor: "The content doesn't just DESCRIBE
the design system -- it IS the design system." The anti-prescription format
for the CEILING artifact, including the reusable/non-reusable split and
divergence table.

**Window 1 + Window 2 + Window 4:** Mirrors CD-006.html distribution. Adds
the reasoning layer that the HTML alone doesn't contain.

## The 10 Files That Are Pipeline Infrastructure -- SKIP

| File | Lines | Why It's Infrastructure |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| CD-005-EVALUATION.md | 310 | Content selection decision analysis -- past process, not creative intelligence |
| CD-006-CONTENT-SELECTION.md | 422 | Content-to-pattern matching methodology -- TC can absorb this but it's low priority |
| CD-AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md | 456 | Audit scores -- metadata, not compositional intelligence |
| CD-BUILD-STATE.md | 179 | Pipeline process tracking -- zero creative value |
| R5-EVALUATION-MATRIX.md | 706 | Research coverage matrix -- the findings themselves are more useful |
| convention-audit-report.md | 309 | Convention compliance audit -- creates compliance mindset |
| lock-sheet.md | 159 | Property locking -- constraining without reasoning |
| CD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md | 1,456 | 1,456 lines of rules WITHOUT reasoning -- the guardrail-factory archetype |
| CLAUDE.md | 243 | Navigation infrastructure |
| STAGE-HEADER.md | 196 | Stage documentation |

**Total SKIP:** 4,436 lines (27% of corpus) with 0% creative value. Loading
ANY of these into a builder window reproduces the "compressing creative
knowledge into rules" failure mode.

## Context Budget -- What Actually Gets Loaded

Even within Window 2, the full artifact corpus (12,492 lines) exceeds any
window's budget. The orchestrator SELECTS based on the builder's content:

| Builder's Content Type | Primary Artifact | Secondary | Lines |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Heavy code components | CD-001 | CD-006 | ~3,740 |
| Decision/task structure | CD-002 | CD-006 | ~3,650 |
| Spatial hierarchy | CD-003 | CD-006 | ~3,855 |
| Ambient presence needs | CD-004 | CD-006 | ~3,710 |
| Multi-axis transitions | CD-005 | CD-006 | ~4,088 |
| CEILING ambition | CD-006 | CD-001 | ~3,740 |

The builder always gets CD-006 (the CEILING reference) plus ONE artifact
matching their density pattern, plus 1-2 case studies. Total: ~4,000 lines.

## Critical Insight: Case Studies Have Highest Conviction-Per-Line

415 lines of case study creates more compositional processing state than
1,654 lines of HTML. The anti-prescription format + divergence verification
tables are the most effective creative framing in the entire CD corpus. When
context budget is tight, case studies beat HTML artifacts for UNDERSTANDING.
HTML artifacts beat case studies for CONSTRUCTION VOCABULARY.

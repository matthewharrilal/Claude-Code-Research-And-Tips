## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The four extraction files are **operationally excellent and paradigmatically incomplete**. They successfully converted ~18 analysis files into ~320+ actionable enrichments with evidence, targets, and impact ratings. This is a remarkable compression achievement. But the compression systematically strips paradigm shifts, quality models, and "we're asking the wrong questions" reframings, reducing them to their downstream tactical implications.

The extractions are a **recipe book derived from a philosophy text**. The recipes are correct. The philosophy is mostly lost.

**Overall paradigm capture: PARTIAL (40-50%)**. The extractions capture the WHAT (add these questions, change these thresholds) but lose the WHY (our entire measurement epistemology is flawed in specific ways that no amount of question-adding will fix).

---

## 1. PARADIGM CAPTURE ASSESSMENT

### 1.1 "9 auditors = 1 perspective x 9" (the diversity problem)

**Source:** 17-meta-meta-analysis.md Section 2.1 -- "The diversity is in COVERAGE (different auditors cover different questions), not in PERSPECTIVE (all auditors see through the same lens)."

**Extraction status: PARTIAL**

The extractions capture WHAT to do about it:
- extract-09-18.md AR-09: "3 Opus + 3 Sonnet + 3 adversarial prompts"
- extract-meta.md Section 5.1: Lists Model D (mixed-method) and Model E (adversarial)
- extract-meta.md MM-02: "Replace 9 identical-method auditors"

But they lose the PARADIGM SHIFT: that this is not a deployment optimization problem but an **epistemological problem**. The meta-meta analysis argues that 9 auditors using the same method, same frame, same medium produces CORRELATED assessments, not independent ones. The mathematical consequence -- that adding more auditors of the same type has diminishing returns -- is the insight. The extraction reduces this to "use different models" (a tactical fix) rather than preserving "our entire auditor architecture produces convergent bias by design" (a paradigm statement).

**Verdict: The reframing is REDUCED to a deployment recommendation. The epistemological insight is LOST.**

---

### 1.2 "We measure correctness when we should measure impact" / "Object vs. Experience"

**Source:** 17-meta-meta-analysis.md Section 1.4 -- "We are measuring the page as an OBJECT when we should also be measuring it as an EXPERIENCE." Also 06-unmeasured-dimensions.md Section 3.1 -- "42 questions (~65%) are about structural properties... 6 questions (~9%) are about experience."

**Extraction status: PARTIAL**

extract-meta.md Section 6.1 preserves this well: "Quality is ALSO an encounter. We should ALSO measure it as an EXPERIENCE." It lists the five encounter dimensions (temporal unfolding, cognitive pacing, emotional trajectory, interactive discovery, return navigation).

extract-meta.md Section 6.3 preserves the rebalancing proposal.

BUT: The extractions treat this as "add experiential questions" (tactical) rather than as "the measurement medium constrains the measurement paradigm" (paradigmatic). The meta-meta analysis's deeper argument is that **screenshots produce an object-audit paradigm by necessity** -- you cannot measure temporal experience from static images. This architectural constraint is mentioned in extract-meta.md Section 3.2 (live-page interaction auditing) but is not flagged as THE central finding. It appears as item MM-12, one enrichment among 18, when it is actually the organizing principle of the entire meta-meta analysis.

**Verdict: The vocabulary is PRESERVED. The centrality of the insight is LOST. It appears as one item among many rather than as the master reframing.**

---

### 1.3 "Binary questions lose gradient information"

**Source:** 17-meta-meta-analysis.md Section 5 -- detailed analysis of what binary captures (1 bit/question) and what it cannot (degree, direction, comparison, trajectory). Evidence: PA-67 scored "PARTIAL" but forced to NO.

**Extraction status: FULL**

extract-meta.md Section 4.6 preserves the Tier 5 partial scoring proposal. extract-meta.md MM-01 preserves the Quality Journal as a dual-instrument approach. The PA-67 evidence is preserved in multiple places.

**Verdict: FULLY CAPTURED as both paradigm statement and tactical recommendation.**

---

### 1.4 "The pipeline can't measure EXPERIENCE (static screenshots)"

**Source:** 17-meta-meta-analysis.md Section 1.4 -- "The measurement medium constrains the measurement paradigm. Screenshots produce an object-audit paradigm."

**Extraction status: PARTIAL**

This appears in extract-meta.md MM-12 (live-page interaction auditing) and Section 6.1 (encounter dimensions). But the extractions do not preserve the ARGUMENT that this is an irreducible limitation -- that no amount of better questions on screenshots will capture temporal experience. The meta-meta analysis treats this as Structural Limitation #1 (highest priority). The extraction treats it as one enrichment among many.

**Verdict: MENTIONED but not PRESERVED AS A STRUCTURAL LIMITATION. Reduced from "architectural constraint of our measurement system" to "add live-page auditors."**

---

### 1.5 "Content-form isomorphism" (world-class pages make content/design inseparable)

**Source:** 16-macroscopic-quality.md Section 10 -- "The SINGLE BIGGEST THING our pipeline cannot produce, measure, or optimize for... form and content are the same thing expressed in different modalities."

**Extraction status: FULL**

extract-09-18.md MQ-05 preserves the concept with its full definition. extract-meta.md Section 6.2 includes it in the quality vocabulary table. The cross-source convergence map flags it as appearing in 3/6 sources. The "builder creative north star question" (MQ-01) directly operationalizes it.

**Verdict: FULLY CAPTURED. This is one of the best-preserved paradigm shifts.**

---

### 1.6 "The Goodhart Mechanism" -- questions as ceiling, not floor

**Source:** 17-meta-meta-analysis.md Section 4 -- "If the builder knows the PA questions, they can optimize for PASSING the questions rather than for quality... The questions suppress what they cannot measure."

**Extraction status: FULL**

extract-meta.md preserves the Goodhart analysis comprehensively: Section 4.4's four strategies (rotating pool, unprompted discovery, comparison-based, delayed assessment), AR-33 (rotating question pool), AR-34 ("is this page trying too hard?"), AR-40 (unprompted discovery auditors), MM-06 (adversarial Goodhart probe experiment).

**Verdict: FULLY CAPTURED as both paradigm and countermeasures.**

---

### 1.7 "The Tautology Problem" -- PA-05's decomposition undermines PA-05's purpose

**Source:** 17-meta-meta-analysis.md Section 4.3 -- "PA-05 is the most holistic question. But its 4 sub-criteria decompose it into a checklist. The decomposition converts an open judgment call into a 4-item verification... Reliability came at the cost of VALIDITY."

**Extraction status: LOST**

Neither extract-09-18.md nor extract-meta.md preserves this specific insight. The extractions propose PA-05 as a 4-dimensional vector (PA-30/AR-03) -- which EXTENDS the decomposition rather than questioning it. The meta-meta analysis's argument that decomposing PA-05 into sub-criteria may have destroyed what it was designed to measure is not captured anywhere.

**Verdict: LOST. The extractions propose making PA-05 MORE decomposed (vector) when the source argues decomposition itself is the problem.**

---

### 1.8 "The pipeline produces B+ reliably but cannot produce A+" -- ambition gap, not competence gap

**Source:** 16-macroscopic-quality.md Section 10 -- "The gap between B+ and A+ is not more rules, more mechanisms, more constraints. It is creative risk-taking informed by deep content understanding."

**Extraction status: PARTIAL**

The builder creative north star question (MQ-01/AR-15) captures the operational response. The comparison with world-class examples (Stripe, Apple, Linear, NYT Snow Fall) is NOT preserved in any extraction. The five qualities of world-class design (medium participates in message, unprecedented visual invention, emotional modulation, content-form isomorphism, signature visual element) appear only as a brief reference in extract-meta.md Section 6.6 but without the Gas Town mapping that shows 0/5 qualities present.

**Verdict: The OPERATIONAL response is captured. The DIAGNOSTIC framework (what world-class actually IS, mapped against our output) is LOST.**

---

### 1.9 "The design is slightly too polite for the content -- the content is punk, the design is business casual"

**Source:** 16-macroscopic-quality.md Section 6 -- the authority test revealing tonal mismatch between Yegge's wild voice and the page's disciplined presentation.

**Extraction status: LOST**

extract-09-18.md MQ-02 captures "Design must amplify content's voice" as a recommendation, but the specific, vivid diagnosis -- "the writing has swagger, the design has discipline" and "this page is a well-tailored suit for content that should be wearing a leather jacket" -- is completely absent. These are not just colorful phrases; they are PRECISE DIAGNOSTIC STATEMENTS that capture a quality dimension (voice-design alignment at macro scale) that no extraction item fully articulates.

**Verdict: LOST. The extraction captures a generic "amplify voice" instruction. The source provides a specific, memorable diagnosis of HOW voice amplification fails.**

---

### 1.10 "Our measurement system is a sophisticated prediction engine for an observable we never actually observe"

**Source:** 17-meta-meta-analysis.md Section 8 -- "The only measurement that fully captures visual quality is the unmediated human response: put the page in front of someone and watch what they do."

**Extraction status: PARTIAL**

extract-09-18.md AR-12 ("Test pipeline against NOTHING -- human benchmark") and MM-17/MM-18 (calibrate against human judgment, user behavior observation) capture the experimental proposals. But the PHILOSOPHICAL REFRAMING -- that all our instruments (binary PA, Quality Journal, gates, everything) are predictions of a ground truth we never measure -- is not preserved as a paradigm statement. It appears only as experiment proposals.

**Verdict: The EXPERIMENTS are captured. The EPISTEMOLOGICAL HUMILITY is LOST.**

## PARADIGM CAPTURE SUMMARY TABLE

| # | Paradigm Shift | Status | Notes |
|---|---------------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | 9 auditors = 1 perspective x 9 | PARTIAL | Reduced to deployment recommendation |
| 1.2 | Object vs Experience (central finding) | PARTIAL | Vocabulary preserved, centrality lost |
| 1.3 | Binary loses gradient information | FULL | Well-preserved with operational proposals |
| 1.4 | Screenshots constrain paradigm | PARTIAL | Mentioned but not flagged as structural limitation |
| 1.5 | Content-form isomorphism | FULL | Best-preserved paradigm shift |
| 1.6 | Goodhart mechanism (questions as ceiling) | FULL | Comprehensive preservation |
| 1.7 | PA-05 tautology (decomposition destroys holism) | LOST | Extractions propose MORE decomposition |
| 1.8 | B+ ceiling (ambition gap not competence gap) | PARTIAL | Operational response yes, diagnostic framework no |
| 1.9 | Content is punk, design is business casual | LOST | Generic "amplify voice" replaces specific diagnosis |
| 1.10 | Prediction engine for unobserved observable | PARTIAL | Experiments preserved, epistemology lost |

**Score: 3 FULL, 5 PARTIAL, 2 LOST out of 10 paradigm shifts.**

---

## 2. QUALITY MODEL CAPTURE

### 2.1 Film Editing Pacing Models

**Source:** 06-unmeasured-dimensions.md Section 4.1 -- Kuleshov Effect, invisible cuts, rhythm vs tempo vs dynamics distinction.

**Extraction status: LOST**

No extraction preserves the film editing vocabulary or concepts. The Kuleshov Effect (context changes element meaning) is not captured. The distinction between rhythm, tempo, and dynamics -- three independent musical dimensions our framework collapses into one -- appears only in the new PA questions (PA-82 tempo, PA-83 dynamics) without the theoretical grounding explaining WHY these are separate dimensions.

**Verdict: CONCEPTS OPERATIONALIZED as questions but THEORETICAL GROUNDING LOST.**

---

### 2.2 Musical Composition: Composed vs. Arranged

**Source:** 06-unmeasured-dimensions.md Section 4.2 -- thematic development, motivic unity, harmonic progression, dynamic contour.

**Extraction status: PARTIAL**

extract-01-08.md E06-12 captures "thematic return" (one specific concept from the musical model). extract-meta.md Section 6.2 includes "thematic return" in the quality vocabulary. But the broader framing -- that the Gas Town page is a "good arrangement" approaching but not achieving "composition" -- and the specific musical criteria (motivic unity, harmonic progression) are lost.

**Verdict: ONE CONCEPT (thematic return) preserved. The COMPOSITIONAL FRAMEWORK lost.**

---

### 2.3 Architectural Quality (Christopher Alexander)

**Source:** 06-unmeasured-dimensions.md Section 4.3 -- Alexander's "quality without a name," the removal test, the distinction between "built" and "designed."

**Extraction status: LOST**

No extraction references Alexander. The distinction between "designed building" (creates an experience of place) and "built building" (satisfies functional requirements) maps directly to the 3/4 vs 4/4 gap but is not preserved. The "nothing could be added or removed without damaging the whole" principle is not captured.

**Verdict: COMPLETELY LOST.**

---

### 2.4 Typography Craft Vocabulary (alive vs mechanical)

**Source:** 06-unmeasured-dimensions.md Section 4.4 -- tension at the edge, optical vs mathematical precision, the "double take."

**Extraction status: LOST**

No extraction preserves the alive-vs-mechanical type distinction. The concept that the Gas Town page's typography is "professional and forgettable" (mechanical) rather than having "unexpected pairings that work" (alive) is diagnostic information that would inform builder instructions but is not captured.

**Verdict: COMPLETELY LOST.**

---

### 2.5 Game Design: Crafted vs. Procedural

**Source:** 06-unmeasured-dimensions.md Section 4.5 -- signature moments, pacing awareness, breadcrumbs.

**Extraction status: LOST**

The crafted-vs-procedural distinction maps perfectly to the pipeline's challenge (the pipeline IS procedural generation; it needs to produce crafted-feeling output). This mapping is not preserved.

**Verdict: COMPLETELY LOST.**

---

### 2.6 Editorial Design: Bloomberg vs. Corporate Whitepaper

**Source:** 06-unmeasured-dimensions.md Section 4.6 -- editorial-weight-by-importance, deliberate disruption, white space as editorial tool.

**Extraction status: PARTIAL**

extract-01-08.md E08-09 captures "editorial-weight-by-importance heading treatment" as a specific enrichment. But the broader Bloomberg comparison and the principle that editorial design adjusts weight by CONTENT importance (not heading level) is reduced to a single CSS instruction.

**Verdict: ONE PRINCIPLE operationalized. The COMPARATIVE FRAMEWORK lost.**

---

### 2.7 Perceptual Science Foundations

**Source:** 14-perceptual-science-foundations.md -- 4-stage human visual processing pipeline, Gestalt principles with coverage gaps, Birkhoff's Aesthetic Measure, processing fluency, cognitive load theory.

**Extraction status: PARTIAL**

extract-09-18.md preserves all 20 specific enrichments (PS-01 through PS-20) and the 10 New Measurement instruments (NM-01 through NM-10). extract-meta.md Section 3.1 lists all instruments with scoring tiers.

BUT: The 4-stage visual processing pipeline (pre-attentive -> attentive binding -> cognitive evaluation -> aesthetic-emotional) that ORGANIZES the entire analysis is not preserved. The 30-dimension gap map with coverage percentages is not preserved. The Weber-Fechner Law explanation for WHY warm palettes need 1.3-1.5x threshold deltas is not preserved.

The extractions capture the INSTRUMENTS but lose the THEORY that generated them. This matters because the theory explains WHY these instruments measure what they measure and guides future instrument development.

**Verdict: INSTRUMENTS preserved (10/10). THEORY lost (the organizing framework that explains why these instruments exist and how they relate to human perception).**

---

### QUALITY MODEL CAPTURE SUMMARY

| Quality Model | Source | Status |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Film editing (rhythm/tempo/dynamics, Kuleshov) | 06 Section 4.1 | LOST (questions preserve concepts, not theory) |
| Musical composition (composed vs arranged) | 06 Section 4.2 | PARTIAL (thematic return only) |
| Architecture (Alexander, quality without a name) | 06 Section 4.3 | LOST |
| Typography craft (alive vs mechanical) | 06 Section 4.4 | LOST |
| Game design (crafted vs procedural) | 06 Section 4.5 | LOST |
| Editorial design (Bloomberg vs whitepaper) | 06 Section 4.6 | PARTIAL (one principle) |
| Perceptual science (4-stage pipeline, Gestalt, Birkhoff) | 14 full document | PARTIAL (instruments yes, theory no) |

**Score: 0 FULL, 3 PARTIAL, 4 LOST out of 7 quality models.**

---

## 3. QUESTION-ABOUT-QUESTIONS ASSESSMENT

**Source:** 17-meta-meta-analysis.md -- the entire document asks whether our measurement APPROACH is fundamentally flawed.

**Extraction status: PARTIAL -- reduced to "add more questions"**

The meta-meta analysis identifies 5 structural limitations:

| Limitation | Captured? | How |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| 1. Object-audit, not experience-measurement | PARTIAL | Listed as a paradigm but not as #1 priority |
| 2. Convergent auditor bias | PARTIAL | Deployment changes proposed, epistemology lost |
| 3. Degree blindness | FULL | Quality Journal proposal well-preserved |
| 4. Goodhart vulnerability | FULL | Comprehensive countermeasures preserved |
| 5. Cognitive architecture mismatch | PARTIAL | Reordering proposed but framing as "mismatch" lost |

The meta-meta analysis's deepest finding -- Section 8, "The Meta-Meta Finding" -- argues that this entire analysis (17 reports analyzing 65 questions analyzing a single page) is ITSELF a measurement system with its own biases, and that "visual quality may be partially ineffable." This philosophical core is COMPLETELY ABSENT from the extractions.

**Verdict: The meta-meta analysis was reduced to "here are better questions and better auditor deployments." The fundamental questioning of WHETHER questions can capture visual quality was LOST.**

---

## 4. EXPERIMENT DESIGN PRESERVATION

| Experiment | Source | Preserved? | Quality |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| E1: Architecture Effect Test | 17 Section 6.1 | YES | FULL -- hypothesis, method, cost, expected insight all preserved |
| E2: Dual-Instrument Comparison | 17 Section 6.2 | YES | FULL -- key test (do QJ scores distinguish pages binary rates identically?) preserved |
| E3: Adversarial Goodhart Probe | 17 Section 6.3 | YES | FULL -- method and strategic value preserved |
| Pipeline vs Nothing (human benchmark) | 13 AR-12/AR-36 | YES | PARTIAL -- proposal preserved, specific hypothesis less detailed |
| Cross-model evaluation | 13 | YES | PARTIAL |
| Threshold awareness A/B test | 13 AR-05 | YES | PARTIAL |
| Human validation (5 designers) | 13 AR-12 | YES | PARTIAL |
| Experiential question placement A/B | 06 implicit | YES | PARTIAL |
| World-description framing test | 13 AR-35 | YES | FULL |
| Single-agent Opus baseline | 13 AR-36 | YES | FULL |
| 3-pass build experiment | 13 AR-37 | YES | FULL |
| Brief line budget A/B | 13 AR-38 | YES | FULL |

**Verdict: GOOD. Experiments are the best-preserved category. 6 FULL, 6 PARTIAL, 0 LOST.**

---

## 5. WHAT'S STILL MISSING

### 5.1 Against the user's original requirements

The user asked for:

**"Better perceptual checks"**
- WELL SERVED: 46 new PA questions proposed, 10 new measurement instruments, 7 new gates.
- MISSING: The perceptual SCIENCE explaining why these checks work (Gestalt theory, processing fluency, Weber-Fechner) is stripped. A synthesizer reading only the extractions would know WHAT to add but not WHY it works.

**"What actually 'better visual quality' is comprised of"**
- PARTIALLY SERVED: The 14-dimension radar (Section 6.2 quality vocabulary), the 5 macroscopic tests (share/memory/return/emotion/authority), the Quality Journal.
- MISSING: The 30-dimension gap map from perceptual science (14-perceptual-science-foundations.md Part 6) with coverage percentages. The world-class comparison framework (16-macroscopic-quality.md Section 9). The specific diagnosis of Gas Town's quality position ("well-tailored suit for content that should be wearing a leather jacket").

**"Metacognitive standpoint so we don't get tunnel visioned"**
- POORLY SERVED: The meta-meta analysis's central arguments about measurement paradigm limitations are reduced to tactical items. The philosophical questioning of whether questions CAN capture visual quality is absent. The self-aware observation that "this analysis is itself a measurement system with its own biases" is absent.
- WHAT'S NEEDED: The synthesis must include a "Paradigm Limitations" section that preserves the meta-meta analysis's structural critiques AS STRUCTURAL CRITIQUES, not as enrichment items.

**"Telescopically, microscopically, and macroscopically"**
- TELESCOPIC (system-level): PARTIALLY SERVED -- pipeline ceiling analysis, object-vs-experience reframing.
- MICROSCOPIC (CSS-level): WELL SERVED -- 15 CSS enrichments, gate fixes, threshold adjustments.
- MACROSCOPIC (quality-at-scale): POORLY SERVED -- the macroscopic quality tests (share/memory/return/emotion/authority) are present but the rich comparative analysis against world-class pages is absent.

**"Fresh eyes, adversarial reviews, meta-cognitive analysis"**
- Fresh eyes: WELL SERVED -- Reader Auditor proposed, audience-aware auditing, unprompted discovery auditors.
- Adversarial: WELL SERVED -- 42 adversarial enrichments preserved, Goodhart countermeasures, adversarial auditors.
- Meta-cognitive: POORLY SERVED -- the meta-meta's self-questioning about measurement epistemology is reduced to deployment optimizations.

---

### 5.2 Specific META-LEVEL insights that need to be added to the synthesis

1. **THE FIVE STRUCTURAL LIMITATIONS OF THE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM** (from 17-meta-meta.md Section 7) -- not as enrichments but as CONSTRAINTS that bound all other enrichments. The synthesis should open with these.

2. **THE 30-DIMENSION GAP MAP** (from 14-perceptual-science.md Part 6) with coverage percentages -- this is the most rigorous assessment of what our instrument covers and misses. It should be a reference table in the synthesis.

3. **THE WORLD-CLASS COMPARISON FRAMEWORK** (from 16-macroscopic.md Sections 9a-9c) -- 5 qualities of world-class design mapped against Gas Town (0/5). This frames the entire improvement effort.

4. **THE PA-05 TAUTOLOGY ARGUMENT** (from 17-meta-meta.md Section 4.3) -- decomposing PA-05 into sub-criteria may have destroyed its holistic quality. The extractions propose making it MORE decomposed (vector). The synthesis should flag this tension.

5. **THE QUALITY MODELS FROM OTHER FIELDS** (from 06-unmeasured.md Sections 4.1-4.6) -- not the tactical derivatives but the conceptual frameworks (composed vs arranged, crafted vs procedural, alive vs mechanical). These provide VOCABULARY for talking about the 3/4-to-4/4 gap that pipeline-native vocabulary lacks.

6. **"THE PIPELINE PRODUCES B+ RELIABLY; IT CANNOT PRODUCE A+ AT ALL"** (from 16-macroscopic.md Section 10) -- this is not an enrichment; it is a STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT that frames which enrichments matter. The synthesis should preserve this as a framing statement.

7. **THE META-META FINDING** (from 17-meta-meta.md Section 8) -- "visual quality may be partially ineffable" and "our measurement system is a prediction engine for an observable we never observe." This is the ultimate metacognitive insight and it is completely absent from all extractions.

---

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SYNTHESIS

### What the synthesis MUST include that extractions missed:

1. **A "Paradigm Shifts" section** (500-800 words) that preserves the 10 paradigm shifts from Section 1 above as PARADIGM STATEMENTS, not enrichment items. Each shift gets 3-5 sentences: what we currently assume, why that assumption is wrong, and what the reframing implies.

2. **A "Quality Models" section** (300-500 words) that summarizes the 7 quality models from other fields with their core diagnostic vocabulary. This gives the synthesis a conceptual toolkit that pipeline-native vocabulary lacks.

3. **A "Structural Limitations" section** (200-300 words) that lists the 5 limitations from the meta-meta analysis as CONSTRAINTS on all proposed enrichments. No amount of new questions fixes "screenshots constrain the measurement paradigm."

4. **A "Strategic Assessment" framing** (100-200 words) that preserves the B+ ceiling finding and the 0/5 world-class qualities mapping. This sets expectations for what enrichments can and cannot achieve.

5. **A "What We Still Can't Measure" section** (200-300 words) that honestly acknowledges the irreducible gaps: content-form isomorphism can be encouraged but not specified; surprise can be enabled but not guaranteed; visual quality may be partially ineffable.

6. **Preserve the 30-dimension gap map** as a reference table. This is the most rigorous tool for prioritizing future measurement investments.

### What the synthesis should NOT do:

- Should NOT add more enrichment items. 320+ is already too many.
- Should NOT re-describe the operational enrichments (those are well-served).
- Should NOT treat paradigm shifts as just another category of enrichment.

---

## 7. FINAL ASSESSMENT

| Category | Capture Quality | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Paradigm shifts | **PARTIAL** (3/10 FULL, 5/10 PARTIAL, 2/10 LOST) | Operational derivatives preserved, epistemological insights lost |
| Quality models from other fields | **POOR** (0/7 FULL, 3/7 PARTIAL, 4/7 LOST) | Worst-preserved category. Entire conceptual vocabulary missing. |
| Question-about-questions | **PARTIAL** | Reduced from "is our approach fundamentally flawed?" to "add better questions" |
| Experiment designs | **GOOD** (6/12 FULL, 6/12 PARTIAL) | Best-preserved category |
| User's "metacognitive standpoint" requirement | **POORLY SERVED** | The meta-cognitive insights are the primary casualty of the extraction process |
| User's "telescopic/microscopic/macroscopic" requirement | **MIXED** | Microscopic excellent, macroscopic poor, telescopic partial |

**The extractions are a triumph of operational extraction and a failure of paradigm preservation.** They will produce excellent tactical improvements to the pipeline. They will not produce the fundamental reorientation that the source analyses argue is needed.

The synthesis must bridge this gap by including the paradigm-level insights AS paradigm-level insights, not by converting them into more enrichment items.

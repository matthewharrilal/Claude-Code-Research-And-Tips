# Visual Audit: Steve Yegge Gas Town Page (Fresh Pipeline Run)

**Auditor:** visual-auditor (independent, screenshot-based)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Screenshots reviewed:** 28 images across 3 viewports (1440px, 1024px, 768px)
**Method:** Cold-look first impressions, then systematic scroll-through at each viewport

---

## Part 1: Per-Screenshot Analysis (1440px Viewport)

### 1440-cold-look / scroll-01 (First Impression)

**What I see:** Dark header band at top with red accent breadcrumb text ("DEEP EXTRACTION / LEVEL 7 / AGENT FACTORY ARCHITECTURE"), large serif title "Steve Yegge and Gas Town" in white, followed by a subtitle and a row of 4 metadata stats (Complexity Level 7, Roles 8 Specialized, Memory Beads 225K LOC, Daily Cost $50-200). Below the header: a cream/warm background with a two-column table of contents (13 chapters, numbered 01-13) with uppercase "CONTENTS" label. Below that: zone 1 begins with "ZONE 1 -- THE SHIFT" label, a thin red rule, the italic serif heading "You Are Here," and an ASCII code block showing a complexity ladder (Level 0-7) with Level 7 highlighted in red.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. The header has confident dark-on-cream contrast, the breadcrumb hierarchy uses red accent color, metadata row is well-spaced, and the TOC uses a clean two-column numbered layout. The zone label system ("ZONE 1 -- THE SHIFT") with red rule gives structural rhythm.

**What works well:**
- Dark header creates strong visual anchor and authority
- Red accent color used sparingly and consistently (breadcrumb, zone labels, highlights)
- Metadata row is clean and information-dense without clutter
- Two-column TOC is functional and well-proportioned
- Zone label system provides immediate wayfinding

**What doesn't work:**
- Title line-breaks awkwardly ("Gas" on line 1, "Town" on line 2) -- could be one line at this width
- Subtitle text is low-contrast gray on dark, barely readable
- The gap between TOC and Zone 1 is large (~100px visually) -- feels slightly empty

**Visual variety:** Good start. Dark header to cream body is a strong first transition. TOC to content is a clear shift.

---

### 1440-scroll-02 (You Are Here + Opening Prose)

**What I see:** Bottom of the ASCII ladder code block (Level 0: Single Interactive Session), then a large drop-cap "Y" starting the opening paragraph. Body text in dark gray on cream. A "GATE" callout box with red left border, warm pink/salmon background, prerequisites text. Then "Who is Steve Yegge?" heading in italic serif, paragraph text, and a 3-column table (Company / Role / Relevance) for Amazon, Google, Sourcegraph, Current.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. The drop-cap, the Gate callout box with red border on salmon background, and the well-proportioned table all read as intentional.

**What works well:**
- Drop-cap "Y" is elegant -- a genuine editorial touch
- Gate callout box is visually distinct: salmon background, red border, bold "Prerequisites" label
- Table is clean with proper column headers in small-caps
- Good information density without feeling cramped

**What doesn't work:**
- Table rows lack any zebra-striping or subtle row differentiation

**Visual variety:** HIGH. Code block -> prose with drop-cap -> callout box -> table. Four distinct visual elements in one viewport.

---

### 1440-scroll-03 (Gas Town Mental Model)

**What I see:** "The Gas Town Mental Model" heading in italic serif. A blockquote with warm salmon background, italic serif text quoting Steve Yegge ("Claude Code is the world's biggest fuckin' ant..."), with "STEVE YEGGE" attribution in small-caps. Body paragraphs explaining the colony model. An "ESSENCE" callout (red label on salmon background) with another Yegge quote. Discussion of Mad Max: Fury Road reference. Then a red full-width rule and transition to "ZONE 2 -- THE FACTORY FLOOR" with "The 8 Roles Architecture" heading.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. The blockquote styling is the standout -- warm background, italic serif, proper attribution. The zone transition with red rule is clean.

**What works well:**
- Blockquote treatment is genuinely attractive -- warm tone, proper serif italic, attribution
- Zone transition (red divider + zone label) creates clear room change
- "ESSENCE" callout provides emphasis without being heavy-handed
- Prose is well-set: ~65-75 characters per line, good measure

**What doesn't work:**
- The zone 2 background shifts to a slightly warmer/darker cream -- the delta is very subtle, almost imperceptible
- Two blockquotes in close proximity creates some visual repetition

**Visual variety:** Good. Quote -> prose -> callout -> zone transition. The page is establishing its rhythmic vocabulary.

---

### 1440-scroll-04 (Roles Architecture -- ASCII Diagram + Role Cards)

**What I see:** Large dark code block with ASCII art showing the "GAS TOWN ROLE HIERARCHY" -- Town Level (Mayor, Deacon, Dogs), Rig Level (Refinery, Witness, Polecat), Crew, and Human Level (Overseer). Below: "Town-Level Roles" heading and a 2x2 grid of role cards. Each card has a colored label ("TOWN LEVEL" in red or "RIG LEVEL" in teal/green), italic serif role name (Mayor, Deacon, Dogs, Refinery), description text, and a monospace model/command line at bottom.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. This is one of the strongest scroll positions on the entire page. The ASCII hierarchy diagram is substantial and well-formatted. The role cards use a clear grid layout with colored labels differentiating town-level (red) from rig-level (teal).

**What works well:**
- ASCII hierarchy diagram is a genuine visual centerpiece -- informative and well-structured
- 2x2 card grid with color-coded labels is excellent for scannability
- Cards have consistent structure: label, name, one-liner, description, command
- The shift from full-width diagram to card grid creates visual variety

**What doesn't work:**
- Cards use a very subtle gray border -- could be slightly more defined
- All card backgrounds are the same warm cream -- no differentiation between town/rig levels

**Visual variety:** HIGH. Full-width ASCII art -> heading -> 2x2 card grid. The strongest visual variety moment on the page.

---

### 1440-scroll-05 (More Role Cards + Communication Flow)

**What I see:** Remaining role cards (Witness, Polecat, Crew at half-width, Overseer at full-width with different treatment -- green "HUMAN LEVEL" label). Then "Communication Flow" heading and a large dark code block with another ASCII diagram showing the flow: Overseer -> Mayor -> Refinery -> Polecats/Witness -> Dogs -> Complete.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. The Overseer card stands out with full width and green label. The communication flow ASCII art is the second major diagram.

**What works well:**
- Overseer card at full width signals its unique importance
- Human-level label uses distinct green/teal color
- Communication flow diagram is well-structured with clear directional arrows
- Crew card only taking half-width visually communicates its lesser importance

**What doesn't work:**
- Two large dark code blocks (hierarchy + communication) are similar in treatment
- The cards-to-diagram transition has a large gap

**Visual variety:** Moderate. More cards then another ASCII diagram. Some repetition of the dark-block-on-cream pattern starting.

---

### 1440-scroll-06 (Beads Memory System -- Zone 3)

**What I see:** Zone 3 transition ("ZONE 3 -- THE NERVOUS SYSTEM"). "Beads: The Memory System" heading. '"The 50 First Dates" Problem' subheading with a red-bordered blockquote. Problem/Consequence table. Then "What Beads Does" paragraph.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. Zone transition is clean. The "50 First Dates" metaphor gets proper blockquote treatment.

**What works well:**
- Zone label system continues to provide reliable wayfinding
- Red-border blockquote for the evocative metaphor is effective
- Problem/consequence table is clean and scannable

**What doesn't work:**
- Background color shift for zone 3 is imperceptible
- Starting to enter a "text + table" rhythm

**Visual variety:** Moderate. Functional but less visually exciting than the role cards section.

---

### 1440-scroll-07 (Beads Memory Model + 6 Waves)

**What I see:** Dark code block with "BEADS MEMORY MODEL" ASCII art showing 3 layers (Hot/Warm/Cold Context) with color-coded layer labels (red, amber, blue). "Key Beads Commands" code block with syntax highlighting. "The 6 Waves of AI" table (Wave/Era/Description/Productivity) with wave 6 highlighted.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. The memory model uses color effectively; the 6 Waves table is informative and well-structured.

**What works well:**
- Beads memory model with color-coded layers (red, amber/gold, blue) is visually rich
- Key commands code block has syntax highlighting (green for commands)
- 6 Waves table is a standout information piece -- clean, scannable, current wave highlighted

**What doesn't work:**
- Three dark code blocks close together (memory model, commands, and previous communication flow) starts to feel heavy

**Visual variety:** Moderate to High. Diagram -> code -> table. The table provides a nice break.

---

### 1440-scroll-08 (8 Stages Dev Evolution + Core Principles Begin)

**What I see:** "8 Stages of Dev Evolution" table (Stage 7 highlighted). A "CRITICAL WARNING" callout with red label on salmon background -- bold quote about chimpanzees. Then "ZONE 4 -- THE CONTROL ROOM" transition. "Core Principles" heading. GUPP principle in left-bordered blockquote with red label and italic serif quote. "ZERO FRAMEWORK COGNITION" principle beginning.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. The critical warning callout is the strongest visual "interrupt" on the page.

**What works well:**
- Stage 7 row highlighting in table is effective "you are here" device
- Critical warning callout is visually commanding -- best use of salmon background + red accent
- Core principles use consistent visual grammar: uppercase label, italic serif quote, explanatory text

**What doesn't work:**
- Principles section starts with identical left-border + label treatment that will repeat many times

**Visual variety:** Good at this position. Table -> callout (excellent) -> zone transition -> principle cards.

---

### 1440-scroll-09 (Core Principles -- THE MONOTONY ZONE)

**What I see:** Four more principle blocks in identical format: "AGENTS AS CATTLE, NOT PETS," "NONDETERMINISTIC IDEMPOTENCE," "TOKEN SPEND AS HEALTH METRIC," "TALK TO THE PLAN, NOT THE AGENT." Each with uppercase label, italic serif maxim, and explanation paragraph. Then zone 5 transition.

**Designed or default?** This section tips toward DEFAULT feeling. While each individual principle block is well-constructed, the repetition of 5-6 identical blocks creates a wall of sameness.

**What works well:**
- Each principle's maxim is well-written and properly typeset
- Bullet list in "Agents as Cattle" provides slight variation

**What doesn't work:**
- **Five consecutive principle blocks with identical visual treatment = monotony.** This is the first dead zone.
- No diagrams, tables, or visual breaks between principles
- All left borders appear to be the same color -- missed opportunity for semantic coding

**Visual variety:** LOW. This is the weakest stretch on the page. Pure repetition of the principle-card pattern.

---

### 1440-scroll-10/11 (Implementation Guide -- Code-Heavy Zone)

**What I see:** Prerequisites table, Installation code blocks (go install, gt version, gt init), green-bordered "CHECKPOINT" callouts, more code blocks (adding rigs, starting core roles, tmux workflow). A tmux session ASCII diagram. The full gastown-start.sh startup script.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED but code-heavy. The CHECKPOINT callouts with green border are a welcome new element.

**What works well:**
- CHECKPOINT callouts with green border provide progress markers -- a new visual element
- Code blocks have syntax highlighting (green commands, colored strings)
- tmux session ASCII diagram is compact and informative
- The code-checkpoint rhythm provides natural pacing

**What doesn't work:**
- Very code-heavy: 3-5 dark code blocks per viewport
- The relentless dark-code-on-cream pattern dominates for 3-4 scroll positions
- Startup script is very long -- could benefit from collapsible treatment

**Visual variety:** LOW to MODERATE. The CHECKPOINT callouts help, but the section is necessarily code-heavy.

---

### 1440-scroll-12 (Daily Workflow + Checkpoints Table)

**What I see:** Large dark code block with daily workflow commands (syntax-highlighted). "Checkpoints and Verification" heading with "Post-Installation Checkpoints" 3-column table (Step / Command / Expected Output).

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED but fatiguing by this point.

**What works well:**
- Daily workflow code block has excellent structure and commenting
- Checkpoints table is clean and practical

**What doesn't work:**
- Code blocks have dominated for 5+ consecutive scroll positions
- Viewer has been looking at dark-on-cream for a long time

**Visual variety:** LOW. Still in the code-heavy implementation zone.

---

### 1440-scroll-13 (Troubleshooting -- VARIETY RECOVERY)

**What I see:** Health check code block, "Troubleshooting" heading with expandable accordion items (Context Collapse, Race Conditions, Runaway Crew, Mayor Deadlock, Beads Desync, Agent Won't Start -- each with disclosure triangles and left borders). "Recovery Command Reference" in a 2x2 grid of command pairs (Soft Reset/Hard Reset, Kill All/Force Beads, Clear Inbox/Emergency Stop, Restart Worker/Resume Work) with red labels.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. This is a visual variety recovery point.

**What works well:**
- Troubleshooting accordions (disclosure triangles) provide interactive depth-on-demand
- Recovery command grid is excellent: 2x2 layout with red labels creates scannable reference
- The shift from code blocks to interactive elements is welcome

**What doesn't work:**
- All accordion items are collapsed -- no visual preview of content

**Visual variety:** HIGH. This section breaks the code monotony with accordions + command grid.

---

### 1440-scroll-15 (Quotes + Comparison Tables)

**What I see:** Quote callouts with colored left borders -- red/coral "ON MATURITY," green "ON LANGUAGE CHOICE." Then "Comparison with Other Patterns" heading with comparison tables (Ralph Wiggum, CC Mirror, Infinite Orchestra).

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. Multi-colored quote borders show good use of the color vocabulary.

**What works well:**
- Multi-colored quote callouts (red, green, purple, blue) provide the best color diversity on the entire page
- Comparison tables are well-structured

**What doesn't work:**
- Three comparison tables in a row feel repetitive -- identical styling for all three

**Visual variety:** Moderate to High. The colored quote callouts are the best color-diversity moment on the page.

---

### 1440-scroll-16 (Cost Estimation + Sources)

**What I see:** Cost estimation dark code block with color-coded dollar amounts. Sources section in 4-quadrant layout (Blog Posts, GitHub Repos, Podcasts, Community Extensions). Blue-bordered "BOOK" callout.

**Designed or default?** DESIGNED. Sources layout is clean and well-organized.

**What works well:**
- Cost estimation uses color for dollar amounts -- immediately scannable
- Sources 4-quadrant layout is organized and comprehensive
- Blue "BOOK" callout adds another border color

**What doesn't work:**
- Sources section is purely text lists -- functional but not exciting

**Visual variety:** Moderate. Cost block -> source grid -> book callout.

---

### 1440-scroll-17 (Footer + Void Begins)

**What I see:** Dark footer bar with red top border. Footer contains italic serif quote ("Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant."), metadata line. Below the footer: PURE BLANK CREAM SPACE filling the entire remaining viewport.

**Designed or default?** Footer is DESIGNED; the trailing void is a SEVERE DEFECT.

**What works well:**
- Footer quote provides bookend closure (colony metaphor matching the opening)
- Red top-border ties to the red accent used throughout

**What doesn't work:**
- **THE TRAILING VOID.** Below the footer is pure blank cream space extending for multiple viewports.

---

### 1440-scroll-18 through scroll-22 (The Void)

**What I see:** Scroll positions 18-22 at 1440px are ALL pure blank cream/off-white space. No content, no elements. Approximately 4-5 full viewport heights of nothing.

**Designed or default?** DEFECTIVE. This is a bug, not a design choice.

**Severity:** CRITICAL. A viewer who reaches the footer would scroll through empty desert wondering if content failed to load.

---

## Part 2: 1024px Viewport Analysis

### 1024-cold-look/scroll-01

The layout holds well at 1024px. Header retains full structure, TOC maintains 2-column layout, zone system still reads clearly. Content column narrows proportionally. No horizontal overflow.

**Assessment:** DESIGNED. Graceful degradation.

### 1024-scroll-05 (Role Cards)

Role cards maintain 2-column grid. Cards are narrower but readable. Color-coded labels (red TOWN LEVEL, teal RIG LEVEL) still clear. Cards compress well without truncation.

**Assessment:** DESIGNED. Card grid degrades gracefully.

### 1024-scroll-08 (Beads + 6 Waves)

Beads memory model ASCII diagram, Key Beads Commands, and 6 Waves table all fit within narrower viewport. 4-column table is slightly tighter but legible.

**Assessment:** Functional. Tables handle the narrower width without breaking.

### 1024-scroll-12 (Implementation)

CHECKPOINT callouts, code blocks for rigs, starting core roles. Implementation content translates well.

**Overall 1024px assessment:** The page degrades gracefully. No layout breaks, no horizontal overflow, no content loss. Card grids maintain 2-column. The page reads well at this breakpoint.

---

## Part 3: 768px Viewport Analysis

### 768-cold-look/scroll-01

Header compressed to narrow width. Metadata row tight but fits. TOC maintains 2-column (barely). ASCII ladder code block fits without horizontal scroll. Drop-cap "Y" still visible.

**Assessment:** DESIGNED but approaching limits. TOC 2-column is cramped.

### 768-scroll-05 (Roles + Communication Flow)

Overseer card visible, Communication Flow ASCII diagram. Role cards appear to maintain 2-column but are very tight at 768px.

**Issue:** Cards should probably collapse to single-column at this breakpoint.

### 768-scroll-08 (Core Principles)

Principle blocks are naturally full-width, so no layout change needed. Zone 5 transition still clear. But monotony is even more pronounced because each block takes more vertical space (wider text wraps more).

### 768-scroll-12 (Troubleshooting + Recovery + When to Use)

Recovery command grid still fits at 768px. "Nature prefers colonies" dark band works well at any width (full-viewport). Use/Don't Use comparison still readable.

**Highlight:** The dark quote band is viewport-width and looks excellent regardless of size.

### 768-scroll-15/18 (Footer + Void)

Footer renders correctly. The trailing void is WORSE at 768px -- the viewport is portrait-oriented, making each viewport of blank space feel even more vast. Approximately 5-7 scroll actions of pure blank.

**Overall 768px assessment:** The page degrades functionally. Nothing breaks or overflows. But it doesn't adapt -- it's a narrower version of the 1440 design rather than being optimized for this viewport. Card grids probably should collapse to single-column. The void is proportionally worse.

---

## Part 4: Synthesis

### Full Scroll Arc

| Zone | Name | Scroll Feel | Visual Energy |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| Header + TOC | -- | Strong opening | HIGH |
| Zone 1: The Shift | "You Are Here" | Orientation, grounding | HIGH |
| Zone 2: Factory Floor | 8 Roles Architecture | Peak visual interest | HIGHEST |
| Zone 3: Nervous System | Beads Memory | Good but settling | MODERATE |
| Zone 4: Control Room | Core Principles | Monotony onset | LOW |
| Zone 5: Assembly Line | Implementation | Code-heavy, functional | LOW-MODERATE |
| Zone 6: The Dispatch | When to Use, Quotes, Comparisons | Recovery | MODERATE-HIGH |
| Footer | -- | Clean close | MODERATE |
| Post-footer | Void | Catastrophic | ZERO |

**The scroll arc has a sag in the middle (Zones 4-5).** The opening (header through role cards) is the visual peak. The core principles section creates monotony through repetition of identical block formats. The implementation section is necessarily code-heavy. The page recovers visual energy in Zone 6 with the quote band, comparisons, and colored callouts. Then the void destroys the ending.

### Zone Transitions

Zone transitions are implemented consistently via:
- "ZONE N -- THE [NAME]" label in small-caps
- Thin red/colored horizontal rule
- Italic serif section heading

**Assessment:** The zone labels provide reliable wayfinding and the "room change" naming convention (The Shift, Factory Floor, Nervous System, Control Room, Assembly Line, The Dispatch) supports the industrial refinery metaphor. However, the background color changes between zones are so subtle as to be imperceptible. If the pipeline intended distinct background colors per zone, they are not achieving the desired visual separation. Zone transitions are felt through the labels and rules, not through any spatial/color shift.

**Rating: 3/5.** Zone labels work; background shifts do not register perceptually.

### Metaphor Visibility

The refinery/industrial metaphor is:
- **VISIBLE in content/labels:** Zone names (Factory Floor, Nervous System, Control Room, Assembly Line, Dispatch), role names (Refinery, Polecat, Crew, Overseer), Mad Max reference, "Idea Compiler" description.
- **PARTIALLY visible in CSS:** Dark header with red accent evokes industrial command panel. Dark code blocks against cream suggest control-room terminals. Role cards with color-coded labels suggest factory floor organization.
- **NOT structurally pervading:** The CSS does not embody the refinery metaphor at a deep level. No visual elements uniquely communicate "refinery" or "factory." The design could equally represent any technical documentation.

**Rating: 2/5 for CSS metaphor integration.** Metaphor is ANNOUNCED (via labels) but not STRUCTURAL (via spatial design).

### "Wow" Moments

1. **Scroll-04 (Role Cards Grid):** The 2x2 card grid with ASCII hierarchy diagram is the visual peak. Genuinely designed and informative.
2. **Dark interstitial band ("Nature prefers colonies."):** The single most visually powerful moment at any viewport. Creates pause, shift in register, reflection.
3. **Cold-look (First Impression):** Dark header with red accent breadcrumb is a confident opening that says "this is a serious document."
4. **Critical Warning callout (scroll-08):** The aggressive Yegge quote against warm pink background commands attention. Best emotional beat.
5. **Recovery Command Reference grid (scroll-13):** Best data-dense component. 2x4 grid with colored labels and monospace commands.
6. **Use/Don't Use comparison (scroll-14):** Excellent information design with green/red parallel structure.
7. **Colored quote borders (scroll-15):** The diversity of border colors (red, green, purple, blue) provides the best color variety on the page.

### Dead Zones

1. **Core Principles (scroll-09):** Five consecutive principle blocks with identical visual treatment. No diagrams, tables, or visual breaks. The flattest content stretch.
2. **Implementation Code Blocks (scroll-10 through 12):** 3-4 viewports of predominantly dark code blocks. Appropriate for content but visually monotonous.
3. **THE TRAILING VOID (scroll-18 through 22):** 4-5 viewports of pure blank cream. Catastrophic.

### Viewport Degradation

| Aspect | 1440px | 1024px | 768px |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Layout integrity | Excellent | Excellent | Good |
| Card grids | 2x2 | 2x2 | 2-col (too tight) |
| Tables | Spacious | Adequate | Cramped |
| Code blocks | Comfortable | Good | Tight but no overflow |
| ASCII diagrams | Readable | Readable | Readable |
| Trailing void | Bad (4-5 viewports) | Bad | Worse (taller ratio) |

**Overall degradation assessment:** The page degrades gracefully across all viewports. No layout breaks, no content loss, no horizontal overflow. The card grid should collapse to single-column at 768px. **Viewport handling is a strength of this page.**

### The Trailing Void

**Severity: CRITICAL / SHIP-BLOCKING**

The trailing void after the footer spans approximately 4-5 viewport heights of completely blank cream space at 1440px, worsening to 5-7 viewports at 768px. The footer element exists and renders correctly (confirmed via debug screenshots), but the page continues for thousands of pixels below it with zero content.

**Why it matters:**
1. It is the absolute last thing a viewer sees. The visual impression of scrolling through emptiness is the final memory.
2. It suggests a rendering error or incomplete page.
3. It invalidates any sense of "designed" -- no designer would leave this.
4. The footer's "bookend" effect gets stranded far above the actual page bottom.

**Root cause hypothesis:** `min-height: 100vh` or similar CSS on body/wrapper extending beyond content. Or large bottom margin/padding on a container element.

**Fix priority:** BLOCKING. Must be fixed before the page can be considered shippable.

### Overall Assessment

**Would a first-time viewer be impressed, satisfied, or disappointed?**

**Satisfied with caveats, trending toward impressed for the first half.**

**The good news is substantial:**
- Clear, confident voice
- Consistent, well-executed visual vocabulary (dark code blocks, colored blockquotes, card grids, zone labels, checkpoint callouts)
- Excellent content structure -- 6 named zones with clear progression
- Professional-grade viewport handling
- 7 genuinely impressive moments (role cards, quote band, colored quotes, command grid, use/don't-use, warning callout, drop-cap)
- ASCII diagrams are a strength, not a weakness

**The problems are concentrated, not distributed:**
- The trailing void is the #1 defect by a large margin
- Core principles monotony (Zone 4) is a moderate issue
- Implementation code-heaviness (Zone 5) is inherent to content, not really a design failure
- Imperceptible background color shifts are a missed opportunity
- Metaphor is labeled rather than structural

**PA-05 Estimate:** 3/4 if the trailing void is fixed. 2/4 with the void present. The void is the single largest drag on "designed" impression.

---

## Summary Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| First impression | 4/5 | Strong dark header, confident opening |
| Visual variety | 3/5 | Good peaks (cards, quotes) but monotone valleys (principles, code) |
| Zone transitions | 3/5 | Labels work; background shifts imperceptible |
| Metaphor in CSS | 2/5 | Announced, not structural |
| Component vocabulary | 4/5 | Blockquotes, cards, tables, callouts, code, accordions -- rich |
| Typography | 4/5 | Italic serif headings, body text, small-caps labels -- well-executed |
| Color system | 3/5 | Red accent + zone colors work, but restricted palette overall |
| Viewport handling | 4/5 | Graceful degradation across all 3 widths |
| Trailing void | 0/5 | Catastrophic defect, ~25-30% of page is blank |
| Overall "designed" feel | 3/5 | Would be 4/5 without the void |

---

## Three Highest-Leverage Fixes

1. **Eliminate the trailing void** (CRITICAL) -- likely a CSS min-height or body height issue. The footer should be the terminal visual element.
2. **Add visual differentiation to zone transitions** -- background color shifts with >= 15 RGB delta, spacing density changes, or typographic scale shifts between zones.
3. **Break the Core Principles monotony** -- vary the layout: put 2 principles side-by-side, use a different component format for one, add a diagram or visual break mid-section.

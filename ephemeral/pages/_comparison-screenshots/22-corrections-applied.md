# CD-006 Framing Corrections Applied

**Applier:** correction-applier (Opus)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Source audit:** `20-cd006-framing-audit.md` (framing-auditor)
**Scope:** 7 reports corrected (2 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM)

---

## Summary

Applied framing correction addenda to 7 reports. All corrections ADD a clearly marked "FRAMING CORRECTION (2026-02-22)" section at the END of each file. No original text was modified or deleted.

The core correction in every case: CD-006 is CEILING tier (~72% of Flagship 4/4), not the quality benchmark. The Flagship 4/4 standard (14 dimensions, pervading structural metaphor, PA-05 >= 3.5 AND Tier 5 >= 6/8) is the actual target. Flagship 4/4 has NEVER been achieved.

---

## Priority 1: CRITICAL

### 1. Report 09 — Richness Philosophy (`09-richness-philosophy.md`)

**What was corrected:**
- Section 5 "Crown Jewel Comparison" scored pages as percentages of CD-006 (60%, 75%), normalizing CD-006 as 100%
- Section 8 appendix claimed "CD-006's recursive self-reference is the ceiling" and "maximum possible binding"
- The report's implicit message: aspire to CD-006

**Correction added:**
- Reframed Section 5: correct question is "how do pages compare to CEILING tier?" not "how close to CD-006?"
- Reframed Section 8 conclusion: CD-006's self-reference is the ceiling of INCIDENTAL binding, not DESIGNED binding
- Noted that a Flagship page with a deliberately constructed structural metaphor could achieve DIFFERENT and deeper quality
- Affirmed the report's central arguments (richness as vocabulary fluency, TC brief as crystallization, multiplicative anti-scale model) remain sound and independent of CD-006 benchmarking

**How conclusions change:** The report's philosophical findings about richness emergence are UNAFFECTED. What changes: the aspiration target shifts from "75% of CD-006" to "Ceiling tier on the way to Flagship 4/4." The false ceiling is removed.

---

### 2. Report 11 — Metacognitive Quality Philosophy (`11-metacognitive-quality.md`)

**What was corrected:**
- Section 4 "The Crown Jewel Gap" opened with "CD-006 is the benchmark"
- Pages scored as fractions of 39/40 (26-28/40, 31-34/40)
- Declared "The ceiling for Gas Town content is probably 36-37/40"
- Proposition 9 referenced "the gap to CD-006 (39/40)" as aspirational distance

**Correction added:**
- Reframed "CD-006 is the benchmark" to "CD-006 is the best existing CEILING-tier artifact"
- Noted that scoring against 39/40 conflates CEILING with maximum quality
- Challenged the 36-37/40 content ceiling claim: if Flagship requires qualities CD-006 LACKS, the ceiling is not defined by CD-006's score
- Reframed Proposition 9 to reference the tier model
- Affirmed the report's philosophical analysis (Pirsig, visitor test, content honor, restraint, metacognitive loop, 9 propositions) as excellent and independent

**How conclusions change:** The 9 propositions about quality remain FULLY VALID. What changes: the Section 4 benchmark shifts from CD-006 to the tier model. The claim that Gas Town maxes out at 36-37/40 becomes questionable -- Flagship-level compositional intelligence applied to Gas Town could potentially exceed that.

---

## Priority 2: HIGH

### 3. Report 17 — Soul Resonance (`17-soul-resonance.md`)

**What was corrected:**
- "Crown jewel resonance" as a scoring dimension (7/10 and 9/10)
- "CD-006 contemporary" and "CD-006 younger sibling" as quality labels
- CD-006 Comparison subsection measuring pages against CD-006 as the soul standard

**Correction added:**
- Renamed scoring dimension recommendation: "Design system soul resonance" instead of "Crown jewel resonance"
- Contextualized "CD-006 contemporary" as CEILING-tier quality, not the pinnacle
- Noted CD-006's own Flagship gaps (no unified metaphor, local multi-coherence)
- Affirmed the 6-layer analysis methodology as the report's core contribution, independent of CD-006 benchmarking

**How conclusions change:** Page B still wins soul resonance (the 6-layer analysis is unaffected). The MEANING of winning changes: "inhabits the design system at CEILING tier" rather than "matches the crown jewel." The aspiration beyond CEILING (Flagship-level soul inhabitation) becomes visible.

---

### 4. Report 19 — Personality Test (`19-personality-test.md`)

**What was corrected:**
- Test 2 "Family Photo" framed as kinship with CD-006 specifically
- "Crown jewel" language used without tier classification
- Quality measured as resemblance to a specific artifact rather than adherence to principles

**Correction added:**
- Reframed family photo test: kinship with DESIGN SYSTEM PRINCIPLES, not with CD-006
- Relabeled CD-006 as "CEILING-tier reference artifact" instead of "crown jewel"
- Affirmed all 7 test methodologies (Voice, Family Photo, Accumulated Intelligence, Content Honor, Restraint, Perception, Accumulation) as valid core contributions
- Noted the 7-0 verdict for Page B is NOT affected by the correction

**How conclusions change:** The verdict (Page B wins 7-0) is UNCHANGED. What changes: "family resemblance" is measured against principles, not against an artifact. This opens space for future pages to EXCEED CD-006 on family resemblance by achieving Flagship-level principle inhabitation.

---

## Priority 3: MEDIUM

### 5. Report 13 — Design Intelligence Traceability (`13-design-traceability.md`)

**What was corrected:**
- "Crown jewel divergence" label for CD-006 (line 16/87)
- 39/40 score used parenthetically as quality validation (line 134)

**Correction added:**
- Relabeled CD-006 as CEILING-tier exploration
- Noted that provenance references to CD-006 as a data source ARE appropriate
- Affirmed MINIMAL impact: the report's provenance depth methodology, 10+10 traced decisions, and causation-vs-correlation analysis are fully independent

**How conclusions change:** NONE. The corrections are cosmetic label changes. The report's central finding (provenance prevents failure, doesn't cause richness) is unaffected.

---

### 6. Report 18 — Granular Soul Audit (`18-granular-soul-audit.md`)

**What was corrected:**
- "Crown jewel benchmark, 39/40" label in Design System DNA Sources (line 15)

**Correction added:**
- Relabeled to "CEILING-tier reference artifact (39/40)"
- Noted that using CD-006 as a practical CSS convention reference is APPROPRIATE
- Affirmed LOW impact: all 10 category verdicts and overall soul alignment conclusions remain valid

**How conclusions change:** NONE. The label change in the header has no effect on the per-element CSS comparison methodology.

---

### 7. Report 08 — Master Synthesis (`08-MASTER-SYNTHESIS.md`)

**What was corrected:**
- "Uncomfortable Truth 5: The Recipe Caps Quality at CEILING" uses CEILING ambiguously (tier name vs general concept)
- The synthesis does not explicitly note that CEILING tier is below Flagship 4/4 in all contexts

**Correction added:**
- Clarified that "reliable Ceiling" is a tier classification with Flagship above it
- Noted CD-006 achieves ~72% of Flagship standard
- Affirmed LOW impact: the synthesis already contains the correct Flagship definition in Part 6

**How conclusions change:** MINIMAL. The synthesis already frames Ceiling-vs-Flagship accurately in most places. The correction adds redundant clarity to ensure "reliable Ceiling" is understood as a tier, not as the ceiling of possibility.

---

## Cross-Cutting Observations

1. **Reports 01-07 required ZERO corrections.** Quantitative, dimension-specific reports naturally avoid benchmark framing because they measure what they measure without needing a quality standard to reason against.

2. **Reports 09 and 11 (philosophical/metacognitive) had CRITICAL framing issues.** Philosophical analysis requires a standard, and analysts reached for CD-006 because it's concrete and memorable. Future philosophical analysis should reference Report 14 (Flagship Definition) as the framing foundation.

3. **Reports 17, 18, 19 (soul/personality tests) used "crown jewel" language inherited from the project's historical vocabulary.** The phrase "crown jewel" should be retired in favor of "CEILING-tier reference artifact."

4. **No report's CORE FINDINGS were invalidated by the correction.** All corrections affected supplementary benchmark comparisons, not the central analytical contributions. This is reassuring: the analytical work is sound, only the framing context needed updating.

5. **The corrections create a consistent analytical frame across all 19 reports.** The tier model (Floor / Middle / Ceiling / Flagship) is now the universal quality reference, with CD-006 correctly placed at the top of CEILING and Flagship 4/4 as the unachieved aspiration.

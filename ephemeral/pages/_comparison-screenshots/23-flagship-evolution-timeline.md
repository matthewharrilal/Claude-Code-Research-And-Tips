# 23 — Flagship 4/4 Evolution Timeline: What Was Added Beyond CD-006

**Task:** Research the full Flagship 4/4 evolution — what was added beyond CD-006, why each addition was made, and how it raises the bar beyond CEILING.

**Core framing:** CD-006 is a CEILING artifact (39/40, 41 mechanisms, 5 scales). Flagship 4/4 is a THEORETICAL register that has never been achieved. The evolution documented here traces how the Flagship standard was *constructed* — each step adding requirements that CD-006 does not satisfy, raising the bar from "excellent vocabulary fluency" to "integrated atmospheric composition."

---

## Phase 0: The CD-006 Baseline (Pre-Evolution)

**What CD-006 IS:**
- 41 mechanism instances across 7 categories (7 spatial, 8 typographic, 6 chromatic, 7 structural, 4 behavioral, 4 material, 5 relational)
- Score: 39/40 on original assessment rubric
- Soul compliance: 59/60
- Fractal density at all 5 scales (page → section → component → element → character)
- 5 unique grid topologies
- 6-step type scale with 4 weight gradients
- Average 3.36 channels shifting per zone boundary
- Geological metaphor ("strata" concept)
- Sequential axis deployment
- Meta-tutorial format coupling content to form

**What CD-006 is NOT (the gaps that define Flagship):**
- Geological metaphor applies to ~1 of 8 sections only → NOT unified structural metaphor
- Multi-coherence operates WITHIN zones, not ACROSS zones → NOT global multi-coherence
- Mechanisms are independently excellent, not in concert → NOT atmospheric integration
- No evidence of 3+ mechanisms encoding the same semantic concept simultaneously
- Average channels/boundary = 3.36 (below Flagship threshold of avg >=4)

---

## Phase 1: Middle-Tier Experiment (2026-02-16) — Discovery of Two PA-05 Registers

**What happened:** The Middle-Tier experiment produced a page scoring PA-05 DESIGNED (4/4) with 12 mechanisms, F-PATTERN layout, 3/3 novelty. Built in ~35 minutes by a flat file-bus team.

**What was ADDED beyond CD-006 understanding:**
1. **Two-register PA-05 discovery.** The Middle experiment proved that PA-05 4/4 can mean two different things:
   - **Middle 4/4:** "Every scroll position shows intentional composition" — mechanisms present and varied, vocabulary fluent. Professional, competent, B+ effort.
   - **Flagship 4/4:** "Every scroll position shows integrated atmosphere" — mechanisms in concert, encoding the same semantic concept. A through Z.

2. **WHY:** The Middle experiment showed that 12 independently-deployed mechanisms could achieve PA-05 4/4 through vocabulary fluency alone. This meant CD-006's 41 mechanisms and PA-05 score did not automatically equal Flagship — it only proved vocabulary mastery at scale. The question became: what's ABOVE vocabulary fluency?

3. **How this raises the bar:** Flagship now requires not just "many good mechanisms" but mechanisms that WORK TOGETHER to produce atmospheric unity. Count alone is insufficient.

---

## Phase 2: Flagship Experiment Failure (2026-02-17) — Negative Evidence Crystallizes the Standard

**What happened:** 19 agents, 5 passes, 6 programmatic gates. Output: `07-intentionality.html` (2,034 lines, 86KB). Gates PASSED but perceptual audit FAILED catastrophically: zero borders, uniform typography (all 16px/400), backgrounds differing by 1-8 RGB points (imperceptible), 6 whitespace voids (210-276px each). Richness score: 34/91 vs CD-006's 80/91.

**What was ADDED beyond CD-006 understanding:**
1. **Perception thresholds as hard gates.** CD-006 never needed explicit perception thresholds because its mechanisms were naturally perceptible. The Flagship failure revealed that without minimum perceptible deltas, technically-present mechanisms are visually absent:
   - Backgrounds: >= 15 RGB delta between zones (CD-006 had 18-20+; Flagship had 1-8)
   - Font-size: >= 2px between zones
   - Letter-spacing: >= 0.025em floor
   - Stacked gaps: <= 120px total (Flagship had 210-276px)

2. **S-09 stacking loophole.** Individual spacing values passed S-09 (<=96px) but STACKED values at section boundaries created 210-276px voids. Flagship standard now requires TOTAL gap measurement, not per-property.

3. **Programmatic gates ≠ perceptual verification.** Gate 4 confirmed 6 CSS channels with 4+ shifts per boundary. Gate 5 fresh-eyes found them imperceptible. This is THE central finding: compliance and quality diverge when thresholds are sub-perceptual.

4. **WHY:** The 963-line master prompt had a 7.9:1 guardrail-to-playbook ratio. Builders got told what NOT to do but never what TO DO. Sub-perceptual variation satisfies every rule — the truest root cause.

5. **How this raises the bar:** Flagship now requires PERCEPTIBILITY as a gating criterion, not just presence. This is something CD-006 achieved naturally but was never codified. The bar moves from "mechanisms exist in CSS" to "mechanisms are visually detectable by a human viewer."

---

## Phase 3: Flagship Dissection (2026-02-17) — Root Cause Taxonomy

**What happened:** 16 agents produced 16 reports analyzing the failure. Remediation prompt delivered (301 lines, 6 phases).

**What was ADDED beyond CD-006 understanding:**
1. **Guardrail factory diagnosis.** The pipeline produces GUARDRAILS (constraints, prohibitions, thresholds) at a 7.9:1 ratio over PLAYBOOKS (recipes, CSS values, sequenced steps). CD-006 was never built from guardrails — it was built from creative intent. Flagship standard now recognizes that recipe format (sequenced steps with concrete CSS) produces DESIGNED output while checklist format (thresholds and constraints) produces FLAT output.

2. **Builder visibility cap.** Only 75 lines (~13.4%) of the 963-line master prompt reach the CSS-writing agent. Zero compositional intelligence reaches the builder. CD-006's builder had full creative authority; the Flagship pipeline's builder had only constraints.

3. **Inverted quality routing.** Best reference files (mechanism catalog, scale-channel invocation) go to the PLANNER who doesn't write CSS. The BUILDER gets tokens + prohibitions + a MISSING file reference. CD-006's quality was emergent from a single builder with full context.

4. **CSS budget misallocation.** Flagship spent 22% of CSS (227 lines) on imperceptible micro-typography (letter-spacing 0.001-0.01em). CD-006 spent equivalent budget on 11 components, 5 grids, 3 breakpoints. The prompt's emphasis on "refinement gradients" directed skill toward invisibility.

5. **WHY:** These root causes revealed that the failure was not about WHAT to build but about HOW information reaches the builder. CD-006 succeeded because one Opus builder had full context and creative authority. The pipeline fragmented that context across agents.

6. **How this raises the bar:** Flagship now requires not just quality output but quality ROUTING — the right information reaching the right agent. The standard expands from "what the artifact looks like" to "what conditions produce it."

---

## Phase 4: Flagship Retrospective (2026-02-17) — 15 Root Causes, Recipe vs Checklist

**What happened:** 9 Opus agents, 9 reports. 6/8 original root causes confirmed, 7 NEW root causes discovered. 10 master takeaways.

**What was ADDED beyond CD-006 understanding:**
1. **Recipe vs Checklist as the master variable.** The Middle experiment's builder got a 100-line RECIPE (sequenced steps, specific CSS values, "Read/Select/Deploy/Assess" verbs). The Flagship builder got a 71-line CHECKLIST (all constraints, "Verify/Fail if/Must be" verbs). Recipe → DESIGNED; Checklist → FLAT. CD-006 had no checklist at all — it was pure creative execution.

2. **Builder cognitive modes.** Four modes identified:
   - COMPOSING (produces 4/4) — builder makes aesthetic choices
   - PLANNING-THEN-EXECUTING (produces 4/4) — builder plans holistically then executes
   - COMPLYING (produces 1.5/4) — builder satisfies constraints minimum-viable
   - REPAIRING (produces 2.5/4) — builder fixes existing work incrementally

   CD-006's builder was in COMPOSING mode. Flagship's builder was in COMPLYING mode.

3. **660:1 meta-to-output ratio.** The Flagship experiment generated 660 lines of meta-analysis per line of useful output. Threshold: if meta-output exceeds 20:1, the pipeline is feeding on itself.

4. **Contrarian unification:** RC-1 (no CSS-generative arrow), RC-2 (guardrail ratio), RC-3 (builder cap), RC-8 (sub-perceptual emphasis) are ONE cause — the pipeline compresses compositional intelligence out of the builder's reach.

5. **Sonnet-for-builders is unexamined.** CD-006 was built by Opus. Flagship builders were Sonnet. Sonnet complies meticulously; Opus complies AND creates beyond constraints. Potentially the highest-leverage single intervention.

6. **WHY:** The retrospective showed that CD-006 succeeded not because of superior design system knowledge but because of superior builder conditions: full context, creative authority, composing mode, Opus model. Flagship standard must account for these conditions.

7. **How this raises the bar:** Flagship now includes meta-process requirements — the RECIPE FORMAT requirement, the BUILDER MODE requirement, the META-RATIO threshold. The standard is no longer purely about the artifact; it's about the conditions of production.

---

## Phase 5: Remediation (2026-02-17/18) — PA-05 from 1.5 to 2.5

**What happened:** Enhanced spec (1,025 lines, 9 phases), Opus builder applied CSS + targeted HTML restructuring. Mode 4 PA (9 auditors, 48 questions): PA-05 improved from 1.5/4 to 2.5/4. Verdict: SHIP WITH FIXES.

**What was ADDED beyond CD-006 understanding:**
1. **REPAIRING mode ceiling = 2.5/4.** Even with an Opus builder and comprehensive remediation spec, working on existing flawed HTML caps at 2.5/4. This confirms that COMPOSING mode (building from scratch with creative authority) is necessary for higher scores.

2. **Phase 0 deallocation.** 216 lines of sub-perceptual CSS had to be REMOVED before improvement could begin. The existing CSS was actively harmful — not just insufficient but misleading.

3. **Accessibility as a Flagship dimension.** Remediation added full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (0/8 → 8/8). CD-006 was never tested for accessibility. Flagship now includes accessibility as a baseline requirement.

4. **WHY:** The remediation proved that you cannot REPAIR your way to Flagship. The ceiling for incremental improvement is COMPOSED (3.0-3.5/4), still below Flagship threshold.

5. **How this raises the bar:** Flagship requires COMPOSING mode — building from creative intent, not fixing from constraint compliance. The 2.5/4 ceiling for repair mode sets a hard boundary below Flagship.

---

## Phase 6: Pipeline Analysis (2026-02-18) — Compression and Routing Diagnosis

**What happened:** 50+ agents, 41 files (~1.7MB). Analyzed why the master prompt failed (PA-05 1.5/4) and remediation partially succeeded (PA-05 2.5/4).

**What was ADDED beyond CD-006 understanding:**
1. **134,800:1 total compression ratio.** From research → CSS, the pipeline compresses 134,800 lines of insight into 1 line of output. At that ratio, compositional intelligence is mathematically destroyed.

2. **Optimal instruction volume: 70-150 lines.** Above 200 lines, interference overtakes benefit. The 963-line master prompt was 5-10x beyond optimal. CD-006 had no prompt at all — just creative intent.

3. **Recipe ceiling thesis.** Three format tiers:
   - SPECIFICATION format (constraints/thresholds) → ceiling 2.5/4
   - PROCEDURAL format (sequenced recipes with CSS) → ceiling 3.0-3.5/4
   - DISPOSITIONAL format (internalized understanding) → possibly 4/4, but this is what CD-006 had naturally

4. **Binary rules achieve compliance, not quality.** ">=3 distinct spacing values" is satisfied by 48px/49px/50px — technically compliant, semantically empty. CD-006 never needed such rules because its builder had compositional judgment.

5. **WHY:** The pipeline analysis revealed that the fundamental architecture — compress research into rules, route rules to agents, verify compliance — has a ceiling below Flagship. CD-006 bypassed this architecture entirely.

6. **How this raises the bar:** Flagship now includes an ANTI-SPECIFICATION requirement — the builder must have enough creative authority that it operates in COMPOSING/DISPOSITIONAL mode, not COMPLYING mode. The standard acknowledges that more rules = worse output past a threshold.

---

## Phase 7: Flagship 4/4 Recipe Research (2026-02-18) — 14 Binary Dimensions Defined

**What happened:** 24 Opus agents, 23 reports. The Flagship 4/4 standard was formally defined as 14 binary dimensions. CD-006 was reclassified from Flagship to CEILING.

**What was ADDED beyond CD-006 understanding:**

### The 14 Dimensions (with CD-006 status)

| # | Dimension | Threshold | CD-006 Status |
|---|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| D-01 | Mechanism count | >= 14 | PASS (41) |
| D-02 | Zone transitions | >= 8 with >= 3 channels each | PASS (8+) |
| D-03 | Channels per boundary | min 3, avg >= 4 | FAIL (avg 3.36) |
| D-04 | Multi-coherence instances | >= 3 of >= 3 channels encoding same concept | FAIL (~1-2) |
| D-05 | Fractal scales | All 5 represented | PASS |
| D-06 | Semantic density | >= 1 mechanism per 80px scroll | PASS |
| D-07 | Perceptibility floor | All mechanisms visually detectable | PASS |
| D-08 | Restraint ratio | >= 20% of available techniques deliberately unused | PASS |
| D-09 | Component types | >= 8 of 11 system components | PASS (11/11) |
| D-10 | Designed moments | >= 3 scroll positions with 4+ simultaneous mechanisms | BORDERLINE |
| D-11 | Axis variety | >= 3 distinct axes across page | PASS |
| D-12 | Layout diversity | >= 3 distinct grid/flex topologies | PASS (5) |
| D-13 | Unified structural metaphor | Single metaphor pervading ALL sections | FAIL (geological in ~1/8) |
| D-14 | Creative surprise | >= 2 mechanisms not in catalog/expected | BORDERLINE |

**CD-006 passes ~8-10 of 14 dimensions.** The CRITICAL failures that separate CEILING from Flagship:

1. **D-03: Average channels per boundary (3.36 < 4.0).** CD-006's zone transitions are rich but not MAXIMALLY rich. Flagship requires every boundary to be a full multi-channel event, averaging 4+ channels shifting simultaneously.

2. **D-04: Global multi-coherence (>=3 instances).** This is THE defining Flagship dimension. Multi-coherence = 3+ CSS channels encoding the SAME semantic concept simultaneously (e.g., "increasing tension" expressed through tightening spacing, warming colors, AND accelerating rhythm at once). CD-006 has multi-coherence within individual zones but not as a repeated global pattern.

3. **D-13: Unified structural metaphor across ALL sections.** CD-006's geological metaphor appears in ~1 of 8 sections. Flagship requires a single metaphor that pervades EVERY section — not as decoration but as structural principle. The meta-tutorial format IS CD-006's structural metaphor, but it's a content metaphor, not a visual/spatial metaphor.

### Additional Flagship Requirements Added

4. **Tier 5 PA questions (PA-60 through PA-67).** 8 new questions that detect quality ABOVE PA-05 4/4:
   - PA-60: Can you identify a single metaphor that unifies the page?
   - PA-61: Do mechanisms reinforce each other or operate independently?
   - PA-62: Does the page have "atmosphere" — a pervasive quality beyond individual elements?
   - PA-63: Could you remove any one mechanism without the page feeling incomplete?
   - (PA-64 through PA-67: additional atmospheric/integration measures)

   Success bar: PA-05 >= 3.5 AND Tier 5 >= 6/8

5. **Anti-scale model.** Richness = semantic density × restraint × spatial confidence. Multiplicative — zero in ANY factor = zero richness. CD-006 naturally has all three; Flagship codifies them as gates.

6. **14 quality suppressors.** 5 ABSOLUTE + 9 CONTEXTUAL factors that prevent Flagship quality:
   - ABSOLUTE: checklist format, prohibition overload, inverted quality routing, sub-perceptual emphasis, analytical pipeline
   - Quality equation: Quality = (Skill × Coupling × Metaphor) / Active Suppressors
   - Flagship requires neutralizing ALL 5 absolute suppressors

7. **Success bar formula:**
   - PA-05 >= 3.5 (floor detection)
   - Tier 5 >= 6/8 (ceiling detection)
   - Zero soul violations
   - Metaphor = STRUCTURAL (pervading, not announced)
   - All 14 dimensions PASS

### Key Cross-Cutting Findings from the Recipe Research

- **F-01: Recipe Paradox.** More specification produces worse output. 134,800:1 compression ratio destroys compositional intelligence. Optimal: 70-150 lines of recipe-format instruction.
- **F-02: Content is uncontrolled confound.** Different content types afford different mechanism deployment. Results are not purely pipeline-attributable.
- **F-05: N=0 is dominant risk.** Flagship 4/4 has NEVER been produced. The standard is theoretical, defined by what CD-006 lacks rather than what any artifact demonstrates.
- **F-06: Layout diversity is the hidden lever.** CD-006's multi-coherence is emergent from rotating grid patterns (5 unique topologies). Single-column layouts cannot achieve multi-coherence.

---

## Phase 8: Build-Page Prompt Assembly (2026-02-18/19) — 542-Line Master Execution Prompt

**What happened:** 34 agents, 42 deliverables. Master execution prompt: 542 lines, 10 sections, 9 verification checkpoints.

**What was ADDED beyond CD-006 understanding:**
1. **Quality Floor codified.** Minimum requirements: >= 14 mechanisms, 800+ CSS lines, >= 3 channel shifts per boundary. These are derived from the Flagship dimensions but applied as hard floors.

2. **80% creative authority.** The prompt explicitly allocates 80% creative authority to the builder, constraining only 20%. This is the direct response to the Recipe Paradox — less specification, more creative space.

3. **Perception thresholds as binary gates.** 120px stacked gap max, 0.025em letter-spacing floor, 15 RGB background delta — all codified as pass/fail gates, not guidelines.

4. **Conventions brief format.** 230-line hybrid format providing 80% creative authority / 20% constraint. This is the PROCEDURAL format (ceiling 3.0-3.5/4) — better than specification but still below dispositional.

5. **WHY:** Each addition directly addresses a root cause from the Flagship failure. The prompt is the pipeline's attempt to encode enough Flagship knowledge to reach 3.0-3.5/4 while avoiding the compression that destroyed the 963-line version.

## Summary: The Flagship 4/4 Evolution Stack

Each phase added layers that CD-006 satisfies naturally but the pipeline must explicitly codify:

| Phase | Key Addition | CD-006 had it? | Pipeline must codify it? |
|-------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 0 | 41 mechanisms, 5 scales, 39/40 | Yes (naturally) | Yes (as D-01, D-05) |
| 1 | Two-register PA-05 distinction | N/A | Yes (Middle vs Flagship 4/4) |
| 2 | Perception thresholds | Yes (naturally perceptible) | Yes (15 RGB, 2px, 0.025em) |
| 3 | Recipe format over checklist | N/A (no prompt at all) | Yes (builder recipe) |
| 4 | Builder cognitive modes | COMPOSING (naturally) | Must create conditions for it |
| 5 | Repair ceiling = 2.5/4 | N/A | Anti-pattern knowledge |
| 6 | Compression ratio limits | N/A (no compression) | Yes (70-150 line optimal) |
| 7 | 14 binary dimensions | Passes ~8-10/14 | Yes (all 14 as gates) |
| 7 | D-04 global multi-coherence | FAIL (~1-2 instances) | Yes (>= 3 instances) |
| 7 | D-13 unified structural metaphor | FAIL (~1/8 sections) | Yes (ALL sections) |
| 7 | Tier 5 PA questions | Would score ~5-6/8 | Yes (>= 6/8) |
| 7 | Anti-scale model | All three factors naturally | Yes (as multiplicative gates) |
| 7 | Quality suppressor neutralization | No suppressors active | Must avoid all 5 absolute |
| 8 | 80% creative authority | 100% creative authority | Yes (explicit allocation) |
| 8 | Quality floors (14 mechanisms, 800+ CSS) | Far exceeds | Yes (hard floors) |

---

## The Central Paradox

CD-006 achieves CEILING naturally because a single Opus builder with full creative authority and deep design-system understanding simply COMPOSED a page. No rules, no thresholds, no compression.

The Flagship 4/4 standard is everything CD-006 is PLUS:
- **D-03 raised:** avg >= 4 channels/boundary (CD-006 = 3.36)
- **D-04 added:** >= 3 global multi-coherence instances (CD-006 = ~1-2)
- **D-13 added:** unified structural metaphor across ALL sections (CD-006 = ~1/8)
- **Tier 5 added:** atmospheric integration questions (CD-006 would score ~5-6/8)

But the pipeline cannot achieve even CD-006's level because it COMPRESSES the very compositional intelligence that made CD-006 possible. The evolution is thus paradoxical: each phase adds more knowledge about what Flagship requires, but that knowledge — when encoded as rules — makes achieving Flagship HARDER, not easier.

**The Flagship 4/4 standard may only be achievable by an agent that has INTERNALIZED the design system deeply enough to operate in DISPOSITIONAL mode — composing from understanding rather than complying with specification. This is what CD-006's builder did naturally. The pipeline's challenge is creating the conditions for that internalization without destroying it through compression.**

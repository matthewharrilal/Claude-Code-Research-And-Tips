# 25 -- Flagship 4/4 Definition Taint Audit: Was the Standard Constructed From CD-006's Shadow?

**Agent:** taint-auditor (Opus 4.6)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Task:** #48
**Files examined:** 14 files from `ephemeral/flagship-44-recipe/` (01-DEFINITION, 03-CD006-FORENSICS, 04-CONDITIONS, 05-ANTI-CONDITIONS, 06-COMP-INTEL-CONDITIONS, 08-VERIFICATION-SPEC, 11-CONTRARIAN, 12-SYNTHESIS, 18-SCALES-DEEP-DIVE, 19-CHANNELS-DEEP-DIVE, 20-MULTI-COHERENCE-DEEP-DIVE, 21-ANTI-SCALE-DEEP-DIVE, 22-FRACTAL-DEEP-DIVE, 23-STACK-INTEGRATION)

---

## THE HYPOTHESIS UNDER TEST

**Strong taint:** Flagship 4/4 was defined as "CD-006 + what CD-006 lacks." The 14 dimensions are gap analysis, not first principles. The definition cannot escape CD-006 because it was CONSTRUCTED relative to it.

**No taint:** Flagship was derived from independent quality theory (Alexander, Salingaros, compositional intelligence stack, anti-scale model). CD-006 was studied forensically but did not determine the standard.

---

## PART 1: PER-DIMENSION TAINT ANALYSIS

### D-01: Mechanism Count and Category Coverage (>=14, 2/cat)

**How derived:** The mechanism catalog (18 mechanisms across 5-7 categories) was developed PRIOR to the Flagship definition, from the tension-composition skill and Phase C extraction (19 agents, 42 files, 6-layer ontology). The catalog was a codification of CSS techniques observed across 30+ explorations, not a CD-006 product. The per-category minimum was a MEMORY.md finding from the richness+rigidity research ("change 'sample 2-4' to per-category minimums").

**CD-006 references:** Report 01 uses CD-006's 18/18 score as evidence value. Report 03 provides the exhaustive mechanism inventory (41 instances across 7 categories). The >=14 threshold is set to exclude Middle (12) and include CD-006 (18). But the catalog PREDATES CD-006's analysis.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** YES. The mechanism catalog was built from research phases R1-R5 (337 findings) and codified in Phase C. CD-006 demonstrated the catalog's full deployment, but the catalog itself is independently derived.

**Taint level: CLEAN.** The mechanism catalog and category structure are independent of CD-006. The >=14 threshold draws on CD-006 as a data point but is set by the Middle-to-Flagship gap, not by CD-006's specific score.

---

### D-02: Zone Transitions (>=8, 2+ channels)

**How derived:** Report 01 states the threshold comes from "scale research (5 scales need 8+ boundaries to manifest)." The Alexander/Salingaros formula (`ln(1440/12)/ln(2.7) = 4.8 ~= 5 scales`) is the theoretical foundation. 5 scales require at least 4 boundaries between them; >=8 transitions means each boundary type appears at least once.

**CD-006 references:** "CD-006 has 7 transitions at 2-3 channels. No page has 8 at 2+ channels each" (Report 01, D-02). CD-006 actually FALLS SHORT of the Flagship threshold (7 < 8), which is notable -- the threshold was set ABOVE CD-006's actual value.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** YES. The 5-scale model comes from architectural theory. The transition count is a mathematical consequence of scale depth. CD-006's 7 transitions provided a calibration point, but the requirement to exceed that value means the definition is NOT anchored to CD-006.

**Taint level: CLEAN.** Derived from scale theory, not gap analysis. CD-006 actually fails this threshold.

---

### D-03: Channels Active per Boundary (>=3, avg >=4) [F-ONLY]

**How derived:** Report 19 defines 6 CSS property families (Chromatic, Typographic, Spatial, Structural, Behavioral, Material). The 6-channel taxonomy was derived from examining what properties CHANGE at boundaries. The >=3 threshold comes from the theoretical claim that multi-coherence requires 3+ simultaneous signals.

**CD-006 references:** "CD-006: Average 4.3 channels/boundary (range 3-5)" (Report 01, D-03). This is THE primary calibration data point. The "avg >= 4" threshold is DIRECTLY derived from CD-006's 4.3 average. Report 19 confirms: CD-006's channel counts are the primary evidence for what "good" looks like.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** PARTIALLY. The concept of multi-channel shifting as a quality indicator would exist from perceptual psychology (humans perceive zone changes more strongly when multiple modalities shift simultaneously). But the SPECIFIC thresholds (>=3 per boundary, avg >=4) are calibrated entirely from CD-006. Without CD-006, we would not know what average to target.

**Taint level: INFLUENCED.** The concept is independently derived; the specific thresholds are CD-006-calibrated.

---

### D-04: Multi-Coherence (>=3 instances) [F-ONLY]

**How derived:** Multi-coherence is the concept that 3+ channels encode the SAME semantic concept simultaneously. Report 20 traces this concept to the compositional intelligence stack's L4 layer. The >=3 instances threshold appears in Report 01 without clear derivation -- it is presented as a THEORETICAL requirement.

**CD-006 references:** Report 01 says "CD-006: ~5 instances" then immediately argues these are LOCAL not GLOBAL. Report 20 traces 6+ CD-006 multi-coherence instances and then redefines them as "not really multi-coherence" because they are section-scoped rather than metaphor-unified. The ENTIRE discourse around D-04 is shaped by CD-006: the concept is illustrated through CD-006 examples, then the threshold is set to EXCLUDE CD-006's local approach and REQUIRE something CD-006 lacks (global coherence).

**Would this exist without CD-006?** THE CONCEPT would exist -- it has theoretical roots in Gestalt perception (multiple concurrent signals create stronger impressions). But the SPECIFIC distinction between "local" and "global" multi-coherence was INVENTED to reclassify CD-006 from Flagship to Ceiling. Without CD-006, there would be no need to distinguish local from global -- "3+ channels at boundaries" would suffice.

**Taint level: TAINTED.** The local/global distinction that defines D-04's Flagship threshold is CD-006 gap analysis. It was created specifically to ensure CD-006 fails this gate while a hypothetical "better page" passes.

---

### D-05: Fractal Self-Similarity (5/5 scales) [different thresholds]

**How derived:** Report 18 derives the 5-scale model from Alexander/Salingaros: `ln(1440/12)/ln(2.7) = 4.8`. This is genuinely independent theoretical work. The 5 scales (Navigation, Page, Section, Component, Character) are named from architectural zoom levels.

**CD-006 references:** Report 03 confirms CD-006 achieves 5/5 scales. Report 18 uses CD-006 as the primary example at every scale. Report 22 provides the fractal deep dive using CD-006's CSS as the working example throughout. The 5/5 requirement for Flagship comes from CD-006 demonstrating it is achievable.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** YES, as a concept. The Alexander/Salingaros theory would still produce 5 scales. But without CD-006 proving all 5 are achievable in CSS, the threshold might have been set at 3/5 or 4/5 (the "realistic minimum" that Report 22 itself suggests). CD-006's demonstration raised the bar.

**Taint level: INFLUENCED.** Theory is independent; achievability calibration draws on CD-006.

---

### D-06: Semantic Density (<=96px gap, >=40% content ratio)

**How derived:** The maximum gap threshold comes from the Flagship experiment's FAILURE (6 whitespace voids of 210-276px). The <=96px Flagship threshold and <=120px Middle threshold are derived from the S-09 stacking analysis in the remediation audit. The >=40% content-to-whitespace ratio is a design industry standard adapted for the design system.

**CD-006 references:** "CD-006: Max gap ~80px" (Report 01). CD-006's 80px gap provides evidence that <=96px is achievable. But the threshold was primarily motivated by the Flagship FAILURE (excessive whitespace), not by CD-006's success.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** YES. Whitespace void prevention is a basic design principle. The specific 96px number was shaped more by the Flagship failure than by CD-006.

**Taint level: CLEAN.** Derived from failure analysis and design standards, not CD-006 gap analysis.

---

### D-07: Perceptibility Floor (>=15 RGB, etc.)

**How derived:** The perception thresholds emerged from the Mode 4 PA of the Flagship experiment, where 9/9 auditors independently flagged imperceptible backgrounds (1-8 RGB) and uniform typography. The >=15 RGB threshold is a practical estimate based on the Flagship failure analysis. Report 19 notes the threshold was already proposed in memory (MEMORY.md).

**CD-006 references:** Report 21 reveals that "CD-006 FAILS the >= 15 RGB zone background threshold on 2 of 3 zone pairs." CD-006 backgrounds differ by 8-10 RGB. This is a COUNTER-TAINT finding: the perceptibility floor was set at a level that CD-006's own backgrounds partially fail. The definition was NOT designed to match CD-006 on this dimension.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** YES. The Flagship's catastrophic failure (1-8 RGB backgrounds) would have motivated perceptibility floors regardless of CD-006. The specific >=15 RGB value comes from perceptual reasoning about minimum discriminable differences, not from CD-006.

**Taint level: CLEAN.** Derived from Flagship failure analysis. CD-006 actually FAILS part of this gate, proving it was not CD-006-tailored.

---

### D-08: Restraint Indicators

**How derived:** Report 21 (Anti-Scale Deep Dive) develops restraint as one of three multiplicative factors in the Richness equation. The concept of "deliberate exclusion" as quality evidence comes from design theory (Dieter Rams, Braun design principles -- less is more). The specific indicators (zero sub-perceptual CSS, deliberate mechanism exclusion, component type caps) are operationalized from the anti-scale model.

**CD-006 references:** Report 03 Section 5 provides exhaustive "Restraint Analysis: Where CD-006 Holds Back" -- documenting 12 things CD-006 deliberately chose NOT to do (gradients, shadows, animations, etc.). CD-006's 40% mechanism withholding rate is the PRIMARY calibration for what restraint looks like. The "deliberate exclusion of >= 1 catalog mechanism" requirement for Flagship is directly modeled on CD-006's restraint pattern.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** THE CONCEPT would exist from design theory. But the specific operationalization (mechanism exclusion log, 35% component cap, sub-perceptual CSS check) is modeled on CD-006's specific restraint behaviors. Without CD-006, we would know "restraint matters" but not what restraint looks like in THIS design system.

**Taint level: INFLUENCED.** Theory is independent; operationalization is CD-006-modeled.

---

### D-09: Axis Pattern Variety (>=3 of 5) [F-ONLY]

**How derived:** The 5 axis patterns (Z-Pattern, F-Pattern, Bento Grid, Spiral, Choreography) were codified in the mechanism catalog from research Phases R1-R5. They existed as a design system vocabulary BEFORE CD-006.

**CD-006 references:** "CD-006: All 5 patterns used across 8 sections. 7 named transitions" (Report 01). The >=3 threshold is set well below CD-006's 5/5. But CD-006 is the ONLY artifact that has ever deployed all 5 patterns, and the concept that a page SHOULD use multiple patterns (rather than repeating one) was established by observing CD-006's superiority over the Middle experiment (which used F-Pattern throughout).

**Would this exist without CD-006?** PARTIALLY. The axis patterns exist independently. But the requirement for VARIETY (>=3 per page) is directly derived from comparing CD-006 (5 patterns, 39/40) to Middle (1 pattern, 4/4). Without that comparison, "variety" might not have been a stated requirement -- a well-executed single pattern might have been considered sufficient.

**Taint level: INFLUENCED.** Vocabulary is independent; variety requirement is CD-006-derived from comparative analysis.

---

### D-10: Designed Moments per Scroll (>=90%)

**How derived:** The concept of "designed moments" comes from Mies van der Rohe's principle that every element should be intentional. The coverage metric (viewport segments with at least one designed moment / total segments) is an original operationalization for web pages.

**CD-006 references:** "CD-006: ~100% coverage" (Report 01). The Flagship's ~15% coverage was the failure case. The >=90% Flagship threshold is set between CD-006 (100%) and Middle (80-85%). Without CD-006, the threshold would likely be >=75% (the Middle-level gate).

**Would this exist without CD-006?** YES as a concept. The specific >=90% threshold is positioned between CD-006 and Middle, suggesting calibration from both. Not purely CD-006-derived.

**Taint level: INFLUENCED.** Concept independent; threshold calibration uses CD-006 and Middle.

---

### D-11: Component Variety (>=8 types, <=35% single type)

**How derived:** The component library (34 components across multiple types) was developed in the design system independently of CD-006. The >=8 types threshold is set to require about half the library's type diversity.

**CD-006 references:** "CD-006: 11 types, 33 instances" (Report 01). CD-006's 11 types provide the upper calibration. The <=35% dominance cap is directly derived from CD-006's callout variant system (5 callout types prevent any single type from dominating).

**Would this exist without CD-006?** YES for the concept and the component library. The <=35% dominance cap is CD-006-inspired (its callout variant strategy is the specific solution being generalized).

**Taint level: INFLUENCED.** Library is independent; dominance cap is CD-006-modeled.

---

### D-12: CSS Quantitative Features (600-1500 lines, etc.)

**How derived:** These are basic CSS metrics. The ranges were calibrated from the 4 experiments (CD-006 at ~999, Middle at ~350-500, Flagship at ~700, Remediation at ~650).

**CD-006 references:** CD-006's ~999 CSS lines defines the upper-middle of the Flagship range (600-1500). The specific selector counts, custom property counts, and breakpoint requirements are directly modeled on CD-006's CSS profile (Report 03 provides exhaustive counts).

**Would this exist without CD-006?** The concept of "enough CSS to express compositional complexity" would exist. The specific ranges are calibrated primarily from CD-006 and Middle. Without CD-006, we would lack a reference for what "enough" looks like.

**Taint level: INFLUENCED.** Concept obvious; specific ranges are CD-006-calibrated.

---

### D-13: Metaphor Presence (structural, not textual) [F-ONLY]

**How derived:** This is THE most contested dimension. Report 01 acknowledges: "THEORETICAL NOTE: No existing page demonstrates D-13 at Flagship level." The concept is derived from the tension-composition skill's theory about structural metaphor and from the Flagship experiment's failure (assay laboratory metaphor that produced zero CSS manifestation).

**CD-006 references:** Report 01 on D-13 states: "CD-006 has local metaphors (Ceiling)." The ENTIRE distinction between "local metaphors" (CD-006) and "unified structural metaphor" (Flagship) was created to draw a line that CD-006 falls below. The 40% structural manifestation threshold is described as a "GUESS based on what CD-006 achieves locally."

The contrarian (Report 11, Challenge 3) identifies this explicitly: "By labeling it 'Ceiling, NOT Flagship,' the team preserves a large gap between current achievement and goal, justifying continued investigation." The team needed D-13 to FAIL CD-006 because CD-006 passes D-01 through D-12.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** THE CONCEPT of metaphor-driven design exists in architecture (Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language, Frank Lloyd Wright's organic architecture). But the SPECIFIC distinction between "local metaphors per section" (acceptable at Ceiling) and "unified metaphor across all sections" (required for Flagship) was INVENTED to create a tier above CD-006. Without CD-006 as the reference point for "excellent but not enough," this distinction would have no motivation.

**Taint level: TAINTED.** This dimension was specifically engineered to create a gap above CD-006. The 40% threshold is acknowledged as a guess. The local/global distinction serves a rhetorical purpose.

---

### D-14: Accessibility Baseline

**How derived:** WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Completely independent of CD-006.

**Would this exist without CD-006?** YES.

**Taint level: CLEAN.**

---

## PART 2: SUCCESS BAR ANALYSIS

### PA-05 >= 3.5 -- Anchored to CD-006?

The PA-05 scale (1-4) was developed as part of the perceptual auditing skill and predates the Flagship definition. The 4-point anchoring (DEFAULT/STYLED/COMPOSED/DESIGNED) comes from perceptual psychology applied to web design.

The >=3.5 threshold was raised from >=3.0 specifically to exclude Middle 4/4 from qualifying as Flagship. Report 08 states: "PA-05 3/4 = COMPOSED. A Middle page can achieve 3/4 with good mechanism deployment." The threshold increase is designed to require something MORE than Middle -- but the only data point above Middle is CD-006.

**Taint level: INFLUENCED.** The scale is independent; the >=3.5 threshold is calibrated by the need to exceed Middle's range, with CD-006 as implicit reference for "what exceeding Middle looks like."

### Tier 5 >= 6/8 -- Designed to catch what CD-006 misses?

YES, explicitly. Report 08 states: "Tier 5 measures compositional depth ABOVE the designed threshold. It is the ONLY instrument that answers: 'Is this Flagship-tier or Middle-tier?'" The 8 Tier 5 questions (PA-60 through PA-67) were designed from the compositional intelligence stack, which was itself derived partly from CD-006 forensics.

The contrarian (Report 11, Challenge 2) identifies circularity: "we define quality as 'the stack operating,' then create questions that detect 'the stack operating,' then conclude that quality = the stack operating."

However, the Tier 5 questions themselves are not CD-006-specific. PA-60 asks about "design moments," PA-61 about "independent rhythms," PA-62 about "transition variation," PA-63 about "fractal coherence," PA-64 about "deliberate plainness," PA-65 about "musical ensemble vs choir," PA-66 about "negative space variety," PA-67 about "novelty." These are PERCEPTUAL questions that any fresh-eyes observer could answer about any page. They are grounded in perception, not in CD-006 properties.

**Taint level: INFLUENCED but not TAINTED.** The questions detect the stack, which was partly derived from CD-006. But the questions themselves are perceptually grounded and would be valid even if CD-006 never existed.

### Metaphor STRUCTURAL -- Defined as "what CD-006 doesn't have"?

YES. This criterion exists specifically because CD-006 has "announced" metaphor (geological labels) but not "structural" metaphor (CSS that embodies geological principles without labels). The STRUCTURAL requirement is the definitional gap between CD-006 and Flagship.

**Taint level: TAINTED.** This is the clearest case of CD-006 gap analysis defining the standard.

---

## PART 3: DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS

### Were scales derived from theory or from CD-006?

Report 18 derives the 5-scale model from Alexander/Salingaros's mathematical formula. This is genuine independent theory. However, the CONCRETE CSS expression at each scale (what "Navigation scale" looks like, what "Component scale" looks like) is entirely illustrated through CD-006's CSS. Report 22's fractal deep dive uses CD-006 as the working example at every single scale.

**Verdict:** Theory is CLEAN. CSS operationalization is INFLUENCED by CD-006 as the only artifact demonstrating all 5 scales.

### Were channels derived from theory or from CD-006?

Report 19 defines 6 channels by examining "what properties CHANGE at boundaries in CD-006." The contrarian (Report 11, Challenge 15) identifies this: "The channel taxonomy was not derived from perceptual psychology or CSS specification structure. It was derived from examining what properties CHANGE at boundaries in CD-006." An alternative 4-channel taxonomy would capture the same CSS properties differently.

**Verdict: INFLUENCED.** The 6-channel taxonomy is a CD-006 forensic product, not an independent theoretical framework.

### Were multi-coherence thresholds derived from theory or from CD-006?

The concept of multi-coherence (multiple signals reinforcing the same message) has roots in Gestalt perception theory. But the specific operationalization -- counting channels per boundary, requiring >=3 per boundary, requiring avg >=4 -- is calibrated entirely from CD-006's boundary analysis (Report 03 Section 2 maps all 11 boundaries with channel counts).

**Verdict: INFLUENCED.** Concept is theoretically grounded; thresholds are CD-006-calibrated.

### Was anti-scale derived from theory or from CD-006?

The anti-scale formula (Richness = semantic density x restraint x spatial confidence) comes from the scale research team's investigation, predating the Flagship definition work. However, Report 21's operationalization uses CD-006 as the calibration data for EVERY metric: semantic density ratio (CD-006 = 0.049), restraint ratio (CD-006 = 40% withheld), spatial confidence (CD-006's grids and borders as reference).

The contrarian (Report 11, Challenge 9) nails this: "The anti-scale model does not EVALUATE quality -- it measures SIMILARITY TO CD-006."

**Verdict: INFLUENCED.** The formula is independently derived; the metrics measure similarity to CD-006.

### Taint Distribution

- **CLEAN:** 4 dimensions (D-01, D-02, D-06, D-07, D-14) = 5/14 = 36%
- **INFLUENCED:** 7 dimensions (D-03, D-05, D-08, D-09, D-10, D-11, D-12) = 7/14 = 50%
- **TAINTED:** 2 dimensions (D-04, D-13) = 2/14 = 14%

---

## PART 5: VERDICT

### 1. Taint Percentage

**~14% of the Flagship definition is genuine CD-006 gap analysis** (D-04 local-vs-global multi-coherence, D-13 unified-vs-local metaphor). These two dimensions are the CORE of what makes Flagship "different from Ceiling" and they were specifically engineered to create a gap above CD-006.

**~50% is CD-006-influenced** -- concepts that have independent theoretical foundations but whose specific thresholds, operationalizations, and examples are calibrated from CD-006 forensics.

**~36% is genuinely clean** -- derived from independent theory, failure analysis, or design standards, with CD-006 serving only as evidence that thresholds are achievable.

### 2. Does the Taint Matter?

**For the INFLUENCED dimensions: NO, the taint does not invalidate them.** Using your best artifact as a calibration reference is STANDARD methodology. When creating a quality standard, you examine what excellence looks like and set thresholds accordingly. CD-006 being the primary calibration artifact is inevitable and appropriate -- it is the best page we have. The theoretical foundations of these dimensions are sound regardless of calibration.

**For the TAINTED dimensions: YES, the taint matters significantly.** D-04 and D-13 are the two dimensions that DEFINE the Flagship-Ceiling gap. They were specifically created to ensure CD-006 fails and something hypothetically better passes. This is problematic for three reasons:

1. **Circular definition:** "Flagship is better than CD-006 because it has what CD-006 lacks" is not a quality standard -- it is a comparative statement. It tells us nothing about what quality looks like, only what CD-006 looks like minus.

2. **Unfalsifiable target:** Since D-04 (global multi-coherence) and D-13 (unified structural metaphor) have NEVER been observed, we do not know if they are even perceptible to readers. The definition asserts they matter but provides zero perceptual evidence. A page could pass all 14 dimensions and feel identical to CD-006 -- we would not know because the experiment has never been run.

3. **Goalpost engineering:** The contrarian (Report 11, Challenge 3) correctly identifies that "the team moved the goalposts. The definition was written to ensure CD-006 fails." D-13 in particular was added AS A 14th DIMENSION specifically because CD-006 passes the original 12.

### 3. What Would a CD-006-Free Flagship Look Like?

If we threw out every dimension derived from CD-006 gap analysis and kept only first-principles dimensions:

**SURVIVING (CLEAN + theoretical foundations of INFLUENCED):**
- Mechanism count and category coverage (from design vocabulary theory)
- Zone transitions with perceptible channel shifts (from scale theory)
- Multi-channel boundary shifts (from perception theory -- without the local/global distinction)
- Fractal self-similarity (from Alexander/Salingaros -- but perhaps at 3/5 rather than 5/5)
- Semantic density / no whitespace voids (from design fundamentals)
- Perceptibility floor (from psychophysics)
- Restraint (from design theory)
- Axis pattern variety (from layout diversity theory)
- Designed moments coverage (from design fundamentals)
- Component variety (from design vocabulary)
- CSS quantitative features (basic complexity measure)
- Accessibility (from WCAG)

**DISCARDED:**
- D-04 as currently stated (replace "global multi-coherence via unified metaphor" with "multi-coherence instances, local or global, count equally")
- D-13 as currently stated (replace "unified structural metaphor" with "at least one compositional metaphor that manifests in CSS, scope not prescribed")

**What changes:** The CD-006-free Flagship definition would be EASIER to achieve. CD-006 itself would pass 12-13 of 14 dimensions rather than 10-11. The gap between Ceiling and Flagship would narrow from "qualitative register shift requiring global metaphor" to "quantitative improvement requiring more of what already works."

**The uncomfortable implication:** Without D-04 (global) and D-13 (unified), there is NO qualitative distinction between Ceiling and Flagship. The definition collapses into a continuous spectrum from "fewer mechanisms and scales" to "more mechanisms and scales." The discrete register that the Flagship definition claims to identify may be an artifact of the CD-006 gap analysis that created D-04 and D-13.

### 4. Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: KEEP the CLEAN and INFLUENCED dimensions.** They are well-founded and practically useful. CD-006 calibration is appropriate methodology, not taint.

**Recommendation 2: REVISE D-04 to remove the local/global distinction.** Count multi-coherence instances regardless of whether they serve a single unified metaphor or multiple local metaphors. CD-006's local multi-coherence IS multi-coherence. The distinction was engineered to exclude CD-006, not to measure quality.

**Revised D-04:** ">=3 instances where >=3 channels encode the same semantic concept simultaneously, whether unified across the page or concentrated in specific sections."

**Recommendation 3: REVISE D-13 to remove the unified requirement.** A page with strong local metaphors per section (CD-006's approach) should not be penalized versus a page with one unified metaphor. Both are valid compositional strategies.

**Revised D-13:** "At least one compositional metaphor manifests in CSS (not just text labels). The metaphor creates at least 2 class name families NOT in the mechanism catalog. At least 30% of sections show metaphor influence WITHOUT textual labeling."

**Recommendation 4: ACCEPT that Flagship may be the upper end of a continuous spectrum, not a discrete register.** The contrarian (Report 11, Challenge 1) is likely correct. Remove the "qualitatively different mode" framing and replace with "highest achievable quality on a continuous scale." This is more honest and avoids the goalpost engineering problem.

**Recommendation 5: TEST before theorizing further.** Build pages. If a page passes all 14 dimensions (revised) and PA auditors independently describe it as qualitatively different from CD-006, the discrete register exists. If they describe it as "similar quality, maybe slightly better," the register is taxonomic fiction. Only empirical evidence can resolve this.

---

## PART 6: THE DEEPEST FINDING

The Flagship 4/4 definition is **approximately 64% tainted-or-influenced by CD-006** (9 INFLUENCED + 2 TAINTED out of 14 dimensions). However, this framing overstates the problem. The real structure is:

- **The 12 quantitative dimensions (D-01 through D-12, D-14) are well-founded.** Even where CD-006-influenced, they measure real properties with independent theoretical support. These should be kept with minor threshold calibration.

- **The 2 qualitative dimensions (D-04 global, D-13 unified) are CD-006 gap analysis.** They were created to make CD-006 fail so that "Flagship" would name something CD-006 is not. They should be revised to measure what they claim to measure (multi-coherence quality, metaphor presence) without the CD-006-excluding modifiers.

**The definition's greatest strength** is its honesty. Report 01 opens with "Flagship 4/4 has NEVER been achieved" and labels each dimension's epistemic status (PROVEN/EXTRAPOLATED/THEORETICAL). The two TAINTED dimensions are both labeled THEORETICAL. The self-awareness is there. What is missing is the next step: acknowledging that THEORETICAL dimensions derived from gap analysis of a single artifact are HYPOTHESES, not quality requirements, and should be treated as such until empirically validated.

**The definition's greatest weakness** is that it conflates "different from CD-006" with "better than CD-006." A page with a unified structural metaphor and global multi-coherence might not be BETTER than CD-006 -- it would just be DIFFERENT. Quality and difference are not the same thing. The Flagship definition assumes they are.

**END OF TAINT AUDIT**

**Summary statistics:**
- 14 files read (~4,500 lines)
- 14 dimensions audited
- Taint distribution: 36% CLEAN, 50% INFLUENCED, 14% TAINTED
- 2 dimensions recommended for revision (D-04, D-13)
- Core finding: the Flagship-Ceiling distinction rests on 2 dimensions that are CD-006 gap analysis, not independent quality theory
- The definition is USEFUL and MOSTLY SOUND, but the "qualitatively different register" claim is not supported by first-principles reasoning

# CD-006 Framing Cross-Validation Audit

**Auditor:** cross-validation-auditor (Opus)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**First audit:** `20-cd006-framing-audit.md` (framing-auditor)
**Scope:** Independent cross-validation of ALL 27 files in `_comparison-screenshots/`
**Method:** Read every report independently, classified each, THEN compared against first audit

---

## Executive Summary

The first audit's findings are **CONFIRMED in full**. Every severity classification is correct. Every clean report is correctly identified as clean. Every cross-cutting finding is substantiated.

This cross-validation adds **5 findings** the first audit could not have identified (it predated reports 21-26 and 29), plus **3 systemic observations** about contamination persistence.

**Agreement rate with first audit: 100%** on all reports both audits cover (01-19).

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Location | Section 5 scoring dimension |
| Error type | CD-006 as quality label + scoring dimension |
| Specifics | "Crown jewel resonance" as a scoring dimension (7/10 and 9/10). "CD-006 contemporary" and "CD-006 younger sibling" as quality labels. |

| Framing correction | YES — reframes kinship target to DESIGN SYSTEM PRINCIPLES |
| First audit agreement | **FULL** — classified HIGH by both audits |

#### MEDIUM (2)

**Report 13 — Design Intelligence Traceability (`13-design-traceability.md`, 380 lines)**

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Location | Line 16/87, Line 134 |
| Error type | Label contamination |
| Specifics | "Crown jewel divergence" label for CD-006. 39/40 score used parenthetically as quality validation. |
| Impact | LOW — core provenance methodology is independent |
| Framing correction | YES — relabels to "CEILING-tier exploration" |
| First audit agreement | **FULL** — classified MEDIUM by both audits |

## Part 2: Contamination Sources Beyond Reports

### MEMORY.md

**Status: CONTAMINATED**

Contains "CD-006 crown jewel 39/40" in the phase history section. This line is auto-loaded into every agent conversation context, serving as the ROOT of the contamination chain. Every agent spawned in this project inherits the framing that CD-006 is a "crown jewel" before reading any reports.

### design-system/CLAUDE.md

**Status: CONTAMINATED (3 instances)**

| Line | Content | Severity |
|------|---------|----------|
| ~143 | "crown jewel: DD-006 fractal" | MEDIUM — applies "crown jewel" label to a density exploration |
| ~145 | "crown jewel: CD-006 pilot, 39/40 score" | HIGH — directly names CD-006 as crown jewel with quality score |
| ~655 | "Validated Explorations (Crown Jewels)" as section header | MEDIUM — normalizes "crown jewel" as standard vocabulary |

This file is AUTO-LOADED for every agent working in the design-system directory. It functions as the second link in the contamination chain after MEMORY.md.

### design-system/compositional-core/CLAUDE.md

**Status: CLEAN** — No direct CD-006 benchmark framing found. References to CD-006 are procedural (referencing it as a case study file) rather than evaluative.

### Gate Runner (gate-runner.md)

**Status: OPERATIONALLY CONTAMINATED** — Uses CD-006 as a calibration standard for gate evaluation. Per reports 24 and 29, this embeds CD-006's characteristics as the operational definition of quality in the pipeline itself. This is a deeper form of contamination than label usage because it shapes what the pipeline PRODUCES, not just how it is described.

### Case Study File

**Status: STRUCTURALLY EMBEDDED** — A 380-line detailed CD-006 case study exists in the compositional core. This is APPROPRIATE as a reference artifact but becomes contamination when the case study is the ONLY detailed exemplar and agents extrapolate from it to define quality.

---

## Part 3: Comparison with First Audit

### Full Agreement (19/19 reports in shared scope)

Every report the first audit classified (01-19), this cross-validation classifies identically:

- **CLEAN:** 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 10, 12 — CONFIRMED
- **CRITICAL:** 09, 11 — CONFIRMED
- **HIGH:** 17, 19 — CONFIRMED
- **MEDIUM:** 08, 13, 18 — CONFIRMED (minor: I rate 08 as LOW within the first audit's MEDIUM band)
- **CORRECT:** 14, 15 — CONFIRMED
- **No CD-006 refs:** 16 — CONFIRMED

### No Disagreements

There are zero cases where this audit contradicts the first audit's severity classification or clean/contaminated determination. The first audit's analytical framework (explicit vs implicit framing, scoring-as-fraction as most dangerous pattern, philosophical reports as most contaminated category) is fully substantiated by independent re-reading.

### Additional Scope (8 reports not in first audit)

Reports 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29 were written AFTER the first audit and were not in its scope. All are either CORRECT, CLEAN, or administrative:

| Report | Status | Significance |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 21 | CORRECT | Post-correction synthesis with proper framing |
| 22 | Administrative | Corrections log |
| 23 | CORRECT | Flagship evolution with proper tier placement |
| 24 | CORRECT | Meta-analysis of WHY contamination persists |
| 25 | CORRECT | Taint audit of Flagship definition itself |
| 26 | CLEAN | First-principles assessment, zero CD-006 refs |
| 29 | CLEAN | Pipeline transmission audit, no benchmarking |

This pattern — all newer reports have correct framing — suggests the first audit and correction process were EFFECTIVE for subsequent analytical work.

---

## Part 4: Additional Findings

These findings extend beyond the first audit's scope.

### Finding A-1: Flagship Definition Contains Tainted Dimensions

Report 25 reveals that the Flagship 4/4 definition itself contains CD-006 contamination:

- **D-04 (Multi-coherence):** Specifically engineered as CD-006 gap analysis. The dimension exists because CD-006 has LOCAL multi-coherence but not GLOBAL.
- **D-13 (Unified pervading metaphor):** Specifically engineered as CD-006 gap analysis. The dimension exists because CD-006 LACKS a unified metaphor.

This means 14% of the Flagship definition (2/14 dimensions) were reverse-engineered from CD-006's specific gaps rather than derived from first principles. Even if every report's framing is corrected, the DEFINITION itself carries CD-006's shape.

**Severity: STRUCTURAL** — deeper than any individual report's framing error because it affects the target, not just the measurement.

### Finding A-2: Contamination Chain Traced Through Auto-Loaded Files

Report 24 identifies the full contamination chain:

```
MEMORY.md ("crown jewel 39/40")
  → design-system/CLAUDE.md ("crown jewel: CD-006 pilot")
    → gate-runner.md (CD-006 as calibration standard)
      → case study (380-line detailed exemplar)
        → ALL spawned agents inherit this framing
```

The contamination is ARCHITECTURAL, not incidental. Auto-loaded files ensure every agent in this project starts with CD-006 framing before encountering any corrective context.

### Finding A-3: Corrections Are Addenda, Not Modifications

The 7 corrections applied (documented in report 22) are all APPENDED sections labeled "FRAMING CORRECTION (2026-02-22)." The original contaminated text remains intact and readable. This means:

1. An agent reading report 09 Section 5 will encounter "CROWN JEWEL COMPARISON" with pages scored as percentages of CD-006 BEFORE encountering the correction at the end.
2. The primacy effect (first information encountered anchors reasoning) means the original framing may still influence analysis even with the correction present.
3. For reports 09 and 11 (CRITICAL), the original framing is extensive (multiple sections, repeated patterns) while the correction is a single paragraph.

**Effectiveness assessment:** The addendum approach preserves provenance (valuable) but does not eliminate contamination for agents that read reports top-to-bottom and may not reach the addendum, or that anchor on the first framing encountered.

### Finding A-4: Gate Runner as Operational Contamination

Unlike report-level framing (which affects analysis), the gate runner's use of CD-006 as a calibration standard affects PRODUCTION. Every page built through the pipeline has its quality assessed against CD-006 characteristics. This is the most consequential contamination because it shapes what gets built, not just what gets said about what was built.

Reports 24 and 29 both identify this independently, adding confidence to the finding.

### Finding A-5: Post-Audit Reports Show Effective Decontamination

All 7 reports written after the first audit (21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29) demonstrate correct tier vocabulary and proper CD-006 placement. This is strong evidence that the first audit and correction process successfully shifted the analytical frame for SUBSEQUENT work, even if the corrections to existing reports are imperfect (per Finding A-3).

---

## Part 5: Cross-Cutting Findings

### C-1: Philosophical Reports Are Most Contaminated (CONFIRMED)

The first audit identified this pattern and it is fully confirmed:

- Reports 09 (richness philosophy) and 11 (metacognitive quality): CRITICAL
- Reports 17 (soul resonance) and 19 (personality test): HIGH
- Quantitative/dimensional reports (01-07): ALL CLEAN

The explanation is straightforward: philosophical analysis requires a quality standard to reason AGAINST. When the most available standard is CD-006 (concrete, memorable, 39/40 score), it becomes the default anchor. Quantitative reports measure specific properties without needing a holistic quality target.

### C-2: "Crown Jewel" Is the Primary Linguistic Vector (CONFIRMED)

The phrase "crown jewel" appears in:
- MEMORY.md (auto-loaded)
- design-system/CLAUDE.md lines ~143, ~145, ~655 (auto-loaded)
- Reports 09, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 (in error)

It does NOT appear in:
- Reports 14, 15 (correct framing)
- Reports 21-26, 29 (post-correction)

The phrase functions as a shorthand that collapses the tier model into a binary (crown jewel vs everything else). Replacing it with "CEILING-tier reference artifact" introduces the tier model into every mention.

### C-3: Scoring-as-Fraction Is the Most Dangerous Pattern (CONFIRMED)

Reports 09 and 11 are the only CRITICAL reports, and both use scoring-as-fraction:
- Report 09: pages scored as 60%, 75% of CD-006
- Report 11: pages scored as fractions of 39/40

This pattern is more dangerous than label contamination because it QUANTIFIES the relationship, making CD-006 = 100% an implicit mathematical axiom rather than just a vocabulary choice.

### C-4: No Report's Core Findings Were Invalidated (CONFIRMED)

In every corrected report, the central analytical contribution survives the framing correction:
- Report 09: richness-as-vocabulary-fluency remains valid
- Report 11: 9 propositions about quality remain valid
- Report 17: 6-layer soul analysis remains valid
- Report 19: 7-test methodology and 7-0 verdict remain valid
- Reports 08, 13, 18: core findings entirely independent of CD-006

The framing errors affected CONTEXT and ASPIRATION, not METHODOLOGY. This is reassuring for the analytical corpus's integrity.

### C-5: Three Layers of Contamination (NEW)

This cross-validation identifies three distinct contamination layers, ordered from surface to structural:

1. **LINGUISTIC** — "Crown jewel" vocabulary in reports and auto-loaded files. PARTIALLY ADDRESSED by corrections and vocabulary replacement.

2. **OPERATIONAL** — Gate runner uses CD-006 as calibration standard. NOT ADDRESSED. Affects production, not just analysis.

3. **DEFINITIONAL** — Flagship 4/4 definition contains 2 tainted dimensions (D-04, D-13) reverse-engineered from CD-006 gaps. NOT ADDRESSED. Affects the target itself.

The first audit primarily addresses Layer 1. Layers 2 and 3 require different interventions.

---

## Part 6: Verdict

### On the First Audit

**VALIDATED.** The first audit (`20-cd006-framing-audit.md`) is accurate, complete within its scope (reports 01-19), and correctly identifies severity levels, contamination vectors, and cross-cutting patterns. Zero disagreements on any classification.

### On the Correction Process

**PARTIALLY EFFECTIVE.** The corrections successfully:
- Shifted vocabulary in 7 reports from "crown jewel" to "CEILING-tier reference artifact"
- Established the tier model as the universal quality reference
- Prevented contamination in all subsequent reports (21-26, 29)

The corrections did NOT address:
- Original contaminated text (preserved, still readable, still anchoring)
- MEMORY.md contamination (root of chain)
- design-system/CLAUDE.md contamination (second link)
- Gate runner operational contamination
- Flagship definition tainted dimensions (D-04, D-13)

### On Remaining Risk

The contamination chain through auto-loaded files (MEMORY.md → CLAUDE.md → gate-runner → case study) means every future agent in this project STILL inherits CD-006 framing before encountering any corrective context. The corrections to reports 09, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 help WITHIN those reports, but the systemic architecture continues to propagate the framing.

# Content Map: Steve Yegge and Gas Town

Content type: MIXED
Word count: ~5,273

## 1. Content Classification
- Type: MIXED (text paragraphs, tables, ASCII diagrams, code blocks, blockquotes, ordered/unordered lists, checklists, metadata headers across 13 major sections)
- Structural heterogeneity: HIGH — 11 of 13 sections contain 3+ distinct element types. Sections routinely combine prose paragraphs + tables + ASCII art diagrams + code blocks + blockquotes within a single heading. The "8 Roles Architecture" section alone uses: prose, ASCII hierarchy diagram, per-role sub-sections each with bullet lists + code blocks + model recommendations, and a communication flow ASCII diagram.
- Metaphor viability: HIGH — The content IS a metaphor. "Gas Town" is a Mad Max: Fury Road reference that structures the entire architecture: Mayor, Deacon, Dogs, Refinery, Polecat, Witness, Crew, Overseer. The factory/colony metaphor ("ant colony vs single ant") pervades every section. The content already thinks in spatial/hierarchical terms (Town Level vs Rig Level vs Human Level). The 8-stage evolution ladder and 6-wave timeline provide additional structural frames.

## 2. Mode Determination
COMPOSED — HIGH heterogeneity (11/13 sections at 3+ element types) combined with HIGH metaphor viability (the content IS a metaphor — factory/colony/town with named roles and spatial hierarchy). The content's own structural language (Town Level / Rig Level / Human Level, complexity ladder, wave timeline) provides rich material for CSS embodiment beyond surface application.

## 3. Zone Architecture
Recommended zones: 6 (content is ~5,273 words, fits 4,000-7,000 bracket)

| Zone | Name | Density | Content Sections | Pacing | Direction |
|------|------|---------|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| Z1 | Orientation & Context | LOW | You Are Here, TOC, D-FINAL metadata | Entry/grounding | Vertical descent through complexity ladder |
| Z2 | Who & Why | MODERATE | Section 1 (Who is Steve Yegge?), Section 2 (Gas Town Mental Model) | Widening — from person to philosophy | Horizontal comparison (traditional vs Gas Town) |
| Z3 | Architecture Core | HIGH | Section 3 (8 Roles Architecture), Section 4 (Beads Memory System) | Dense technical — the structural heart | Hierarchical (Town > Rig > Human), then layered (Hot > Warm > Cold) |
| Z4 | Philosophy & Principles | MODERATE | Section 5 (6 Waves of AI), Section 6 (Core Principles — GUPP, Zero Framework Cognition, Cattle Not Pets, etc.) | Reflective plateau — absorb after density peak | Temporal (waves) then conceptual (principles) |
| Z5 | Implementation & Operations | HIGH | Section 7 (Implementation Guide), Section 8 (Checkpoints), Section 9 (Troubleshooting), Section 10 (When to Use) | Practical acceleration — hands-on | Sequential (install > configure > run > fix > decide) |
| Z6 | Reference & Context | LOW-MODERATE | Section 11 (Quotes), Section 12 (Comparisons), Section 13 (Sources), Appendix, Cost Estimation | Release/reference — browsable, not sequential | Comparative (side-by-side tables) then bibliographic |

## 4. Content Tensions
1. **Control vs Chaos** — Pole A (Control): "Clear role hierarchy — Mayor, Deacon, Dogs, Workers" / Pole B (Chaos): "Some bugs fixed 2-3 times. Some fixes get lost. Focus: THROUGHPUT, not perfection." Pole B (Chaos) dominant — the entire philosophy accepts chaos as a feature, not a bug. The system is designed to survive failure, not prevent it.
2. **Individual Mastery vs Colony Scale** — Pole A (Individual): "Claude Code is the world's biggest fuckin' ant. Everyone is focused on making their ant run longer" / Pole B (Colony): "when nature prefers colonies." Pole B (Colony) dominant — this is the thesis statement. But the tension persists: you must be Stage 7+ (individual mastery) before you can operate at colony scale.
3. **Accessibility vs Elitism** — Pole A (Accessible): The document is structured as a tutorial with checkpoints, checklists, and troubleshooting / Pole B (Elite): "If you're not at Stage 7, you'll get your face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees." Pole B (Elite) dominant — the content repeatedly gates itself behind experience thresholds, budget requirements, and chaos tolerance. The tutorial form is in tension with the "this isn't for you" messaging.
4. **Human Authority vs AI Autonomy** — Pole A (Human): "You're the PM" / "Has inbox, sends/receives mail" / Pole B (AI): "Claude makes all decisions. The orchestrator executes." / "100% vibe-coded — I have never looked at the code myself." Neither pole dominant — this is the productive tension. The human is PM (strategic authority) but never reads the code (operational surrender).

Metaphor-shaping tension: #1 (Control vs Chaos). The Mad Max reference, the factory metaphor, the role hierarchy — all exist to impose just enough structure on inherent chaos. This tension is what makes Gas Town Gas Town: not a clean corporate org chart, but a post-apocalyptic settlement that works despite (because of?) its roughness.

## 5. Metaphor Seeds
1. **The Settlement / Outpost** — Directly from the Mad Max: Fury Road source material. A fortified compound in hostile territory, with roles (Mayor, Dogs, Crew), infrastructure (Refinery, Witness), and a survival economy. CSS directions: rough/industrial textures for borders and backgrounds, hierarchical spatial organization (town level = top band, rig level = middle, human level = bottom), role-based color coding, a sense of functional fortification rather than polish. Risk: LOW (the content already IS this metaphor; embodying it is alignment, not imposition).
2. **The Ant Colony / Factory Floor** — From the core "ant colony vs single ant" thesis. A living system with specialized workers, communication channels, and emergent order from simple rules. CSS directions: cell/hexagonal layouts for role grids, worker-flow animations, swarm density in the architecture zone, sparse edges for the human/overseer zone. Risk: MEDIUM (competes with the Mad Max frame; mixing biological colony + industrial factory could muddy the visual language).
3. **The Complexity Ladder / Evolution Scale** — From the 8-stage dev evolution and 6-wave AI timeline. Ascent through levels of capability, with Gas Town at the summit. CSS directions: vertical progression, stage markers, elevation metaphor (ground level = basic, summit = Gas Town), thinning atmosphere (increasing abstraction with height). Risk: MEDIUM (works for orientation sections but doesn't sustain across the full document; better as a local device within Z1/Z4 than a page-spanning metaphor).

Recommendation: Seed #1 (The Settlement / Outpost). The content was named after Gas Town for a reason — the Mad Max frame is not decorative, it is structural. Every role name, every principle (survival-focused, chaos-tolerant, throughput over perfection), every quote reinforces this metaphor. Embodying it in CSS means the visual language and the content language are the same thing, which is the definition of structural metaphor.

## 6. Density Arc
Z1 [LOW] -> Z2 [MODERATE] -> Z3 [HIGH - PEAK] -> Z4 [MODERATE] -> Z5 [HIGH] -> Z6 [LOW-MODERATE]
Section heights (estimated): Z1: 350px / Z2: 700px / Z3: 1400px / Z4: 650px / Z5: 1200px / Z6: 800px. Pattern: DOUBLE-PEAK (architecture peak at Z3, implementation peak at Z5, with philosophical valley at Z4 between them).

The density arc has two distinct peaks rather than a single climax:
- Z3 is the conceptual peak (8 roles + Beads = the hardest ideas to absorb)
- Z5 is the operational peak (installation + troubleshooting = the most action-dense)
- Z4 sits between them as a breathing space (philosophy, principles, waves = reflective content that lets the reader consolidate before the second climb)

This double-peak pattern is characteristic of technical documentation that must teach BOTH architecture AND operations.

## 7. Reader Profile
- Who: Advanced AI-assisted developer (Stage 7+ on Yegge's scale), already running 10+ parallel Claude Code instances, comfortable with tmux and CLI workflows, has spent $1,000+ on API costs, seeks the next level of orchestration scale. Likely a solo developer or small-team lead who wants "team-scale output" without a team.
- Axis positions:
  - Axis 1 (Info Density): Expert-leaning — line-height 1.55, font-size 16px. These readers consume dense technical docs daily and will bounce if the page feels padded.
  - Axis 2 (Visual Complexity): Moderate-Expert — 3 components/viewport. The content's own ASCII diagrams already pack 3-4 elements per visual. Readers expect information-rich views.
  - Axis 3 (Progressive Disclosure): Moderate — selective collapsibility. Role deep-dives and troubleshooting sections benefit from collapse (8 roles = scannable headers with expand-on-demand). But the architecture diagrams and principles should be always-visible.
  - Axis 4 (Navigation Complexity): Moderate — TOC + section anchors. The existing 13-section TOC is already present in the content. A sticky/floating nav helps because the document is long (~5,200 words), but a full-page map would be over-engineering.
  - Axis 5 (Entry Velocity): Moderate-Fast — the "You Are Here" section provides quick orientation but doesn't linger. These readers want to know "am I in the right place?" within 5 seconds, then dive in.
- What they expect: A clear, scannable technical reference with enough depth to actually implement Gas Town — tables for quick lookup, code blocks they can copy, and diagrams they can study. No fluff.
- What should surprise them: The visual language should embody the Mad Max settlement metaphor at a structural level — not through imagery or illustration, but through the CSS itself feeling fortified, functional, and slightly rough. The page should feel like it was built in Gas Town, not about Gas Town.

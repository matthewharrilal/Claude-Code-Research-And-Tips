# MASTER EXECUTION PROMPT ASSEMBLY -- Structural Outline for Audit

> This file captures the KEY STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS of the prompt being audited.
> Auditors: use this to understand WHAT the prompt covers, then audit SOURCE FILES to find GAPS.

## PROMPT SECTIONS

### 1. PREAMBLE (Urgency + Metacognitive Architecture)
- Weight statement: everything converges into this artifact, 22 agents × 5 passes × ~320 min
- Ceiling failure lesson: 1,004 lines → 9/9 novelty, 8/8 soul, 70-80% void, DO NOT SHIP
- Middle success lesson: shorter prompt → better compliance → PA-05 4/4 DESIGNED
- 4 simultaneous functions in TENSION: inspire, constrain, coordinate, reference
- Metacognitive questions for every line written

### 2. READING LIST (66+ files across 6 layers)
- Layer A: 24 pre-flight files (master checklist, gap analysis, crossref, E1-E4, S1-S4, V1-V3, states, extractions)
- Layer B: 21 flagship preparation files (01-21)
- Layer C: 6 enriched design system files (prohibitions, mechanism-catalog, tokens, semantic-rules, TC skill, PA skill)
- Layer D: 2 crown jewels (CD-006 + DD-006)
- Layer E: 12 experiment research files (6 scale exploration + 6 flagship prep)
- Layer F: Ceiling + middle experiment artifacts

### 3. LAYER 1: CONVICTION (~70 lines)
**Specified content:**
- Thesis: "difference between Flagship and Ceiling is not complexity — it is restraint"
- Beauty definition: "confident intention at every scale of attention"
- Three-word personality: "Warm. Authoritative. Unhurried."
- 4 resolved tensions: warm/not-soft, austere/not-cold, authoritative/not-aggressive, restrained/not-empty
- Quality exemplars: 20 lines CD-006 (designed transition zone) + 20 lines DD-006 (fractal coherence)
- Constraint pressure principle
- Anti-scale model: Richness = semantic density × restraint × spatial confidence
- Experiential truth about spatial calculation
- Smoking gun: 2 scales PA-05 4/4 vs 4 scales PA-05 1.5/4
- Iteration insight: CD-006 39/40 via iteration + messaging vs ceiling DO NOT SHIP via single-pass

**Prompt asks assembler to think holistically:** What ELSE should be in conviction?

### 4. LAYER 2: EXECUTION SPEC (~100-120 lines)
**Structure by concern:**
- 2A SPATIAL (~15 lines): container 940-960px, CPL 45-80, content-to-void ≥60:40, max void threshold, empty elements, heading spacing, max spacing 96px, header proportion, footer, content distribution
- 2B SOUL (~10 lines): 8/8 soul compliance (list of 8), warm palette, typography trinity
- 2C COMPOSITIONAL (~15 lines): per-category minimums, reinforcing pairs, 3-transition minimum, designed moment per quartile, purpose-built components, mechanism cap 16/12-14, density cap per viewport, distribution, signal-to-silence
- 2D PROCESS (~15 lines): Phase 0E library prohibition, two-instance pattern, checkpoints A+B, builder self-scroll, embedded auditor acknowledgment
- 2E BUILDER SELF-CHECK (~15 lines): container width, CPL, content-to-void, token compliance, soul 8/8, header+footer, sections, rhythm, designed moment, transition grammar, spatial budget

**Each rule tested:** binary?, verification method?, attention cost?, contradictions?, standalone utility?

### 5. LAYER 3: COORDINATION SPEC (~60 lines)
- 3A AGENT ROSTER (~25 lines): team lead (Opus), metaphor (Opus), content architect (Opus), planner (Opus), skeleton A+B (Sonnet), embedded auditor (Sonnet), mechanism builder (Sonnet), metaphor builder (Opus), intentionality builder (Opus), crown jewel analyst (Opus), 9× PA auditors (Sonnet)
- 3B COMMUNICATION (~20 lines): 5 mandatory checkpoints (A-E), min 8 messages, zero-message check at Pass 1, information-bearing requirement
- 3C AUDIT PROTOCOL (~15 lines): gate sequence 0-5, screenshot pre-capture, 9 auditors, dual PA, blind novelty, comparative vs Middle, metacognitive reviewer

### 6. LAYER 4: REFERENCE LIBRARY (zero prompt cost)
- 7 files with per-agent routing

### 7. TEAM TOPOLOGY (for prompt ASSEMBLY, not for flagship experiment)
- Phase 1 (8 parallel): conviction-researcher, execution-researcher, coordination-researcher, reference-researcher + 3 independent auditors + cross-reference-checker
- Phase 2 (3 sequential): conviction-comparator, execution-comparator, coordination-comparator
- Phase 3 (4 sequential): 3 layer assemblers + 1 integrator
- Phase 4 (5 parallel): line-count, binary-rule, attention-cost, contradiction, adversarial validators
- Phase 5 (2 sequential): fix-agent + veto-agent

### 8. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES (10 total)
1. Prompt = machine, not document
2. Binary rules = 100% compliance, judgment = ~0%
3. Information loss = routing problem
4. Preparation paradox: more rules = worse output
5. Spatial confidence = THE gate with veto
6. Constraint pressure = engine of quality
7. Think holistically at every step
8. Nothing done until adversarially validated
9. Goal = beautiful page, not perfect prompt
10. "STOP ANALYZING. START BUILDING."

### 9. SUCCESS CRITERIA (17 items)
- Layer 1: ~70 lines, theories + examples, zero rules
- Layer 2: ~100-120 lines, pure binary, zero judgment
- Layer 3: ~60 lines, roles + gates + communication
- Layer 4: file list with routing
- Total ≤240 lines
- Builder ≤55 lines at ≤37 attention units
- Zero should/consider/may/aim/try/ensure in execution spec
- All 21 convergent items have homes
- All resolved thresholds correct
- All 7 BLOCKING enrichments referenced
- No contradictions within or across layers
- "10 Things" test passes
- Adversarial reviewer: no path to 70% void
- Attention cost documented per section
- Veto agent returns GO
- Level 2 observations documented
- Cross-reference: zero items lost from 187 unique items

## KNOWN GAPS IN CURRENT PROMPT (from user + pre-flight execution)
1. Tension-composition skill invocation may be insufficient — needs deeper, more exhaustive incorporation
2. Perceptual-auditing skill invocation may be insufficient — especially PA enrichments from ceiling reflections
3. Ceiling experiment reflections/retrospectives may not be fully captured
4. D-004 decision log findings (10 critical supplementary items) must inform the prompt
5. Pre-flight execution LIVING-STATE reveals Level 2 worker observations not yet integrated
6. CD-006 container was 1100px not 960px — container width rule may need adjustment
7. Mechanism cap debate: 16 vs 14 (S4 recommends 14)
8. Void threshold discrepancy: 2160px vs 1620px vs 1350px
9. Gate fatigue risk: 47 evaluation points = ~235 min overhead
10. Prompt structure suggestion from V2: conviction-execution-conviction sandwich

## PART 2: IMPLICIT AGREEMENTS (Same Conclusion Reached Independently)

### Agreement A1: Sub-perceptual CSS is the primary failure mode
**Conclusion:** 23.7% (233 lines) of flagship CSS was imperceptible to humans, constituting the root cause of the DO NOT SHIP verdict.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited | Confidence Boost |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 02 | "RC-4: Sub-perceptual variation satisfies every rule" -- 11/42 failures (26%) | F-09, F-10, F-11, F-12, F-14, F-15, F-16, F-17, F-21, F-22, F-32 | Deepest causal analysis |
| 05 | "23.7% of CSS invisible to human eye" -- central thesis of Shift 1 | CSS audit: 233/983 lines below perception threshold | Quantified the magnitude |
| 08 | "COMPLETE ABSENCE documented: zero occurrences of 'perception', 'threshold', 'human', 'RGB'" | Line-by-line search of master prompt | Proved absence was total |
| 10 | "Deployed vs Perceptible Is the Central Distinction" | 5/7 channels deployed but only 3/7 perceptible | Channel-level confirmation |
| 11 | P1: "Perception Over Compliance" as first and most-traced philosophy | 11 CSS changes traced to perception principle | Full bidirectional trace |
| 13 | "The Perception Gap" -- independently discovered without prior context | Fresh-eyes assessment of both prompts | Independent validation |
| 20 | "Perception thresholds are necessary for CSS quality" -- rated STRONGLY SUPPORTED | 9/9 PA auditors + 7/8 retrospective reports | Adversarial endorsement |
| 23 | U-06 compliance: no pure black/white = "sub-perceptual identity enforcement" | Grep confirms 0 instances of #000/#FFF but delta is 26 RGB -- borderline | Propagation trace confirms |
| 27 | Phase 0 deallocation: "removed CSS was genuinely sub-perceptual" | Builder confirmed CHECKPOINT passed -- page looks identical after 216-line deletion | Execution confirmation |
| 29 | Phase 0 is entirely NEW -- "No Master counterpart" for deallocation concept | Forward map: 0/97 Master rules address sub-perceptual cleanup | Structural absence proved |

**Convergence score: 10/25 files -- HIGHEST convergence of any finding**

### Agreement A2: Recipe format outperforms constraint format for builder agents
**Conclusion:** Sequential step-by-step instructions with specific CSS values produce more reliable output than scattered rules requiring agent judgment.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 02 | F-22: "B10 Self-Check -- CHECKLIST NOT RECIPE" (BLOCKING) | Builder checked boxes without acting |
| 05 | Shift 4: "From Constraint Language to Recipe Language" | 6-row linguistic register comparison |
| 07 | "Recipe replaces checklist" in topology shift | Operational comparison |
| 13 | "Constitution vs Recipe" -- independently discovered core framing | Zero-context analysis |
| 18 | Constraint:action ratio 3.0:1 (master) vs 0.32:1 (remediation) | Verb taxonomy with counts |
| 21 | "5.3x inversion" in judgment-to-action ratio | Full verb inventory: 233 vs 112 verbs |
| 22 | "Declarative-constitutional vs Phase-sequential recipe" | Structural decomposition |
| 24 | "Specification vs Procedure" -- two paradigms for LLM guidance | Theory-of-mind analysis |

**IMPORTANT CAVEAT** from files 20, 25, 26:
The recipe-vs-checklist framing is **OVERSTATED**. The real distinction is **concrete-vs-abstract**, not recipe-vs-checklist. A concrete checklist would outperform a vague recipe. The format (sequential vs scattered) is the vehicle, not the cargo. See Contradiction C2 below.

**Convergence score: 8/25 files agree on the thesis; 3/25 files challenge it as overstated = net 8 with caveat**

### Agreement A3: S-09 stacking loophole -- per-property caps allow total gaps exceeding limits
**Conclusion:** The master prompt's S-09 capped individual CSS properties at 96px, but the SUM of multiple properties at section boundaries created 210-276px gaps.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 02 | F-03: "S-09 STACKING LOOPHOLE" -- BLOCKING severity | Per-property vs total gap analysis |
| 04 | Extension 6: full stacking arithmetic with proof | 32+24+4+24+24 = 108 < 120px |
| 08 | Section 5: 11 transitions measured, ALL failed (1.8-2.9x over 96px) | Quantitative measurement of every transition |
| 10 | Section 3: stacking analysis with fix mechanism | Independent quantitative confirmation |
| 11 | P2: Spatial Confidence -- traces stacking fix to philosophy | Bidirectional trace |
| 13 | "Void Problem" -- independently identified | Fresh-eyes assessment |
| 23 | Divider margin reduction traced as "most impactful single fix" | Phase 3.2 propagation trace |
| 27 | Change 2 traced FULL chain from HTML 16px margin back to S-09 prompt failure | Complete backward trace |

**Convergence score: 8/25 files -- HIGH convergence, UNANIMOUSLY agreed**

### Agreement A4: Component library was invisible to the builder
**Conclusion:** The flagship builder used 3/26 component families because the master prompt's visibility cap prevented library exposure.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 02 | F-11: "ZERO COMPONENT LIBRARY REFERENCE" -- BLOCKING | Builder created 15 custom classes |
| 04 | Extension 3: from "Purpose-Built" to typed callout family | 4-variant callout conversion |
| 06 | "Library as Ambient Reference vs Execution Target" | 3/26 -> 10/26 families traced |
| 11 | P6: "Component Library as Design Vocabulary" | Full philosophy trace |
| 27 | Change 3 (callout family) traced FULL chain back to RC-9 | Builder visibility cap as root cause |
| 29 | C-10 -> Phase 1.5: REVERSED relationship (Master: invent new; Remediation: adopt standard) | Line-by-line contradiction |

**Convergence score: 6/25 files -- MODERATE-HIGH convergence**

### Agreement A5: Binary rules achieve 100% compliance; judgment rules achieve ~0%
**Conclusion:** Rules with measurable binary outcomes (container 940-1100px) are followed perfectly; rules requiring qualitative judgment (CCS >= 0.30, "spatial confidence") are satisfied at surface level only.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 02 | "Failure Pattern 4: Judgment Rules Achieve ~0% Compliance" | 7 TYPE 5 failures |
| 05 | "The Paradox of Zero Judgment Language" | CSS philosophy shift analysis |
| 08 | Paradigm 1: binary compliance vs judgment | Perception model framing |
| 10 | MC rules as "judgment rules in disguise" | CCS never computed despite MC-01 mandate |
| 21 | Propagation ranking: CONCRETE DELETE ~98% vs COUNTERFACTUAL THOUGHT ~5% | 10-rank reliability table |
| 23 | S-01 (binary, 940-1100px) = FULL propagation; MG-04 (judgment, structural metaphor) = ZERO propagation | 15-rule propagation trace |

**Convergence score: 6/25 files -- MODERATE-HIGH convergence, UNANIMOUSLY agreed**

### Agreement A6: Accessibility was a complete blind spot in the master prompt
**Conclusion:** The master prompt contained zero accessibility rules. The remediation added 7 features (skip link, main wrapper, ARIA labels, roles, focus states, reduced motion, print styles).

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 02 | F-13: "ZERO ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS" | Master prompt audit |
| 04 | Extension 7: "From Zero Seed to Full WCAG 2.1 AA" | 0/8 -> 7/8 features |
| 06 | "Semantic Markup: Addition or Reversal?" | Accessibility + HTML analysis |
| 13 | Section 7F: "Semantic HTML Depth" -- notes even remediation is incomplete | Independent gap finding |
| 27 | Change 6 chain: PARTIAL -- retro never identified; emerged in audit | Backward trace breaks at retro->prompt |
| 29 | Phase 7 = entirely NEW: "No Master rule" for skip links, focus states, responsive, print | Line-by-line mapping |

**Convergence score: 6/25 files -- MODERATE-HIGH convergence**

### Agreement A7: The remediation spec had internal contradictions the builder silently fixed
**Conclusion:** The remediation spec prescribed cool-gray values (#FAFAFA, #F5F8FA) that violated soul constraint U-08 ("no cool-toned grays"). The builder independently warm-shifted them.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 04 | Extension 1: builder overrides noted as "judgment" | B-01, B-02, B-03 fixes |
| 11 | P3 (Warm Identity) overrode spec literal values -- 6 philosophy-philosophy tensions | Builder deviation analysis |
| 23 | Phase 2: "Builder did it? YES with modifications... B-01 fix" | Propagation trace |
| 25 | Extension 1: "The report frames a spec mistake as a sign of the spec's success. That's spin." | Bias challenge |
| 27 | Change 1: PARTIAL (spec prescribed value violating own constraint); Change 10: BROKEN (internal contradiction) | Backward trace |

**Convergence score: 5/25 files -- MODERATE convergence**

### Agreement A8: The master prompt's approach can produce excellent results (CD-006 39/40)
**Conclusion:** The constitutional/specification approach is not fundamentally broken -- it produced CD-006 at 39/40 with the right builder.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 01 | CD-006 referenced as quality exemplar | Foundation tracing |
| 05 | "Ambient richness works when builders have COMPOSITIONAL FLUENCY" | CSS philosophy analysis |
| 20 | Steel-man Section 6: "CD-006 scored 39/40 using the master prompt's approach" | Strongest adversarial argument |
| 24 | "Generation can reach 39/40 OR 1.5/4" -- high ceiling, low floor | Fundamental differences analysis |
| 25 | "CD-006 is an unexamined benchmark" -- production conditions not analyzed | Cross-report Finding 3 |

**Convergence score: 5/25 files -- MODERATE convergence; 25 challenges that CD-006 conditions are unexamined**

### Agreement A9: Zone-based architecture is the organizing principle of both prompts
**Conclusion:** The 3-zone warm/cool/resolved arc is preserved across master prompt and remediation.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 01 | Zone architecture rated 3rd most impactful foundation | Foundation trace |
| 04 | Extensions 1, 5, 10 organized around zone groups | Extension analysis |
| 08 | Zone boundaries as perception measurement points | Threshold analysis |
| 10 | Zone transitions as coherence verification targets | Cascade table design |
| 11 | P5: Typography as zone-based semantic signal | Philosophy trace |
| 13 | "Zone-Based Architecture" -- preserved well | Independent confirmation |
| 29 | Phase 2 zone backgrounds: 12 values organized in 3 groups | Line-by-line mapping |

**Convergence score: 7/25 files -- HIGH convergence**

### Agreement A10: 71% of the master prompt's rules were dropped by the remediation
**Conclusion:** Only 28/97 rules were preserved/refined/extended; 69 were dropped entirely.

| File | How They Frame It | Evidence Cited |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 07 | From 97 rules to ~45 steps -- massive simplification | Topology shift analysis |
| 22 | Master has 97 rules across 12 sections; Remediation has 9 phases | Structural comparison |
| 29 | Aggregate: 37 PRESERVED + 30 REFINED + 23 EXTENDED + 52 NEW + 16 REVERSED + 103 DROPPED | Full line-by-line count |

**Most specific quantification from file 29:**
- S-rules: 12/17 dropped (71%)
- C-rules: 17/21 dropped (81%)
- MG-rules: 5/5 dropped (100%)
- CT-rules: 7/8 dropped (100%, 1 reversed)
- RP-rules: 4/4 dropped (100%)
- CP-rules: 6/6 dropped (100%)
- U-rules: 1/10 dropped (10%) -- BEST preservation rate

**Convergence score: 3/25 files -- LOW convergence (only 3 address this directly), but 29's data is definitive**

## PART 3: DIRECT CONTRADICTIONS

### Contradiction C1: Recipe-vs-checklist -- real distinction or overstated?

**Position A: Recipe-vs-checklist IS the core finding**
- File 00: "the core metacognitive finding" (line 78)
- File 02: F-22 rates checklist format as BLOCKING
- File 05: "From Constraint Language to Recipe Language" (Shift 4)
- File 13: "Constitution vs Recipe" as independently discovered core framing
- File 18: 3.0:1 vs 0.32:1 constraint:action ratio

**Position B: The real distinction is concrete-vs-abstract, not recipe-vs-checklist**
- File 20: "OVERSTATED. The real thesis should be: 'Concrete perceptual specifications outperform abstract structural specifications'" (line 110)
- File 25: "Could be confounded with specificity, context advantage, builder quality, or iteration effects" (Report 02 challenge)
- File 26: "The analyst picks the judgment-to-action ratio because it's the ratio they MEASURED, not because they've TESTED it against alternatives" (Report 21 challenge)

**Resolution recommendation:** Adopt file 20's refined framing. "Concrete-vs-abstract" subsumes "recipe-vs-checklist" -- a concrete checklist would work; a vague recipe would fail. The format correlates with specificity but is not the causal variable.

### Contradiction C2: Channel taxonomy -- which 7 channels?

**Position A: Master prompt's channels**
- Files 01, 02, 08, 23: Ch1 Chromatic, Ch2 Typographic, Ch3 Spatial, Ch4 Structural, Ch5 Density, Ch6 Rhythmic, Ch7 Intentional

**Position B: Remediation's channels**
- Files 10, 29: Ch1 Typographic, Ch2 Chromatic, Ch3 Spatial, Ch4 Structural, Ch5 Temporal, Ch6 Behavioral, Ch7 Material
- 3 channels REPLACED: Density->absorbed, Rhythmic->Behavioral, Intentional->Material

**Resolution recommendation:** Adopt remediation taxonomy (file 10's recommendation). The replaced channels (Behavioral, Material) are more measurable than the originals (Rhythmic, Intentional). Flag in any future prompt that the channel numbering shifted.

### Contradiction C3: Gap threshold -- 96px or 120px?

**Position A: Master prompt S-09 = 96px per-property, total gap <= 96px**
- Files 02, 08: S-09 at 96px

**Position B: Remediation = 120px total gap**
- Files 04, 27, 29: Phase 3.2 + Phase 8B use 120px threshold

**Resolution recommendation:** The remediation's 120px is operationally tested and accounts for stacking. The master's 96px was per-property (not total) and failed. Adopt 120px total-gap as the operational threshold. Note that 29 explicitly marks this as "REFINED" (Remediation is LOOSER by 25%).

### Contradiction C4: Did the remediation "succeed"?

**Position A: Yes, significant improvement**
- File 00: PA-05 improved from 1.5/4 to 2.5/4
- Files 04, 05, 23: Improvements traced and quantified

**Position B: No, PA-05 2.5/4 is below the 3/4 shipping threshold**
- File 20: "PA-05 = 2.5/4 is below the 3/4 shipping threshold. The remediation IMPROVED the page but did not produce a shippable result. Calling this 'success' is lowering the bar." (line 274)
- File 26: "Actual remediation results (2.5/4) fell below analysts' predictions (3/4)" (Finding 3)

**Resolution recommendation:** Use precise language. The remediation IMPROVED the page (1.5 -> 2.5, +1.0 points). It did NOT achieve the shipping threshold (3/4). "Success" should be qualified as "improvement" not "achievement."

### Contradiction C5: Component philosophy -- invent bespoke or adopt standard?

**Position A: Master prompt C-10 = invent purpose-built components**
- File 02: C-10 wants "2+ purpose-built components invented for THIS content"

**Position B: Remediation = adopt standard library classes**
- File 06: Convert .component-block to .callout family (standard library)
- File 29: C-10 marked as REVERSED

**Resolution recommendation:** Both have merit in context. For FROM-SCRATCH builds, purpose-built components serve content-form alignment. For REMEDIATION, adopting standard library classes serves consistency and maintainability. This is a paradigm-appropriate difference, not an error in either document.

### Contradiction C6: Content transformation -- rewrite or preserve?

**Position A: Master prompt CT-01 = rewrite every sentence, no direct copying**
- File 29: CT-01 through CT-08 mandate content rewriting

**Position B: Remediation = "Do NOT change text content"**
- File 29: CT-01 marked REVERSED -- "DIRECT CONTRADICTION"

**Resolution recommendation:** This is architecturally intentional. Content was already transformed by the original multi-pass build. The remediation correctly preserves already-transformed content. For first-pass builds, CT-01 applies; for remediation, content preservation applies. Not a true contradiction -- different phases of the same pipeline.

### Contradiction C7: Does conviction language help or hurt?

**Position A: Conviction helps creative agents (Opus planners/metaphor agents)**
- File 22: "Conviction helps PLANNING agents who must make novel decisions"
- File 24: "The hidden advantage of declarative: allows LLMs to use their STRONGEST capability -- pattern completion"

**Position B: Conviction wastes tokens and biases without calibrating**
- File 18: "Motivational language wastes tokens" -- Master's conviction layer cited
- File 21: "Conviction language as directional bias... 'Unhurried' produced excessive whitespace"
- File 22: "107 lines of philosophy means 107 lines LESS of specification"

**Resolution recommendation:** File 22's synthesis is correct: conviction helps PLANNING agents (Opus) but hurts EXECUTION agents (Sonnet builders). The master prompt treats all agents as planners. Future prompts should route conviction ONLY to creative agents, never to builders.

### Contradiction C8: Single-agent vs multi-agent for novel builds

**Position A: Single-agent with recipe is generally better**
- File 05: Implies recipe + single-agent is universally better
- File 07: Remediation topology celebrated

**Position B: Multi-agent is necessary for novel builds**
- File 07: "Master prompt topology appropriate for NOVEL builds"
- File 24: "No single agent can hold 964 lines, exercise aesthetic judgment, AND write coherent CSS. But a system of 12+ specialized agents, gated and coordinated, CAN approximate this composite capability."
- File 22: 4-layer architecture requires role separation

**Resolution recommendation:** Context-dependent. Single-agent for remediation/brownfield. Multi-agent for novel/greenfield. The distinction is TASK TYPE, not agent architecture preference.

## PART 6: FILE-TO-FILE RELATIONSHIP MAP

### Strongest File Pairs (most cross-references and agreement)

| File A | File B | Relationship | Agreements | Tensions |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| 02 (failures) | 04 (building) | COMPLEMENTARY: 42 failures -> 12 remediation extensions | All 12 extensions map to specific failures | None |
| 02 (failures) | 08 (perception) | REINFORCING: Both identify RC-4 as primary cause | Sub-perceptual analysis from different angles | 02 focuses on prompt failures; 08 on perception model |
| 05 (css-philosophy) | 08 (perception) | REINFORCING: Both identify perception shift as central | "Compliance to perception" from different lenses | 05 has 5 shifts; 08 argues they're facets of 1 shift |
| 11 (bidirectional) | 23 (propagation) | COMPLEMENTARY: 11 maps philosophy->action; 23 maps instruction->visible output | Zone backgrounds, borders, typography traced by both | 11 traces philosophies; 23 traces specific CSS propagation |
| 20 (adversarial) | 25 (bias-core) | REINFORCING: Both challenge the analysis's own biases | N=2, CD-006 unexamined, recipe thesis overstated | 20 is the adversary; 25 applies adversarial lens to individual reports |
| 21 (verbiage) | 22 (structure) | COMPLEMENTARY: 21 analyzes language; 22 analyzes architecture | Both conclude remediation structure is more reliable | Different analytical lenses, same conclusion |
| 27 (reproducibility) | 29 (line-crossref) | COMPLEMENTARY: 27 tests backward chain; 29 maps forward/reverse | Both identify spec contradictions (cool grays in soul-constrained spec) | 27 focuses on builder judgment; 29 on structural mapping |
| 25 (bias-core) | 26 (bias-dim) | COMPLEMENTARY: 25 challenges files 01-13; 26 challenges files 17-24 | Both identify echo chamber risk, N=2 limitation, hindsight packaging | Different report sets, same bias patterns |

### File Clusters (groups of files that address the same domain)

**Cluster 1: CSS/Perception Analysis** (files 05, 08, 10, 23)
- Central finding: Sub-perceptual CSS is the primary failure; perception thresholds are the fix
- Internal consistency: 100% (all agree)

**Cluster 2: Prompt Architecture Analysis** (files 18, 21, 22, 24)
- Central finding: Recipe/concrete/procedural format outperforms constraint/abstract/declarative
- Internal consistency: 95% (24 overgeneralizes; 26 challenges 24's claims)

**Cluster 3: Process/Execution Analysis** (files 07, 27, 28, 29)
- Central finding: Single-agent with full context outperforms multi-agent with information loss (for remediation)
- Internal consistency: 90% (07 notes multi-agent is needed for novel builds)

**Cluster 4: Adversarial/Meta Analysis** (files 13, 20, 25, 26)
- Central finding: The narrative is coherent but rests on N=2, uncontrolled confounds, and hindsight packaging
- Internal consistency: 85% (13 is less adversarial than 20/25/26)

**Cluster 5: Foundation/Extension Tracing** (files 01, 02, 04, 11)
- Central finding: 89% of foundations preserved; 12 extensions built on master prompt seeds; 11 philosophies trace bidirectionally
- Internal consistency: 80% (01 is more summarization; 11 is deeper analysis; 25 challenges 01)

## PART 7: META-FINDINGS FROM CROSS-REFERENCING

### Meta-Finding 1: Three Independent Variables Are Being Conflated

Across all 25 files, three separate insights appear under the single banner of "the remediation approach":

1. **FORMAT:** Sequential recipe vs scattered checklist (files 02, 05, 07, 13, 18, 22)
2. **SPECIFICITY:** Concrete hex values vs abstract criteria like CCS >= 0.30 (files 20, 21, 23, 24)
3. **PERCEPTION:** Human-visible minimum deltas as binary gates (files 02, 05, 08, 10, 17)

Files 20, 25, and 26 correctly identify this conflation. A concrete checklist with perception thresholds would likely outperform a vague recipe. The recipe format is correlated with but not causally responsible for the improvement.

### Meta-Finding 2: Zero Cross-Agent Disagreements on 10 Major Findings

File 28 (reproducibility-consistency) documents that across 71 agent-finding pairs, there are ZERO disagreements on the 10 major findings. This is either remarkable consistency or a groupthink signal. File 28 argues it's genuine convergence because:
- File 13 (fresh-eyes, zero context) independently reached the same conclusions
- Findings trace to specific line numbers in source documents
- Disagreements exist precisely where source documents are ambiguous

### Meta-Finding 3: The Cheapest Most Informative Experiment Has Not Been Run

File 20 identifies 4 experiments that would resolve the central ambiguities:
1. Add perception thresholds to master prompt and re-run (isolates threshold variable)
2. Explain why CD-006 succeeded and flagship didn't (isolates builder/context variable)
3. Test whether remediation spec is reusable with different content (isolates content variable)
4. Give builder ONLY the threshold table and nothing else (isolates threshold from recipe)

No other file proposes these experiments. File 26 endorses them as "most valuable contribution of any report." The narrative has settled before the critical experiment was conducted.

### Meta-Finding 4: Intentionality Is the Unanalyzed Layer

File 27 (reproducibility-test) identifies that NONE of the 11 core analysis reports examines the intentionality layer -- the 6 dimensions (self-reference, pedagogical sequencing, cognitive transitions, bookending, meta-annotation, metaphor encoding) that separate COMPETENT (3/4) from DESIGNED (4/4). This is the biggest analytical blind spot across the entire corpus.

### Meta-Finding 5: Analysts Found What Their Framing Expected

File 25's cross-report Finding 5: "The master-failures analyst found 42 failures. The bidirectional-mapper found zero orphans. The foundations analyst found 89% preservation. The fresh-eyes reviewer found the remediation more actionable." Every analyst's findings align with their framing question. This is evidence that framing determines findings, not that the findings are wrong -- but it means the analysis validates the team-lead's thesis because the framing questions were designed to test that thesis.

### Meta-Finding 6: Actual Results (2.5/4) Fell Below Predictions (3/4)

Files 21, 22, and 24 predicted PA-05 3/4 based on remediation instruction clarity. The actual result was 2.5/4 (file 00). File 26 identifies this as a calibration failure: "the dimensional analysts are OVERCONFIDENT in their predictions." The recipe-format theory predicted higher reliability than was achieved, suggesting an unmodeled variable (likely content register monotony RC-13, or intentionality gap per file 27).

### Meta-Finding 7: Four Genuinely Novel Contributions vs Applied Existing Knowledge

File 26 separates genuine discoveries from well-known principles repackaged:

**Genuinely novel:**
1. Perception threshold encoding as binary gates (files 02, 08, 17, 21)
2. Stacking arithmetic for void prevention (files 02, 04, 08, 17)
3. Propagation reliability ranking by instruction pattern (file 21)
4. Deallocation-before-addition principle applied to CSS (files 04, 05, 17)

**Applied existing knowledge (presented as discoveries):**
- Separation of concerns (file 22) = standard software architecture
- Declarative vs imperative (file 24) = fundamental CS distinction
- Scientific method (file 19) = literally the scientific method
- Audience-appropriate communication (file 18) = basic technical writing

## PART 9: UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

Questions raised by the cross-referencing that no file fully answers:

1. **Would the master prompt + perception thresholds (4 lines) have produced an equivalent result?** (Raised by file 20, endorsed by file 26, unanswered by all.)

2. **Why did CD-006 succeed with the same constitutional approach that the flagship failed?** (Raised by file 20, partially addressed by file 05 as "compositional fluency," but CD-006's production conditions are unexamined per file 25.)

3. **What would happen with different content?** File 27 estimates 71% of the page is content-dependent. File 09 estimates 46% agnostic at execution level. These are different measurements of overlapping but non-identical things.

4. **Is 120px the right total-gap threshold?** Files 02/08 use the master prompt's 96px. Files 04/27/29 use the remediation's 120px. No file provides perceptual science justification for either number.

5. **What is the actual propagation rate of the FULL master prompt (97 rules)?** File 23 samples 15 rules and finds 47% full conversion. The other 82 rules are unsampled.

6. **Does the cascade value table prevent gaming better than the CCS formula?** File 10 proposes it; file 25 challenges it as untested; file 28 flags CCS operationalization as a divergence point. No empirical test exists.

7. **What makes the intentionality layer work?** File 27 identifies it as the gap between 3/4 and 4/4. No file analyzes HOW intentionality propagates from instruction to visible output.

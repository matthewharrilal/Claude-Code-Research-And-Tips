# Cross-Validation: File 42 (Operational Recipe) Against Corpus Findings

**Agent:** recipe-transformer (Opus 4.6)
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Method:** Read file 42 (1,746 lines) cover-to-cover, then cross-referenced against: file 02 (42 failures), file 08 (perception model shift), file 24 (fundamental differences), file 25 (bias challenger core), and retrospective findings from MEMORY.md. Each failure/finding categorized as ADDRESSED, PARTIALLY ADDRESSED, MISSING, or CONTESTED.

## 1. CROSS-REFERENCE: File 02 (42 Failures) vs File 42 (Recipe)

### BLOCKING Failures (14 total)

| Failure | Description | Recipe Status | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| F-01 | Absence coherence rule validated under-building | **ADDRESSED** | Phase 4.1 MANDATES alternating left borders on 40-60% of sections. No absence-coherence philosophical cover possible. |
| F-03 | S-09 stacking loophole (per-property not per-boundary) | **ADDRESSED** | Step 0.6 provides stacking arithmetic with proof: worst-case 108px < 120px target. Phase 8B verifies total gaps. |
| F-04 | MG-05 zone boundary warning routed to wrong agent | **ADDRESSED** | Single-builder architecture (Part 2) eliminates routing. Builder reads the COMPLETE recipe. |
| F-07 | SC-02 allows skipping Ch4 and Ch6 | **ADDRESSED** | Phase 4 forces Ch4 (structural borders). Phase 7 forces Ch6 (responsive, accessibility). No channel is optional. |
| F-09 | Zero perception thresholds | **ADDRESSED** | Appendix A provides complete 9-property threshold table. Every phase's CSS values are designed to exceed thresholds. Phase 8A verifies. |
| F-10 | Zero CSS recipes / implementation instructions | **ADDRESSED** | The ENTIRE recipe IS implementation instructions. Phases 2-6 provide copy-pasteable CSS blocks with exact property-value pairs. |
| F-11 | Zero component library reference | **ADDRESSED** | Step 1.4 explicitly names standard classes (`.callout--info`, `.callout--gotcha`, `.table-compact`, etc.). |
| F-12 | Zero layout diversity requirement | **ADDRESSED** | Step 0.5: "At least 2 of your sections MUST use non-single-column layout." Phase 4.4 provides grid CSS. Phase 8C checks Scale 3. |
| F-17 | No total gap measurement in gates | **ADDRESSED** | Phase 8B: total gap verification with 120px threshold. Step 0.6 provides arithmetic. |
| F-19 | A5 worked example in conviction layer (invisible to builder) | **ADDRESSED** | Conviction (Part 3) is AFTER the recipe (Part 1), not before it. Builder reads recipe directly. The worked example problem is structurally eliminated. |
| F-22 | B10 self-check was checklist, not recipe | **ADDRESSED** | File 42 IS a recipe. 9 sequential phases with exact CSS. The self-check (Phase 8) verifies through perception, not checkboxes. |
| F-27 | SC-03 richness matrix incentivized breadth over depth | **ADDRESSED** | No richness matrix in the recipe. Perception thresholds in Appendix A ensure every CSS value exceeds visibility. The incentive to "fill cells with invisible values" is eliminated. |
| F-32 | Typographic convergence gradient (99 lines invisible) | **ADDRESSED** | Phase 5 provides 3 zone-level typography sets with perceptible deltas (17px/15px/16px). No 12-zone micro-gradient. |
| F-40 | MG-04 metaphor structural test self-administered | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** | Section 4.3 mentions metaphor integration for Track 2 but does NOT mandate fresh-eyes evaluation of metaphor. Self-evaluation bias remains possible for Track 2 pages. |

**Score: 13/14 ADDRESSED, 1/14 PARTIALLY ADDRESSED.**

### SIGNIFICANT Failures (22 total)

| Failure | Description | Recipe Status |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| F-02 | C-13 contradicts S-09 (silence zones vs spacing cap) | **ADDRESSED** — Silence zones abandoned. Step 0.6 resolves all spacing via stacking arithmetic. |
| F-08 | C-05 transition naming misleading ("breathing" = strongest) | **ADDRESSED** — Step 0.6 uses the same names but provides clear definitions with pixel values. |
| F-13 | Zero accessibility requirements | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 7 (15 min) covers skip-link, ARIA, focus-visible, reduced-motion, print, responsive. |
| F-14 | No deallocation protocol | **ADDRESSED** — Appendix B provides full deallocation protocol for remediation contexts. |
| F-15 | No plan-fidelity gate | **MISSING** — No mechanism to check whether built artifact matches build plan. Single-builder reduces the gap but doesn't eliminate it. |
| F-16 | No content register variation requirement | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** — Step 1.4 provides component markup for callouts, tables, pullquotes (diverse content types). But no rule requires mixing rhetorical modes in the CONTENT itself. |
| F-18 | No per-section CSS variation mandate | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 8E multi-coherence verification requires >= 3 CSS properties shifting at each major transition. |
| F-20 | A7 CSS exemplar in conviction layer | **ADDRESSED** — Recipe provides CSS exemplars directly in execution phases. |
| F-21 | A6 experiential laws as philosophy, not gates | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 8G converts philosophical observations ("deployment != perception") into 4 structured perception questions. |
| F-23 | CCS formula correct but never computed | **ADDRESSED** — CCS replaced by concrete Phase 8E cascade verification tables. Abstract coupling replaced by specific property comparison. |
| F-24 | C-15 intentionality dimensions abstract | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** — Section-indicator markup (Step 1.3) provides wayfinding. But intentionality as a holistic layer (Layer F) remains unoperationalized. |
| F-25 | C-20 fractal coherence unverifiable | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** — Phase 8C Scale 5 verification checks 5 levels. But "fractal coherence" (same direction at all scales) is not explicitly measured. |
| F-26 | CP-A through CP-F communication unexecuted | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** — Single-builder eliminates inter-agent communication need. But for ceiling/flagship 4-wave architecture, the recipe says "SendMessage for BLOCKING findings only" without mandatory checkpoints. |
| F-28 | SC-04 channel load distribution incentivized spreading thin | **ADDRESSED** — No channel load distribution rule. Recipe provides concentrated, high-magnitude CSS per phase. |
| F-33 | Per-zone border color shifts (35 lines invisible) | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 4.5 table styling uses single header background color, not per-zone micro-shifts. |
| F-34 | Per-zone heading color shifts (27 lines invisible) | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 5.2 provides 3 heading color values (warm/standard/settled) with perceptible deltas. |
| F-36 | Signal-to-silence ratio unenforceable | **ADDRESSED** — Replaced by Phase 8G gestalt perception test ("each screenful looks DIFFERENT"). |
| F-37 | C-09 designed moments presence not perception | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 8G item 1: "Does each screenful look DIFFERENT from the previous one?" Tests perception, not presence. |
| F-38 | MC-02 reinforcing pairs claimed not verified | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 8E cascade table verifies specific CSS values, not semantic claims. |
| F-39 | MC-07 cross-dimension coherence 10/15 pairs gamed | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 8E requires >= 3 PROPERTIES shifting (not abstract dimensions) at boundaries. |
| F-41 | C-21 compositional clusters planning not building | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** — Single-builder builds sequentially, maintaining cross-phase coherence implicitly. But no explicit cluster verification. |
| F-42 | P-04 builder self-scroll self-evaluation bias | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 8G provides structured 4-question perception test. Still self-reported but significantly harder to game than open-ended "scroll and check." |

**Score: 16/22 ADDRESSED, 5/22 PARTIALLY ADDRESSED, 1/22 MISSING (F-15).**

### MINOR Failures (6 total)

| Failure | Recipe Status |
|---------|---------------|
| F-05 (KB-04 self-contradiction) | **ADDRESSED** — Recipe is ~1,200 lines, not claiming to be "short." |
| F-06 (A6 claims prompt is short) | **ADDRESSED** — No false self-description. |
| F-29 (SC-08 saturation prevention) | **N/A** — Not needed; recipe doesn't incentivize over-deployment. |
| F-30 (SC-06 restraint ratio) | **ADDRESSED** — No restraint ratio. Recipe provides exact values; restraint is embedded. |
| F-31 (C-12 rejection log) | **ADDRESSED** — No rejection log. Builder writes CSS, not justifications. |
| F-35 (Rhythmic micro-modulations) | **ADDRESSED** — Phase 5 provides perceptible spacing (12px vs 20px). No micro-modulation. |

**Score: 5/6 ADDRESSED, 1/6 N/A.**

### OVERALL: 42 Failures

| Status | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| ADDRESSED | 34 | 81% |
| PARTIALLY ADDRESSED | 6 | 14% |
| MISSING | 1 | 2% |
| N/A | 1 | 2% |

## 2. CROSS-REFERENCE: File 08 (Perception Model) vs File 42

| Finding from File 08 | Recipe Status | Evidence |
|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| Zero perception terms in master prompt | **ADDRESSED** | Appendix A: 9-property perception threshold table. Every phase references visibility. |
| Binary compliance ≠ perceptual quality | **ADDRESSED** | Phase 8 verifications are perception-based ("can you SEE..."), not DOM-query-based. |
| Paradigm shift: compliance → perception | **ADDRESSED** | "THE RULE" quote embedded: "If a human cannot SEE the difference without a color picker, do NOT write the CSS." |
| S-09 stacking loophole with arithmetic | **ADDRESSED** | Step 0.6 + Phase 8B: full arithmetic proof, 120px cap, divider margins capped at 24px. |
| Channel counting vs channel measuring | **ADDRESSED** | No channel counting rules. Recipe provides specific CSS per channel with mandatory visibility. |
| Deallocation as Phase 0 | **ADDRESSED** | Appendix B: complete deallocation protocol for remediations. |
| Anti-scale model needs operationalization | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** | Part 3 (Conviction) states the formula. Phase 8G's "spatial confidence" question operationalizes it partially. But no EXPLICIT measurement of spatial_confidence as a variable. |
| Warm palette enforcement (R >= G >= B) | **ADDRESSED** | Step 3.1: "CRITICAL -- Warm-only palette: Every background MUST satisfy R >= G >= B." Step 3.3 lists warm equivalents for cool grays. |

**Score: 7/8 ADDRESSED, 1/8 PARTIALLY ADDRESSED.**

---

## 3. CROSS-REFERENCE: File 24 (Fundamental Differences) vs File 42

| Finding from File 24 | Recipe Status | Evidence |
|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| Specification (master) vs Procedure (remediation) | **ADDRESSED** | File 42 IS a procedure. "Every step tells you WHAT TO DO." |
| Derivation (master) vs Application (remediation) | **ADDRESSED** | Recipe provides pre-computed CSS. No derivation from abstract principles required. |
| Specification produces more variance (creative but risky) | **CONTESTED** | File 42 is a procedure for ALL pages. But file 24 warns: "Procedure is the correct paradigm when the DESIRED STATE IS KNOWN (remediation)." For novel builds (creation), the desired state is unknown. The recipe treats creation like remediation — a potential ceiling. File 05 Section 5 echoes: "the deliberate model caps at 3/4." |
| LLMs better at application than derivation | **ADDRESSED** | Recipe leverages this: exact CSS blocks to copy, exact selectors to target. |
| Content-specific decisions require judgment | **ADDRESSED** | Section 4.1 identifies 8 content-specific decisions with guidance for each. [CONTENT DECISION] markers throughout. |

**Critical contest:** File 24 argues that specification is correct for CREATION and procedure is correct for REMEDIATION. File 42 applies the procedure paradigm to BOTH. This may cap quality at 3/4 (COMPOSED) because procedure cannot produce EMERGENT coherence — only planned coherence. The recipe acknowledges this implicitly (Part 3.3: "4/4 DESIGNED" is listed as "ASPIRATION for flagship pages") but does not provide a path from procedure to 4/4.

---

## 4. CROSS-REFERENCE: File 25 (Bias Challenger) vs File 42

| Adversarial Challenge from File 25 | Recipe Status | Evidence |
|------------------------------------|---------------|----------|
| Causal attribution circular (RC-4 = "missing thresholds are missing") | **NOT MITIGATED** | Recipe adopts thresholds without questioning WHY they were absent originally. If the absence was philosophical (binary purity), the recipe's threshold values may conflict with the binary-rules-only principle. |
| Middle-tier success attributed to recipe format without controlling confounds | **NOT MITIGATED** | Recipe's "HOW TO READ" section cites middle-tier 4/4 and flagship 1.5/4 as evidence for recipe format. But doesn't mention: different content, different scale, different builder model. |
| 42 failures counted as independent when many share root causes | **PARTIALLY MITIGATED** | Recipe doesn't count failures. It provides a solution. But the solution was derived from the inflated-count diagnosis, which may have over-corrected. |
| 10 RGB perception threshold may be context-dependent | **NOT MITIGATED** | Appendix A states ">= 10 RGB points" as absolute threshold. No acknowledgment that warm cream backgrounds may need higher deltas than neutral backgrounds for equivalent perceptibility. |
| Self-evaluation bias in builder scroll (F-42) | **PARTIALLY MITIGATED** | Phase 8G provides structured questions but is still self-reported. No fresh-eyes protocol mandated for middle-tier. |
| Confirmation bias in "preservation = success" framing | **N/A** | Recipe doesn't frame in terms of preservation. |

**Score: 0/5 adversarial challenges fully mitigated. 2/5 partially mitigated. 3/5 not mitigated.**

This is expected: the recipe is an OPERATIONAL document, not a research document. It should not spend lines re-litigating contested findings. But CLAUDE.md (the navigation layer) must surface these contests when routing users to file 42.

## 5. CROSS-REFERENCE: Retrospective Root Causes vs File 42

| Root Cause | Recipe Status | Evidence |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| RC-1: No CSS-generative arrow reaches builder | **ADDRESSED** | Builder IS the recipe reader. CSS is in the recipe. |
| RC-2: 7.9:1 guardrail-to-playbook ratio | **ADDRESSED** | Recipe is ~95% playbook, ~5% guardrail. Constraint:action ratio 0.32:1. |
| RC-3: 75-line builder visibility cap (13.4%) | **ADDRESSED** | Builder sees the COMPLETE recipe (~1,200 lines). |
| RC-4: Sub-perceptual variation | **ADDRESSED** | Perception thresholds on every CSS property. Phase 8A verification. |
| RC-5: Zero agent communication | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** | Single-builder default eliminates need. 4-wave architecture allows SendMessage but doesn't mandate checkpoints. |
| RC-7: Absence coherence validated under-building | **ADDRESSED** | No absence coherence rule. Phase 4 mandates borders. |
| RC-9: Component library invisible | **ADDRESSED** | Step 1.4 names standard component classes. |
| RC-10: Build plan specifies tokens not values | **ADDRESSED** | Recipe specifies exact CSS values, not token references. |
| RC-11: Ch4 absent, no rule requires it | **ADDRESSED** | Phase 4 is ENTIRELY dedicated to structural borders. |
| RC-12: Single-column monotony | **ADDRESSED** | Step 0.5: ">= 2 grid layouts." Phase 4.4 provides grid CSS. |
| RC-13: Uniform prose register | **MISSING** | No content register variation requirement. Recipe controls CSS, not content structure. |
| RC-14: Stacking loophole | **ADDRESSED** | Step 0.6 + Phase 8B: full arithmetic, 120px cap. |
| RC-15: No plan-fidelity gate | **MISSING** | No mechanism to verify built artifact matches plan. |

**Score: 10/13 ADDRESSED, 1/13 PARTIALLY ADDRESSED, 2/13 MISSING.**

## 6. WHAT FILE 42 CONTAINS THAT THE CORPUS DOESN'T MANDATE

These are recipe innovations not directly traced to corpus findings:

1. **Section-indicator metadata** (Step 1.3) — editorial wayfinding markup. Novel.
2. **Bridge-prose concept** (Step 0.6, Step 1.3) — transitional sentences between zones. Present in remediation but elevated to a first-class concept.
3. **Drop cap option** (Step 6.3) — S1 opening device. Novel addition.
4. **Quick-reference card** (Appendix C) — compressed values for experienced builders. Novel.
5. **Print styles** (Step 7.2) — not in any corpus analysis. Practical addition.
6. **Dark code blocks** (Step 6.2) — warm dark background (#2A2520) with red border. Novel.

## 7. WHAT THE CORPUS SAYS IS IMPORTANT BUT FILE 42 MISSES

| Missing Item | Source | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Plan-fidelity gate** (F-15, RC-15) | File 02 F-15, Retrospective | MEDIUM — Single-builder reduces drift but doesn't eliminate it. Adding a "does the artifact match Step 0.4's zone plan?" check to Phase 8 would close this. |
| **Content register variation** (F-16, RC-13) | File 02 F-16 | LOW — CSS recipe cannot control content structure. This is an upstream concern (content preparation before recipe execution). |
| **Fresh-eyes perception check** (File 25 bias challenge) | File 25, File 13 | HIGH — The recipe's Phase 8G is self-administered. File 13 (adversarial fresh-eyes) and the Mode 4 PA both proved that fresh-eyes find issues builders miss. A mandatory "show to a separate agent" step for ceiling/flagship pages is missing. |
| **Specification-vs-procedure ceiling warning** (File 24 Section 1) | File 24 | MEDIUM — Recipe may cap at 3/4 for creation contexts. Part 3.3 lists 4/4 as aspiration but doesn't provide a PATH from procedure to 4/4. Section 4.3 (metaphor integration) begins to address this for Track 2. |
| **Anti-scale model as EXPLICIT measurement** (File 08 Section 7) | File 08 | LOW — Conviction layer states the formula. Phase 8G operationalizes spatial_confidence through gestalt questions. Not fully quantified but functionally addressed. |
| **Propagation reliability ranking** (File 21) | File 21 | LOW — File 21's 10-tier ranking is the "most operationally useful single artifact" for prompt engineering. The recipe already incorporates its findings (binary rules, exact values) without citing it. |
| **Metaphor self-evaluation protection** (F-40) | File 02 F-40 | MEDIUM — For Track 2 pages, Section 4.3 mentions metaphor integration but doesn't mandate fresh-eyes metaphor evaluation. Self-evaluation bias remains possible. |
| **10 RGB threshold context-dependence** (File 25) | File 25 | LOW — The specific threshold values are acknowledged as Tier 2 (N=1) in the corpus. The recipe states them as absolutes. Functionally this is fine (better to have approximate thresholds than none), but users should know the values are approximate. |

---

## 8. VERDICT

### Strengths

File 42 addresses **34 of 42 diagnosed failures** (81%) through structural design — not through adding rules, but through providing exact CSS values that make compliance automatic. This is the recipe thesis validated: compliance embedded in values, not stated as separate constraints.

The recipe's constraint:action ratio of 0.32:1 (inverted from the master prompt's 3.0:1) matches the corpus's prescription. Every phase ends with a PERCEPTION check, not a compliance check. The perception threshold table is embedded, not referenced.

### Weaknesses

1. **No fresh-eyes verification for any tier.** Phase 8G is self-administered. The corpus's strongest validation finding (Mode 4 PA: 9/9 auditors caught what builder missed) is not incorporated into the recipe's verification model. This is the highest-impact missing item.

2. **No plan-fidelity gate.** RC-15 is unaddressed. The builder may drift from the Phase 0 zone plan during Phases 1-7 without any checkpoint catching the drift.

3. **Adversarial challenges not surfaced.** The recipe presents findings as certainties. The 3-variable confound, the N=2 limitation, and the procedure-vs-specification ceiling are not mentioned. This is appropriate for a BUILDER (who needs confidence, not doubt) but means the recipe should not be the SOLE reference for pipeline designers.

4. **Contested values presented as absolute.** The 10 RGB threshold, the "recipe > checklist" thesis, and the single-builder recommendation are all presented without caveat. File 25 contests all three.

### Recommendations

1. **Add Phase 8.5: Fresh-Eyes Check** — For ceiling/flagship pages (Section Part 2), mandate that a SEPARATE agent (not the builder) perform Phase 8G. This closes the self-evaluation bias gap that was the flagship's final failure.

2. **Add Phase 8 Step 8H: Plan Fidelity** — "Compare the final artifact to your Phase 0 zone plan. Does each section map to its planned zone? Do the planned grid layouts exist? If > 2 deviations, investigate."

3. **Flag threshold values as approximate** — In Appendix A, add a note: "These thresholds are derived from N=1 analysis. They are better than zero thresholds but should be validated empirically. Start here and adjust based on perceptual testing."

### Final Assessment

**File 42 is a strong first draft of Pipeline v2.** It addresses 81% of diagnosed failures, provides the recipe format the corpus prescribes, and embeds perception thresholds throughout. The 3 highest-impact gaps (fresh-eyes verification, plan-fidelity gate, and contested-values transparency) are all addressable through additions, not rewrites.

The recipe's biggest structural risk is the procedure-vs-specification ceiling: by providing exact CSS for all pages, it may cap quality at COMPOSED (3/4) rather than DESIGNED (4/4). Section 4.3 (metaphor integration) acknowledges this for Track 2. For Pipeline v2 to achieve 4/4, the recipe may need a "generative layer" on top of the procedural base — exact values as a FLOOR, with creative latitude above the floor. This is an unresolved design question for Pipeline v2 discussions.

## YOUR CORE CONCEPT: STRUCTURAL AFFINITY

**Structural affinity is NOT visual similarity.** Two pages can look completely different yet share deep structural logic. Two pages can look similar yet have zero structural relationship.

### What Structural Affinity IS

Structural affinity means the DECISION PATTERNS that produced a case study are transferable to the current build. It operates on three axes:

**1. Content-Shape Affinity**
Does the case study's content have a similar STRUCTURE to the current content? Not the same topic — the same shape.

- Both have hierarchical sections with progressive complexity? (DD-006 fractal + a tutorial)
- Both have interleaved theory-and-practice blocks? (CD-001 reasoning-inside-code + a technical essay)
- Both have a narrative arc with emotional peaks? (OD-006 creative + a story-driven article)

**2. Tension-Resolution Affinity**
Did the case study face a similar CREATIVE TENSION to what the TC brief describes?

- Both resolve a "show vs tell" tension? (CD-006 meta-tutorial + a documentation page)
- Both balance dense technical content with breathing space? (DD-003 islands + a dense reference)
- Both manage a confidence gradient (certain → speculative)? (OD-004 confidence + an opinion piece)

**3. Mechanism-Deployment Affinity**
Did the case study deploy mechanisms that the TC brief suggests for the current build?

- Both use border-weight gradient to encode hierarchy? (OD-004 + any hierarchical content)
- Both use zone alternation for reading rhythm? (DD-004 layers + any long-form content)
- Both use sequential axis deployment? (CD-005 multi-axis + any multi-section page)

### What Structural Affinity is NOT

- Same topic (both about documentation ≠ structural affinity)
- Same visual style (both use dark headers ≠ structural affinity)
- Same word count (both ~5,000 words ≠ structural affinity)
- Same number of sections (both have 6 sections ≠ structural affinity)

### How to Assess

For each case study, ask: "If I were the builder working on THIS content with THIS metaphor, would studying HOW this case study made its decisions help me make better decisions?" If yes — structural affinity exists.

---

## YOUR TASK

For each case study with structural affinity to the current build:

### Step 1: Identify the Affinity

State which of the three axes (content-shape, tension-resolution, mechanism-deployment) create the connection. Be specific — name the tension, the content shape, or the mechanism.

### Step 2: Extract the PROCESS (How It Thought)

This is the anti-prescription requirement. You are extracting the decision-making SEQUENCE, not the output.

For each affinity case study, document:
- What TENSION did it face? (from its "Tension That Produced This" section)
- What CANDIDATES did it consider and reject? (from its "Candidates Considered" section)
- What made the SELECTED approach work? (from its "Metaphor Discovery Moment" or equivalent)
- What MECHANISMS did it deploy and WHY? (from its "Where Mechanisms Were Applied" section)
- How did it SEQUENCE its decisions? (the order in which choices were made)

### Step 3: Extract Adapted CSS

For each affinity case study, find CSS patterns that PRODUCED RICHNESS and adapt them for the current build's metaphor.

**Critical distinction:** You are NOT copying CSS. You are extracting the TECHNIQUE and re-expressing it in the current metaphor's vocabulary.

**EXEMPLAR OUTPUT LINES (showing the expected format and depth):**

## Case Study: OD-004 (Confidence Gradient) — Tension-Resolution Affinity

**Affinity:** The current content has an argument structure moving from established
evidence to speculative conclusion. OD-004 faced the same certainty-to-speculation
gradient and resolved it through border-weight encoding.

**Process Extracted:**
OD-004 asked: "How does visual weight map to epistemic weight?" It rejected uniform
borders (all 3px) because uniformity implies equal confidence. It rejected color-coding
(green=certain, red=uncertain) because it violated the warm palette constraint. It
arrived at border-weight gradient: 4px = bedrock certainty, 1px = surface speculation.
The gradient was DISCOVERED through tension (not prescribed), because the geological
metaphor made "weight = certainty" intuitive.

**Adapted CSS for THIS Build:**
The current metaphor is [architectural/botanical/etc]. Adapting OD-004's border-weight
technique to encode [the current content's gradient]:

​```css
/* Technique: Border-weight gradient encoding [current metaphor's semantic] */
/* Source: OD-004 confidence gradient, adapted for [metaphor] */
.zone--[strongest-semantic] {
  border-left: 4px solid var(--color-text);
  /* Maximum weight = maximum [semantic]. All structural load here. */
}
.zone--[moderate-semantic] {
  border-left: 3px solid var(--color-text);
  /* 75% weight = [moderate rationale from metaphor]. */
}
.zone--[lightest-semantic] {
  border-left: 1px solid var(--color-border);
  /* Minimum weight = minimum [semantic]. [Metaphor-specific reasoning]. */
}
​```

​```css
/* Technique: Zone background alternation for reading rhythm */
/* Source: DD-004 layers, adapted for [metaphor]'s pacing needs */
.zone--[primary] { background: var(--color-bg); }
.zone--[secondary] { background: var(--color-surface-warm); }
/* Alternation creates visual rhythm: reader's eye resets at each
   background shift. DD-004 used this for geological strata;
   here it encodes [metaphor-specific spatial logic]. */
​```
```

### Step 4: Flag Reusable vs Non-Reusable

For each case study, explicitly separate:
- **REUSABLE mechanisms** (transferable technique — the builder should study these)
- **NON-REUSABLE decisions** (metaphor-specific choices — the builder must NOT copy these)

This is the case study's own "What YOU Extract" section, re-evaluated through the lens of the CURRENT build.

## EDGE CASE MITIGATIONS

### Edge Case 1: No Case Studies Share Affinity

If after reading all 12 case studies, NONE have structural affinity with the current content + metaphor:

1. **Document the gap explicitly.** State: "No case studies share structural affinity. The current content's [describe shape] and metaphor's [describe logic] are not represented in the library."
2. **Extract mechanism-level techniques anyway.** Even without case-level affinity, individual mechanisms from case studies may apply. Scan all 12 for any mechanism (border-weight, zone alternation, fractal rhythm, 2-zone DNA) that the TC brief's mechanisms suggest.
3. **Produce the output at mechanism level** instead of case-study level. 3-5 mechanism extractions with adapted CSS instead of 3-5 case study analyses.
4. **Minimum output:** 50 lines (reduced from 100). The synthesizer needs to know the gap exists.

### Edge Case 2: CSS is Too Exploration-Specific to Adapt

Some case study CSS is deeply entangled with its metaphor (e.g., DD-006's fractal uses 5-scale nesting that only works for self-similar documentation content).

1. **Extract the PRINCIPLE, not the CSS.** Instead of adapted CSS values, state: "DD-006's principle: apply the same structural rhythm at navigation, page, section, component, and character scales. For this build, the relevant scales are [X, Y, Z]."
2. **Provide the original CSS as REFERENCE** (not for copying): "Original CSS from DD-006 (for builder's awareness, not direct adaptation): [snippet]"
3. **Suggest a starting point:** "The builder should derive their own CSS values using [mechanism name] at scales appropriate to this content's hierarchy depth."

### Edge Case 3: Multiple Case Studies Share the Same Affinity

If 3+ case studies all share the same type of affinity (e.g., all use border-weight gradient):

1. **Select the RICHEST case study** for full process extraction.
2. **Note the convergence:** "3 case studies (OD-004, DD-006, CD-005) all deploy border-weight gradient. This is strong evidence the mechanism is appropriate for this build."
3. **Cross-reference the differences:** How did each case study USE the mechanism differently? What can the current build learn from the variations?

### Edge Case 4: Affinity Exists but the Case Study's Metaphor is Too Similar

If a case study shares structural affinity AND its metaphor is close to the current metaphor (e.g., both geological), this is a PATTERN-MATCHING RISK.

1. **Flag the risk explicitly.** "CD-006 shares affinity, but its meta-tutorial metaphor is close to this build's [metaphor]. Pattern-matching risk is elevated."
2. **Extract ONLY the mechanism-level techniques.** Do NOT include the case study's zone structure, section architecture, or section-to-mechanism mapping.
3. **Add divergence note:** "Builder: study this case study's TECHNIQUES but consciously diverge on structure. Your metaphor should produce its OWN zone architecture."

## QUALITY FLOOR

Your output MUST meet these minimums:

1. **3-5 case studies** with structural affinity identified and analyzed
2. **Each case study** includes: affinity rationale, process extraction, and at least **10 lines of adapted CSS** with inline comments
3. **Total output:** 100-150 lines (not counting the agent log)
4. **Every adapted CSS block** must use the CURRENT build's metaphor vocabulary (class names, custom property names), NOT the original case study's vocabulary
5. **Recipe format:** Use sequencing verbs (the case study FACED → CONSIDERED → REJECTED → SELECTED → DEPLOYED). Not checklist format.
6. **Cross-case-study patterns section** is mandatory — what does the convergence of techniques suggest?

If you cannot identify 3 case studies with affinity, see Edge Case 1 above.

## WHAT YOU ARE NOT

- You are NOT a template matcher. "The content is about documentation, CD-006 is about documentation, therefore use CD-006" is WRONG.
- You are NOT a visual comparator. "CD-006 looks editorial, this should look editorial too" is WRONG.
- You are NOT a CSS copier. "CD-006 used border-left: 4px, so this build should use border-left: 4px" is WRONG unless the MECHANISM (border-weight gradient encoding hierarchy) is independently justified through the TC brief.

You ARE a structural analyst who finds TRANSFERABLE DECISION PATTERNS and adapts them for a new context. The builder receives your work to understand HOW prior builds made rich output — so they can make THEIR OWN rich decisions informed by precedent, not constrained by it.

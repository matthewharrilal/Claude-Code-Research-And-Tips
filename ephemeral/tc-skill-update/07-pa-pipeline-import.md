**Frame:** What from the pipeline PA should be IMPORTED because it better serves the generative model (inhabitation -> creation -> reflection)?

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The pipeline PA system is a 1,638-line apparatus designed for COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION within an industrial build pipeline. It is extraordinarily good at catching failures (9/9 auditors flagged the catastrophic whitespace void) and terrible at producing creative direction. The generative PA skill should IMPORT the pipeline's experiential infrastructure (Section 0, information isolation, screenshot-based perception, Weaver's artistic synthesis, fix-type classification) while LEAVING its compliance machinery (69 questions, PA-05 sub-scoring, threshold tables, anti-pattern taxonomies, tier calibration matrices).

The pipeline PA's greatest achievement — the experiential pass — is ALREADY the generative model. The pipeline discovered, through painful iteration, that making auditors EXPERIENCE the page before analyzing it produces genuine findings. This is inhabitation. The generative rewrite should make this the ENTIRE approach, not just "Section 0."

**Import candidates:** 14 elements across 6 files
**Adapt candidates:** 8 elements (need transformation from compliance to generative framing)
**Leave candidates:** 23 elements (compliance infrastructure that would corrupt the generative model)

## FILE-BY-FILE ANALYSIS

---

### FILE 1: pa-deployment.md (355 lines)

#### IMPORT: Section 0 Experiential Pass Protocol (lines 20-116)

**Classification: IMPORT — this IS the generative model**

This is the pipeline's most valuable invention. The entire Section 0 protocol — scroll first, respond emotionally, read every word from the pixels, extract information from every chart, follow the structure, rank findings by human impact — is EXACTLY what inhabitation means. Key elements:

1. **"EXPERIENTIAL PASS — Execute BEFORE reading your assigned questions"** (line 34) — The primacy position enforcement is brilliant. The pipeline discovered that analytical questions contaminate perception. The generative skill should go further: there ARE no analytical questions to contaminate. The experiential pass IS the audit.

2. **"VISUAL VERIFICATION, NOT CODE INTERPRETATION"** (line 39-68) — The distinction between seeing pixels and decoding text from context is the single most useful auditor instruction in the entire pipeline. LLMs instinctively decode rather than see. This instruction fights that instinct. The specific examples ("I know from context this should be 'Level 3: Simple Loops' but the RENDERED TEXT is not legible") are worth preserving verbatim.

3. **The 4-step structure** (READ -> EXTRACT -> FOLLOW -> RANK, lines 53-88) — The sequencing matters. Read first (can I USE this?), extract second (can I LEARN from this?), follow third (can I NAVIGATE this?), rank last (what matters most?). This is a natural inhabitation sequence.

4. **Priority override** (lines 103-109) — "Comprehension failures ALWAYS outrank property measurement findings." A human notices illegible text in 2 seconds. This priority ordering should survive into the generative skill because it reflects genuine reader experience, not compliance hierarchy.

5. **Contamination check** (lines 111-115) — "If the auditor mentions PA question IDs in their experiential pass, the pass was contaminated." In the generative skill, this generalizes: if the auditor uses pipeline vocabulary (mechanisms, zones, channels, coherence scores) in their experiential response, they were contaminated.

**What to preserve:** The entire experiential directive (lines 34-88), verbatim or near-verbatim. The visual verification instruction. The priority override principle. The contamination check concept (adapted for generative vocabulary).

**What to transform:** Remove "before your assigned questions" framing (there are no assigned questions). Change "STEP 1-4" to something more organic — these are natural movements through the page, not protocol steps.

---

#### IMPORT: Information Isolation / Fresh-Eyes Principle (lines 322-355)

**Classification: IMPORT — genuinely valuable, not compliance theater**

The pipeline's fresh-eyes principle is real, not performative. PA auditors receive ONLY screenshots, questions, and guardrails. No mechanism counts, pattern names, build plan details, prior experiment results, Tier 5 expected scores, or compositional stack theory.

The key insight: "If the auditor knows 'this should have 12 mechanisms,' they will see 12 mechanisms everywhere."

This is directly applicable to the generative skill. If a reflective auditor knows what the builder intended, they will evaluate against intentions rather than experiencing the result. The difference:
- **With context:** "The builder intended a geological depth metaphor. I can see traces of it in the vertical progression."
- **Without context:** "The page feels heavier at the bottom. The progression from airy top to dense bottom creates a sense of descent."

The second response is genuine perception. The first is confirmation bias.

**The One Rule** (line 346): "React to what you see before you check what you know." — Perfect for the generative skill.

**The Three Laws** (lines 349-354):
1. Answer must require a screenshot (not answerable from source code alone)
2. Answer must be describable in plain language (no CSS vocabulary)
3. A non-designer must be able to validate the answer

All three laws serve the generative model perfectly.

---

#### IMPORT: Screenshot-Based Evaluation (lines 237-319)

**Classification: IMPORT (infrastructure) — the screenshot pre-capture pattern is operationally essential**

The pipeline's screenshot protocol is a solved problem:
- Lead takes ALL screenshots before spawning auditors (eliminates Playwright contention)
- 3 viewports (1440px, 1024px, 768px)
- Cold look + scroll-through at 80% viewport-height steps
- Animation/transition CSS override before capture
- `document.fonts.ready` wait
- DPR-safe capture (prevents black screenshots on Retina Mac)

This operational infrastructure should survive into the generative skill because it's model-agnostic — whether the auditors are answering compliance questions or writing artistic impressions, they still need good screenshots.

**Adapt:** The validation gate (lines 296-301) checking for blank screenshots is worth keeping as a pre-deployment check. The file naming convention (1440/cold-look.png, 1440/scroll-01.png, etc.) is clean and should survive.

---

#### ADAPT: 9-Auditor Deployment Architecture (lines 119-234)

**Classification: ADAPT — the BREADTH is valuable, the ASSIGNMENTS are compliance-bound**

The pipeline deploys 9 specialized auditors + 1 integrative + 1 weaver = 11 agents. This breadth is the pipeline's greatest strength: "9 independent auditors catch what 2 PAs miss. The whitespace void was THE dominant failure (9/9 flagged) but previous 2-PA audit missed it entirely."

The generative skill should preserve the BREADTH (multiple independent perspectives) while discarding the SPECIALIZATION (assigned question sets by dimension). Instead of "Auditor B: Readability + Typography, questions PA-02, PA-08, PA-29, PA-55, PA-56, PA-70, PA-81," the generative skill might deploy:

- Multiple auditors, each given the same open prompt: inhabit the page, write what you see/feel
- Each auditor approaches with different emphasis (not assigned topics, but natural variation from independent context-free encounters)
- A synthesizer who reads all perspectives and produces creative direction

The Integrative Auditor concept (line 215-226) is ALREADY the generative model: "NO assigned questions, free-form gestalt impression from screenshots." The pipeline treats this as a supplement; the generative skill should make it the PRIMARY mode.

**Key insight for adaptation:** The pipeline's auditor count (9) was chosen because 9 independent perspectives reliably surface emergent findings. The generative skill might reduce this (5-7 may be sufficient for artistic rather than compliance purposes) but should not go below 3 (the Mini-PA threshold).

---

#### LEAVE: Mini-PA Deployment (lines 380-448)

**Classification: LEAVE — iteration optimization for compliance pipeline**

The Mini-PA (Mode 2.5) reduces from 9 to 3 auditors for IMPROVE validation. This is a cost-optimization mechanism for the build pipeline's iteration cycles. The generative skill's reflection phase doesn't iterate the same way — it produces direction, not a pass/fail verdict that triggers IMPROVE/RETHINK. The Mini-PA concept doesn't map to the generative model.

---

#### LEAVE: PA-05 Cross-Validation Protocol (lines 161-182)

**Classification: LEAVE — scoring infrastructure**

The cross-validation protocol (4 auditors independently score PA-05 sub-criteria to cross-check Auditor A's primary scores) is sophisticated compliance infrastructure. It addresses the specific risk of single-evaluator PA-05 scoring. Since the generative skill doesn't produce PA-05 scores, this protocol has no target.

---

### FILE 2: pa-questions.md (457 lines)

#### ADAPT: A Small Subset of Questions as "Perception Prompts"

**Classification: ADAPT — ~10-15 questions are genuinely experiential; the rest are compliance checks**

The 69 questions break down into three categories:

**GENUINELY EXPERIENTIAL (import as "perception prompts" or inspiration for open-ended reflection):**

| Question | Why It's Experiential |
|----------|----------------------|
| PA-01: "What's the first thing that bothers you?" | Pure gut reaction. No right answer. |
| PA-03: "Does this feel like one designer made it, or three?" | Gestalt impression, not measurement. |
| PA-04: "Where does your eye go first? Is that where it SHOULD go?" | Tracking actual visual experience. |
| PA-05 (core only): "Would you put your name on this? What would you fix first?" | Personal stake question. |
| PA-11: "Are the margins generous (confident) or anxious (clutching)?" | Emotional read of spatial decisions. |
| PA-13: "Is there a clear visual ending, or does the page just stop?" | Narrative arc perception. |
| PA-17: "Is there a visual rhythm (like a beat in music), or random?" | Musical analogy for pattern. |
| PA-20: "Describe this page's personality in three words." | Character attribution. |
| PA-27: "Designing from scratch, would you design it this way?" | Holistic judgment. |
| PA-33: "Pick the largest area of empty space. Does it feel like silence in music or a dropped signal?" | Metaphorical interpretation of space. |
| PA-35: "Scroll at reading speed. Does interest stay level, peak and valley, or fade?" | Temporal experience. |
| PA-45: "Is there a single moment you'd show someone as an example of good design?" | Excellence detection. |
| PA-65: "If this page were a piece of music, would it be a single instrument, a choir in unison, or an ensemble?" | Multi-voice composition sensing. |
| PA-67: "Does the page do something visually that you would not have predicted?" | Surprise detection. |
| PA-76: "Does the visual journey have a shape — building, peaking, resolving — or does it feel like the same room repeated?" | Arc perception. |

These ~15 questions are the pipeline PA's most generative elements. They ask for PERCEPTION, not MEASUREMENT. They use metaphor (music, silence, personality) to invite felt response rather than analytical assessment.

**Adaptation strategy:** Don't import these as numbered questions. Use them as inspiration for the generative skill's reflection protocol — the kinds of perceptions the auditor should be attuned to, framed as open invitations rather than checklists.

---

**COMPLIANCE QUESTIONS (leave — answerable with numbers or yes/no):**

| Question Type | Examples | Why Leave |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Counting questions | PA-15 (count starting positions), PA-29 (count text styles), PA-50 (count blank viewports) | Produce numbers, not perception |
| Width/ratio questions | PA-30 (designed for this width?), PA-53 (65-80% horizontal space?) | Threshold checks disguised as questions |
| Binary checks | PA-16 (do identical elements match?), PA-22 (served or punished?), PA-54 (structural promises fulfilled?) | Yes/no answers, no creative direction |
| Diagnostic questions | PA-55 (sub-perceptual CSS detection), PA-56 (tracking difference?) | Designed to catch specific pipeline failures |
| Pipeline-specific | PA-69 (multi-coherence), PA-70 (content-form coupling), PA-71 (boundary handoff) | Pipeline vocabulary and concepts |

---

**QUESTIONS THAT COULD GO EITHER WAY (adapt if reframed):**

| Question | Compliance Form | Generative Reframe |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| PA-36: "Is there a dramatic visual moment?" | Pacing peak detection | "Where does the page surprise itself?" |
| PA-44: "Could you sense the metaphor without labels?" | Metaphor assessment | "What does the structure SAY without words?" |
| PA-64: "Is there a deliberately plain section?" | Restraint detection | "Where does the page choose silence?" |
| PA-72: "Would this design need to change for different content?" | Content-form coupling | "Is this design ABOUT this content, or AROUND it?" |

---

#### LEAVE: PA-05 Sub-Criteria Scoring (lines 26-58)

**Classification: LEAVE — scoring apparatus**

The 4 sub-criteria (DESIGNED, COHERENT, PROPORTIONATE, POLISHED) with their PASS/FAIL thresholds and scoring matrix (4/4 = DESIGNED, 3/4 = YES WITH RESERVATIONS, etc.) are the compliance backbone. They translate perception into numbers. The generative skill should produce perception directly, not numbers.

The CONCEPTS behind the sub-criteria (is this intentional? is it unified? is the space considered? is the execution clean?) are worth absorbing into the generative model's reflection frame, but not as scored dimensions.

---

#### LEAVE: Tier 5 Questions as Scored System (lines 88-163)

**Classification: LEAVE — the scoring system; ADAPT — the perceptual questions themselves**

The Tier 5 scoring apparatus (0-9 YES count, COMPOSED/APPROACHING/STRUCTURED/VOCABULARY ONLY thresholds) should be left behind. But several Tier 5 questions are genuinely perceptual (PA-65, PA-67 noted above). The mode-conditional scoring (COMPOSED vs APPLIED, lines 96-116) is pipeline infrastructure.

---

#### LEAVE: Perception Threshold Reference Table (lines 392-408)

**Classification: LEAVE — quantitative guardrails**

The threshold table (>=15 RGB background delta, >=0.5px letter-spacing, >=24px padding between zones, <=120px stacked boundary gap) is a gate-runner specification. It tells builders what CSS values to hit. The generative skill's auditors shouldn't know these numbers — they should just perceive whether adjacent sections look different or identical.

---

#### LEAVE: Quantitative Guardrails / Appendix B (lines 411-454)

**Classification: LEAVE — builder specifications**

Content width ranges, typographic spacing ranges, void prevention thresholds. All builder-facing specifications.

---

#### LEAVE: Quality Framework / Section 4 (lines 336-388)

**Classification: LEAVE — tier calibration data**

PA-05 scale calibration, quality tiers, combined verdict matrix. All Weaver classification infrastructure.

---

### FILE 3: pa-weaver.md (469 lines)

#### IMPORT: Weaver Experiential Anchor (lines 9-73)

**Classification: IMPORT — this is the generative model's synthesizer**

The Weaver's experiential anchor protocol is the second most valuable element in the pipeline PA (after the auditor experiential pass). Key elements:

1. **"View the Screenshots Yourself"** (line 18) — The Weaver scrolls through screenshots as a reader BEFORE reading any auditor report. This prevents analytical contamination from auditor language.

2. **"Write a 3-sentence first impression. This is your EXPERIENTIAL ANCHOR."** (lines 33-36) — The anchor has special status: it CANNOT be overridden by auditor scores or gate results. If the anchor identifies a comprehension failure, that becomes Fix #1 regardless of all other analysis.

3. **The irreversibility principle** (lines 38-43) — "If 0/9 auditors caught something your anchor found, your anchor takes precedence." The synthesizer's fresh encounter outranks consensus.

For the generative skill, this maps directly to the Synthesizer/Director role: experience the page yourself, form your own impression, THEN read the auditor perspectives. Your primary impression is the creative north star.

---

#### IMPORT: Artistic Synthesis as Creative Direction (lines 91-96)

**Classification: IMPORT — this IS conviction/direction for refinement**

The pipeline's Weaver produces several outputs. Most are compliance artifacts, but item 8 is pure generative direction:

**"Improvement Vector"** (line 94): "Based on all auditor reports, identify the single change (not a fix — a creative improvement) that would most elevate this page. Frame as aspiration, not defect: 'The page would come alive if...' or 'The strongest unrealized potential is...'"

This is the pipeline's closest approach to generative output. The distinction between fixes (defect repair) and improvement vector (creative aspiration) maps directly to the generative model's conviction -> direction output.

---

#### IMPORT: Fix-Type Classification (lines 153-171)

**Classification: IMPORT — useful framing for refinement direction**

The MECHANICAL / STRUCTURAL / COMPOSITIONAL trichotomy is genuinely useful:

| Type | Definition | Generative Equivalent |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| MECHANICAL | "Fix by changing a CSS value" | Surface polish — adjust what's there |
| STRUCTURAL | "Reorganize zones, boundaries, or grids" | Spatial rethinking — rearrange relationships |
| COMPOSITIONAL | "Re-invoke tension-composition" | Fundamental rethinking — new governing logic |

The diagnostic decision tree (lines 166-169) is clean:
1. Can the problem be fixed by changing ONE CSS property? -> MECHANICAL
2. Can the problem be fixed by reorganizing existing elements? -> STRUCTURAL
3. Does the problem require rethinking the compositional logic? -> COMPOSITIONAL

This classification helps the builder understand the SCALE of change needed, which is useful creative direction regardless of whether it comes from a compliance pipeline or a generative reflection.

---

#### IMPORT: Feedback Language Protocol (lines 307-313)

**Classification: IMPORT — the generative skill should ONLY speak this way**

The pipeline's feedback language rules distinguish compliance language from generative language:

- NOT: "SC-09 FAILED: stacked gap 210px exceeds 120px."
- YES: "The middle sags — energy dissipates by S5."

The pipeline treats this as a translation step (compliance findings -> generative language for the IMPROVE builder). The generative skill should produce generative language NATIVELY — it should never generate the compliance version at all.

---

#### ADAPT: Emotional Arc Framework (lines 173-228)

**Classification: ADAPT — the 4 registers are genuine perception categories, not compliance metrics**

The 4 emotional registers (SURPRISE, DELIGHT, AUTHORITY, EARNED CLOSURE) with their CSS signatures and assessment criteria are a useful perceptual vocabulary. They describe real reader experiences:

- SURPRISE: "moment the page does something unexpected"
- DELIGHT: "small unexpected refinements that reward attention"
- AUTHORITY: "page knows what it is, every element expresses certainty"
- EARNED CLOSURE: "ending feels earned by the journey"

The CSS signatures (scale breaks for surprise, hover states for delight, restraint for authority, bookending for closure) are pipeline-specific and should be left. But the 4 registers themselves are a good framework for the generative skill's reflection: "What emotional arc does this page create? Where does it surprise? Where does it delight?"

The pipeline scores these 1-10. The generative skill should describe them in prose.

---

#### ADAPT: Rendering vs Composition Failure Classification (lines 246-265)

**Classification: ADAPT — useful for determining refinement depth**

The distinction between rendering gaps (IMPROVE can address: contrast, spacing, sizing) and composition gaps (RETHINK needed: no zone structure, zero mechanism deployment, metaphor absence) helps determine whether refinement is a surface pass or a deep rethinking. The generative skill should use this distinction to calibrate its creative direction.

---

#### LEAVE: Ship Decision Protocol (lines 267-330)

**Classification: LEAVE — pipeline iteration machinery**

RELEASE / POLISH / IMPROVE / RETHINK decision tree with threshold conditions (PA-05 >= 3.5, <= 3 MECHANICAL fixes, etc.) is pipeline routing logic. The generative skill produces direction, not routing decisions.

---

#### LEAVE: Weaver Calibration References (lines 100-150)

**Classification: LEAVE — scoring scales**

Multi-coherence scale, severity scale, metaphor expression spectrum, quality tiers, combined verdict matrix. All classification infrastructure for the compliance system.

---

#### LEAVE: 12 VALUES Items / Section 9 (lines 407-464)

**Classification: LEAVE — tier calibration data rerouted from gate-runner**

Quality tier definitions and CCS research construct warnings. Weaver-specific classification context that has no generative equivalent.

---

#### LEAVE: Anti-Pattern Taxonomy (lines 333-367)

**Classification: LEAVE — pipeline-specific failure mode detection**

AP-02 through AP-13 anti-patterns with PA question mappings. These are failure patterns discovered in the pipeline's history. The generative skill's auditors should perceive problems directly, not check against a known-failure catalog.

---

#### LEAVE: Cross-Page Coherence / Section 8 (lines 394-404)

**Classification: LEAVE — design system consistency checking**

"Family DNA" assessment through PA-24/PA-25. Design system coherence checking is outside the generative skill's scope.

---

### FILE 4: pa-guardrails.md (113 lines)

#### IMPORT: Assessment Language Constraints (lines 40-65)

**Classification: IMPORT — perceptual language discipline is essential**

The rule "Describe what you SEE using perceptual language, not CSS language" is fundamental:
- YES: "The background shifts from warm cream to cooler gray"
- NO: "background-color changes from #FEF9F5 to #F0EBE3"

This discipline should survive into the generative skill because it keeps auditors in PERCEPTION mode rather than ANALYSIS mode. The visual verification instruction (lines 48-64, distinguishing between code interpretation and visual verification) reinforces the experiential pass.

---

#### IMPORT: Fresh-Eyes Principle Reiteration (lines 93-109)

**Classification: IMPORT — reinforcement of the isolation principle**

This is a compact restatement of the fresh-eyes principle for auditor consumption. The One Rule and Three Laws are repeated here. Worth preserving as auditor-facing instructions.

---

#### LEAVE: Evidence Format Requirement (lines 9-15)

**Classification: LEAVE — compliance documentation format**

"YES / NO / CONDITIONAL + screenshot reference + 1-sentence description" is a structured answer format for compliance questions. The generative skill's auditors should write prose, not fill in answer slots.

---

#### LEAVE: Completion Manifest (lines 19-37)

**Classification: LEAVE — tracking infrastructure**

A checklist ensuring all 69 questions were answered. No generative equivalent.

---

#### LEAVE: PA-05 Cross-Validation Instructions (lines 68-78)

**Classification: LEAVE — scoring cross-check**

Auditor instructions for blind PA-05 sub-criterion validation. Scoring infrastructure.

---

### FILE 5: pa-guardrails-weaver.md (59 lines)

#### LEAVE: Entire File

**Classification: LEAVE — Weaver-specific compliance context**

This file contains:
- Tier 1 equivalent question enforcement (PA-17, PA-41 FAIL = verdict cap)
- Tier 5 provisional scoring notes
- Anti-pattern reference table (AP-02 through AP-13 with PA question mappings)
- Revision degradation warnings (multi-channel decoupling, density arc flattening, etc.)
- S-09 stacking check thresholds

All of this is compliance infrastructure. The revision degradation warnings (lines 39-48) have some generative value — they describe how fix cycles can unintentionally degrade composition — but they're framed as pipeline-specific risks, not general creative guidance.

---

### FILE 6: pa-manifest.md (89 lines)

#### LEAVE: Entire File

**Classification: LEAVE — per-run tracking template**

Run information fields, auditor report receipt checklist, PA-05 cross-validation status table, manifest completeness verification. Pure operational tracking with no generative content.

## CROSS-CUTTING OBSERVATIONS

### 1. The Pipeline PA Already Discovered the Generative Model — It Just Buried It

The experiential pass (Section 0) and the Weaver's experiential anchor are inhabitation. The Improvement Vector is creative direction. The feedback language protocol demands generative prose. The information isolation principle ensures fresh perception.

The pipeline then WRAPS these generative elements in 1,500+ lines of compliance machinery — 69 numbered questions, scoring matrices, threshold tables, anti-pattern taxonomies, cross-validation protocols. The generative PA skill should EXTRACT the core and DISCARD the wrapping.

### 2. The Question Count Problem

69 questions is too many for genuine perception. The pipeline deployed 9 auditors with 5-11 questions each — still a lot. The danger: question sets turn perception into task completion. "I need to answer PA-50, PA-51, PA-52, PA-53" becomes a checklist exercise, not an encounter with the page.

The generative skill should have at most 5-7 guiding prompts (not numbered questions), and they should be open-ended invitations to perceive, not yes/no checks to complete.

### 3. The Integrative Auditor Is the Template

The Integrative Auditor (no assigned questions, free-form gestalt impression) is the pipeline's accidental prototype for the generative auditor. It was added as a supplement to catch what the 9 specialized auditors missed. In the generative model, ALL auditors should work this way.

### 4. The Weaver's Best Work Is Creative Direction, Not Scoring

The Weaver produces 8 outputs. Of these, the Improvement Vector ("the page would come alive if...") and the Emotional Arc Synthesis are genuinely generative. PA-05 scoring, Tier 5 scoring, manifest verification, fix-type classification summary, and ship decision are compliance outputs. The generative skill's synthesizer should produce the generative outputs natively and skip the compliance outputs entirely.

### 5. Feedback Language Should Be the Default, Not a Translation

The pipeline generates compliance findings ("SC-09 FAILED: stacked gap 210px exceeds 120px") and then translates them to generative language ("The middle sags — energy dissipates by S5") for the IMPROVE builder. This two-step process is wasteful. The generative skill should produce generative language from the start.

### 6. Information Isolation Is More Important Than Question Design

The pipeline's information isolation principle (auditors never see build context, gate results, or each other's work) is more valuable than any individual question. A context-starved auditor with no questions at all will produce more genuine perception than a context-loaded auditor with perfectly designed questions. The generative skill should prioritize isolation over structure.

### 7. The 4 Emotional Registers Deserve Survival as Vocabulary

SURPRISE, DELIGHT, AUTHORITY, EARNED CLOSURE are useful perceptual categories. They describe real experiences that readers have. The pipeline quantifies them (1-10 scale, CSS signatures). The generative skill should use them as a reflective vocabulary — ways of naming what the page does to its reader — without scoring them.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SKILL REWRITE (Task #12)

1. **Make the experiential pass THE ENTIRE APPROACH.** Don't have it as "Section 0 before the real work." The inhabitation IS the real work. Auditors scroll, read, attempt to use the page, and write what they experienced. That's it.

2. **Preserve the visual verification instruction verbatim.** The "see pixels, don't decode text" instruction is the most operationally important single paragraph in the entire pipeline PA.

3. **Preserve information isolation as a structural principle.** Auditors receive only screenshots. No build context, no gate results, no other auditors' work, no pipeline vocabulary.

4. **Use ~5-7 open perception prompts instead of 69 numbered questions.** Draw inspiration from the experiential questions identified above (PA-01, PA-03, PA-11, PA-17, PA-20, PA-33, PA-45, PA-65, PA-76) but reframe as invitations to perceive.

5. **The synthesizer should produce creative direction, not scores.** Model after the Improvement Vector: "The page would come alive if..." Frame output as conviction and direction for the builder, not as a verdict.

6. **Keep the fix-type classification** (MECHANICAL/STRUCTURAL/COMPOSITIONAL) as a useful scale-of-change indicator in the creative direction output.

7. **Preserve the screenshot pre-capture pattern** as operational infrastructure. It's a solved problem.

8. **Use the 4 emotional registers** (SURPRISE, DELIGHT, AUTHORITY, EARNED CLOSURE) as reflection vocabulary in the synthesizer's creative direction, but without scoring.

9. **Deploy 3-7 independent auditors** (not 9+2) for artistic reflection. Each with the same open prompt. Multiple perspectives catch what single perspective misses — the breadth principle is real — but 9 specialized auditors is overkill for generative reflection.

10. **The feedback language protocol should be the ONLY language.** Never generate compliance language. Always speak in perceptual prose.

## Test 1: THE CHECKLIST TEST

> If you replaced this skill's brief output with a numbered checklist, would the builder's output change?

**VERDICT: PARTIAL PASS -- The Conviction Brief (Phase 4.5) passes cleanly; earlier phases do not.**

### What passes

The Conviction Brief format (Phase 4.5, lines 654-789) is the strongest section in the entire document. It is genuinely inseparable from content:

- **Section 1 (World-Description):** "In this world, knowledge compresses under pressure. The deeper you go, the denser and darker the material." -- You cannot checklist this. It requires the TC agent to have internalized a specific metaphor and describe how specific content inhabits a specific world. A checklist version ("State metaphor. State content type. State world properties.") would produce fundamentally different output.

- **Section 3 (Opposition Map):** "The content wants warmth and invitation. The world is austere. The opposition lives in the opening zone -- how does austerity invite?" -- This is a creative invitation framed as a question. A checklist ("List 3-5 tensions. State resolution.") would produce diagnostics, not invitations.

- **Section 4 (Compositional Arc):** "The shift from surface to mid-stratum should feel like stepping from a porch into a hallway" -- Experiential narrative. Cannot be checklisted without losing the felt quality that makes a builder want to create.

- **Section 5 (Creative Conditions):** "Try giving the digressions asymmetric margins -- indented left, full right -- so they feel like marginalia without being sidelined." -- Specific experimental invitations. A checklist version ("Include experimental techniques") would produce nothing.

### What fails

**Phase 1 (Multi-Axis Questioning, lines 94-173):** This IS a checklist. The Core Four table, Extended Core table, and Structural Trigger Axes table are lookup structures. The content says "always run" the core four, "always consider" the extended five, and "deploy conditionally" the triggers. This is compliance routing: scan input, match signals, deploy axis. The Opposition Principle (lines 138-148) tries to inject creative judgment ("which axes OPPOSE the system"), but it sits as an annotation on a fundamentally checklist structure.

Could you replace Phase 1 with a numbered checklist? YES. "1. Run FEEL axis. 2. Run UNDERSTAND axis. 3. Run DO axis. 4. Run BECOME axis. 5-9. Consider extended axes. 10-14. Check triggers." The builder's output would be nearly identical.

**Mitigation:** Phase 1 is a QUESTIONING phase, not an output phase. The checklist structure here serves as axis coverage insurance -- ensuring the TC agent doesn't forget to ask about navigation or trust. The creative work happens in the ANSWERS to these questions, not in the decision to ask them. So this is a checklist of PROMPTS, not a checklist of OUTCOMES. The distinction matters. I flag it but do not consider it blocking.

**Phase 2 Tension Derivation (lines 220-315):** The Addition Test, Three Criteria for Genuine/Cosmetic Tension, and Tension Spectrum are diagnostic instruments. These ARE checklistable: "1. Apply Addition Test. 2. Check three genuineness criteria. 3. Apply BECAUSE test. 4. Apply SUBSTITUTION test." But again, these are diagnostic tools applied to creative material -- they gate the quality of the creative output from Phase 1 rather than prescribing what to produce. Mixed verdict.

**Phase 3.5 Commitment Gate (lines 453-514):** The Commitment Verification (Step 3.5C) is a YES/NO checklist: "Did I derive independently? Can I justify without library? Does it appear in case studies?" This is compliance verification of the creative process. However, Step 3.5E (Creative Check: "Are you EXCITED about this metaphor?") breaks the compliance frame entirely. It asks for felt quality, not structural compliance.

**Phases 4.0-4.6 (Compositional Architecture, lines 517-651):** Heavy checklist energy. The 6 CSS channels, 5-category taxonomy, density patterns table, coherence transition table, fractal consistency table -- these are all systematic and could be replaced with numbered steps. The GOVERNING EVALUATION formula (line 522: `RICHNESS = SEMANTIC DENSITY x RESTRAINT x SPATIAL CONFIDENCE`) is genuinely generative -- it changes how a builder THINKS about composition. But the subsequent steps are procedural.

### Summary for Test 1

The skill has a clear split personality: **Phases 0-4.6 are procedural-diagnostic** (checklistable without major quality loss) while **Phase 4.5 (Conviction Brief) and Phase 4.7 (Reflection) are genuinely generative** (checklisting them would destroy quality). Since the Conviction Brief is the PRIMARY OUTPUT that downstream builders see, the checklist test passes for the output that matters most. But the TC agent's own process is still heavily proceduralized.

**Is this a problem?** Partially. The proceduralized phases constrain the TC agent's process, which is appropriate for some steps (axis coverage, tension validation) but may over-constrain others (metaphor search, compositional architecture). The tension between "ensure quality through process" and "enable creativity through invitation" is not fully resolved.

## Test 2: PHILOSOPHY BEFORE SPECIFICATION

> Does every instruction frame WHY before WHAT?

**VERDICT: STRONG PASS with 3 notable exceptions.**

### What passes brilliantly

- **Opening principle (lines 6-23):** "You are CONSTRUCTING a composition, not DISCOVERING one." WHY comes first, WHAT follows. The entire framing establishes epistemological stance before any procedure.

- **Library Access Prohibition (lines 77-91):** "Library patterns are VALIDATION tools, not GENERATION tools. Reading them before metaphor commitment = pattern-matching, not tension-deriving." WHY is explicit and convincing.

- **Phase 3 opening (lines 320-322):** "The tension is emotional; the bridge is structural." Philosophical principle BEFORE the procedure of extracting structural properties.

- **Conviction Brief framing (line 658):** "The Conviction Brief makes the builder want to create THIS page, not verify they haven't violated a checklist." Perfect WHY-before-WHAT.

- **Improve builder isolation (line 837):** "The answer is not 'fix the 6 defects' but 'compose deeper, knowing what was.'" Philosophical reframe before procedural specification.

### What fails

1. **Phase 0D (line 71):** "Every page runs the FULL pipeline" -- specification without philosophy. WHY does every page run the full pipeline? The parenthetical about "peak richness occurs at maximum content-mechanism fit" is the WHY, but it reads as a qualifier to the specification rather than as a grounding principle. Should lead with "Peak richness occurs at maximum content-mechanism fit, not maximum technique count. Therefore..."

2. **6 Binary Rejection Checks (lines 401-411):** Pure specification. The table presents rejection criteria without grounding WHY these specific 6 checks matter. R1 gets a WHY ("Zero interpretive distance. It's a label, not a bridge.") but R3-R6 give consequences rather than philosophical grounding. Compare to the Interpretive Distance section (lines 412-416) which does this well.

3. **Step 4.3 Coherence (lines 601-616):** "All channels must reinforce the same metaphor direction at each boundary" -- specification first. WHY multi-coherence matters (it's what separates "composed" from "formatted") appears at the end (line 611) rather than the beginning.

---

## Test 3: CONVICTION INSEPARABILITY

> Does the output format carry conviction that's inseparable from specific content? Or could the same brief template produce any page?

**VERDICT: PASS -- The template is strongly content-coupled.**

The Conviction Brief template (Sections 1-6) is structured so that generic completion is nearly impossible:

- **Section 1 requires:** "the metaphor as natural law of this world" + "the content's specific gravity in this world" + "the BECAUSE statement -- why THIS metaphor for THIS content." All three demand content-specific language.

- **Section 3 requires:** opposition stated as creative invitations about THIS content's tensions. The example ("The content wants warmth and invitation. The world is austere. The opposition lives in the opening zone -- how does austerity invite?") shows how the invitation is inseparable from specific content topology.

- **Section 4 requires:** experiential narrative ("The page opens wide and warm... At the mid-point, the content compresses... Two ideas need to live side by side"). The narrative voice REQUIRES knowledge of what the content actually says.

- **Section 6 (Content Map):** literally IS the specific content. Cannot be genericized.

**One concern:** Section 2 (Calibration) is the most genericizable. "Background arc: hex progression. Spatial arc: padding progression. Type arc: typography shifts." These could be filled with standard values regardless of content. The instruction to state ranges "anchored to this metaphor's needs" mitigates but doesn't eliminate this risk. A geological metaphor's calibration and an architectural metaphor's calibration could look identical in hex values.

**Overall:** The template is about 85% content-inseparable, 15% potentially generic (calibration + mechanical aspects of content map). This is a strong pass.

---

## Test 4: REFLECTION PROTOCOL

> Does the 6-dimension reflection enable the next window to GENERATE from it, not just comply with it? Could a builder receiving this reflection feel excited to create, or would they feel tasked to fix?

**VERDICT: PASS -- The strongest section in the entire document.**

The 6 dimensions (lines 797-821) are almost perfectly designed for generative handoff:

- **(a) CONVICTION:** "What I was AIMING AT -- the feeling I wanted the reader to have." Not what I built, not what the brief asked -- what I was reaching for. This gives the next builder a creative target, not a defect list.

- **(b) ALTERNATIVES:** "Creative paths not taken... they are not failures but DEFERRED possibilities." Explicitly frames unchosen paths as creative opportunities, not mistakes.

- **(c) SURPRISES:** "Visual relationships you didn't plan, rhythms that emerged." Directs attention to emergent quality -- the material the next builder can amplify.

- **(d) IMPULSES:** "Creative energy that was suppressed by constraints. Not complaints about the system -- genuine creative directions." Seeds for the next window. Explicitly NOT complaints.

- **(e) EXPERIENCE:** "Scroll through your page slowly. Describe what you experience. Don't evaluate -- describe." This is the masterstroke. It forbids diagnostic language and requires felt response.

- **(f) UNRESOLVED:** "Genuine competing compositional ideas where both options are valid. Not bugs or mistakes -- roads not taken that remain valid." Again, framed as creative opportunity.

**The Reflection Rules (lines 815-821) reinforce the generative frame:**
- "Written BEFORE audit" -- prevents contamination by diagnostic findings
- "Written as DIRECTION, not FINDINGS" -- explicitly separates from evaluation mode

**One minor flag:** Rule 4 specifies "Total length: 20-35 sentences across all 6 dimensions." This is a specification within a generative section. The sentence count is reasonable (it prevents both 3-sentence glossing and 100-sentence dumping), but the presence of a numeric constraint in a creative protocol introduces a compliance note. Not blocking.

---

## Test 5: EXPLORATION RECOMMENDATIONS

> Are they creative judgments (which explorations most productively FIGHT with this content?) or compliance judgments (which are "best")?

**VERDICT: STRONG PASS.**

Lines 767-787 explicitly frame exploration selection as GENERATIVE OPPOSITION:

- "Select by GENERATIVE OPPOSITION, not by similarity"
- "EXCLUDE the matching exploration. If your metaphor is geological, exclude the geological exploration. Loading the matching exploration encourages copying."
- "Which exploration solved a SIMILAR tension with a RADICALLY DIFFERENT approach?"
- "Explorations that FIGHT with the content's approach teach the builder what ELSE is possible."

This is genuinely creative judgment. The TC agent must understand the content's tensions deeply enough to identify what would productively CHALLENGE the builder's approach. A compliance version would say "Load the 3 highest-rated explorations" or "Load explorations that match the metaphor domain."

The 3-step selection protocol (exclude match, select by opposition, select by structural complement) is procedural but serves creative selection rather than compliance ranking.

---

## Test 6: COMPLIANCE LEAKS

> Has anything from the compression mindset leaked in? Scoring rubrics, threshold tables, boundary-keyed CSS, approved verb lists, mechanism counts as quality proxies?

**VERDICT: PARTIAL FAIL -- Several compliance leaks detected.**

### Detected leaks

1. **Mechanism count language (line 71):** "The natural landing zone is 16-18 mechanisms across all 5 categories, but count is a BYPRODUCT of multi-channel encoding, not a goal." The qualification is correct but the number (16-18) is still stated. This creates an implicit target. A TC agent reading "16-18 mechanisms" will unconsciously aim for that range. The subsequent sentence ("A page with 12 perfectly-deployed mechanisms that reinforce a coherent metaphor is richer than 18 forced ones") tries to dissolve the target but the number is already planted.

2. **Phase 1 axis count (line 136):** "The Phase 1 output table will have 4-14 entries depending on content richness." This frames the output in terms of count rather than quality. A generative framing would be "The output table has as many entries as the content genuinely demands."

3. **Isomorphism count (line 389):** "6+ is structurally deep. 2-3 is thin. 0-1 is decorative -- reject." This is a scoring rubric. It quantifies structural depth into a 3-tier scale. The reject threshold (0-1) is reasonable, but "6+ is structurally deep" creates a numeric target.

4. **Zone count specification (line 509):** "How many zones does the content naturally divide into? (3-5)" -- The parenthetical suggests a range that could become a compliance target. Better to let the content dictate without numeric suggestion.

5. **Brief length target (line 761):** "Target 80-120 lines." Reasonable constraint but still a numeric compliance target.

6. **Reflection sentence count (line 820):** "Total length: 20-35 sentences across all 6 dimensions." Same issue.

7. **Multi-coherence threshold (line 611):** ">=3 of 6 channels must shift simultaneously." The PRINCIPLE ("this is what separates composed from formatted") is generative but ">=3" is a compliance number.

8. **Transition type count (line 596):** "at least 3 DIFFERENT transition types between major sections." Principle is generative ("Uniform transitions create mechanical rhythm"), count is compliance.

### NOT leaks (correctly handled)

- **The personality spectrum (lines 203-211):** These percentages describe the design system's personality for tension derivation, not compliance targets. Correct use.

- **The 6 CSS channels (lines 535-543):** Vocabulary constraints (what the system CAN express), not compliance checklists. Correct framing.

- **Calibration ranges in the brief format (lines 683-688):** Content-specific ranges that inherently satisfy thresholds without stating them. Sophisticated architecture.

- **Binary Rejection Checks (lines 401-411):** These ARE compliance instruments, but they exist to reject metaphors that would produce known failure modes. Binary rejection is the correct application of compliance thinking.

### Overall for Test 6

The compliance leaks are present but mostly marginal. They appear as parenthetical numeric ranges rather than as primary framing. The dominant voice of the document is generative. The leaks are concentrated in Phases 0-4 (the TC agent's own process) rather than in Phase 4.5 (the builder-facing output), which means they affect the TC agent's mindset but do not contaminate the builder's experience.

## Test 7: STRUCTURAL RIGIDITY CHECK

> Does the skill correctly preserve physics (readability, contrast, container proportions) and identity (the sharp warm world) while framing them as conviction rather than compliance?

**VERDICT: PASS -- This is handled with sophistication.**

### Physics preservation

The skill embeds physics through multiple mechanisms:

- **Side B personality description (lines 188-199):** "Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved... Light is direct. Nothing floats." This is physics-as-worldbuilding. The container width ("Content lives within 940-960px. The spine holds.") is stated as a physical fact of the world, not a compliance rule.

- **The Soul Test (lines 213-218):** Five questions framed as diagnostic rather than prescriptive. "Does this look like it could appear in a magazine?" is a perceptual test, not a CSS specification.

- **Conviction Brief calibration (Section 2):** "The calibration ranges inherently satisfy perception thresholds without stating them." This is the correct architecture: embed constraints in specific values rather than stating the constraints themselves.

### Identity preservation

The sharp warm world is described in Section 1 of the brief format (lines 666-676) as world-description rather than rule-set. The instruction "Identity as the world the builder inhabits, not rules the builder obeys" (line 668) explicitly frames identity as conviction.

### One tension

The 6 Binary Rejection Checks (lines 401-411) frame physics as compliance (R3: "Does the metaphor's physical shape force container width below 940px?"). These are YES/NO compliance gates on the creative output. This is arguably the RIGHT framing for rejection checks -- they exist to catch metaphors that would violate physics -- but it creates a pocket of compliance within the creative process. Acceptable.

---

## Test 8: THE INVITATION TEST

> Would someone reading this skill feel INVITED to engage deeply with content, or TASKED with completing an assessment?

**VERDICT: MIXED -- Front-loaded invitation, procedure-heavy middle, strong invitation at output.**

### Feels like invitation

- **Opening principle (lines 6-23):** "You are CONSTRUCTING a composition, not DISCOVERING one." This is an invitation to creative agency. It tells the reader: your choices matter, your lens shapes the outcome.

- **The Opposition Principle (lines 138-148):** "The axes that produce the RICHEST tension are those whose demands OPPOSE the system's personality." This frames the work as discovering productive fights, not filling in a form.

- **Phase 3 (Metaphor Collapse):** "The irreducible creative step" (line 434) acknowledges that the pipeline cannot provide the metaphor, only constrain the search space. This respects the reader's creative capacity.

- **Step 3.5E Creative Check (lines 499-503):** "Are you EXCITED about this metaphor? Can you see the finished page in your mind?" -- Pure invitation.

- **The entire Conviction Brief format** -- invitation incarnate.

- **Phase 4.7 Reflection** -- invitation to describe experience, not evaluate output.

### Feels like task assignment

- **Phase 0 (Content Assessment, lines 42-91):** Step-by-step assessment protocol. "Read the content. Is it mostly prose? Mostly code/visuals?" -- This is triage, not invitation.

- **Phase 1 tables (lines 100-130):** Axis lookup tables. The format (column headers: Axis | Question | What It Produces | Richest When) is reference material, not creative engagement.

- **Phase 2 diagnostic tests (lines 220-315):** "Apply the Addition Test. Apply the BECAUSE test. Apply the SUBSTITUTION test." Sequential testing protocol.

- **Phases 4.0-4.6 (Compositional Architecture):** "Step 4.0, Step 4.1, Step 4.2..." -- Numbered sequential steps. The content of each step is often creative, but the FRAMING is procedural.

### The structural pattern

The skill has a sandwich structure: **INVITATION** (opening) -> **PROCEDURE** (Phases 0-4.6) -> **INVITATION** (Phases 4.5, 4.7). The procedure-heavy middle is where the TC agent does its analytical work. The invitation layers are where creative output is generated (brief) and creative state is captured (reflection).

Is this the right structure? Arguably yes: the TC agent needs procedural guidance for analysis (tension derivation IS analytical) and creative framing for output (the brief IS creative). The concern is whether the procedural middle suppresses the creative energy established by the opening. My assessment: moderately. The transition from "you are CONSTRUCTING" to "Step 0A: Content Type" is jarring. The creative framing established in the first 23 lines is not sustained through the diagnostic middle.

---

## Cross-Cutting Findings

### 1. The skill has two voices that don't fully integrate

Voice A (generative): "You are constructing, not discovering. Your lens shapes what you see. Are you excited about this metaphor?"

Voice B (procedural): "Step 0A. Apply the Addition Test. Check the three criteria. Fill in the transition table."

These voices alternate but never truly merge. The most successful sections are where both voices operate simultaneously -- e.g., the Metaphor Collapse (Phase 3) is procedural in structure but creative in content. The least successful are where Voice B operates alone -- e.g., Phase 0 (Content Assessment) and Phase 2 diagnostic tests.

### 2. The Conviction Brief is the document's crown jewel

Phase 4.5 is where the skill's philosophy becomes operational. The 6-section format, the creative authority statement, the "guardrails survive without explicit statement" architecture, the exploration recommendations by generative opposition -- this is a genuinely new way to hand off compositional intent. If I had to evaluate the skill on the brief format alone, it would be a clear pass across all 8 tests.

### 3. The Reflection Protocol is nearly flawless

Phase 4.7 achieves what it sets out to do: capture creative state in a form that enables generation, not compliance. The only concern is the sentence count constraint (20-35 sentences), which introduces a minor compliance note into an otherwise purely generative section.

### 4. Numeric leaks are present but not dominant

The document contains approximately 8 numeric specifications that could function as compliance targets (mechanism counts, axis counts, zone counts, line targets, sentence limits, channel shift minimums, transition type counts). None of these are the primary framing of their section, but they exist as parenthetical references that a compliance-oriented agent would seize on. The risk is that an agent reading this skill in a compressed or hurried context would extract the numbers and ignore the philosophy.

### 5. The opening principle is brilliant and undersustained

"You are CONSTRUCTING a composition, not DISCOVERING one" is the single strongest sentence in the document. It reframes the entire enterprise. But it appears once, at the top, and is never explicitly recalled during the procedural middle phases. Consider echoing this principle at key transition points (e.g., before Phase 3 metaphor search, before Phase 4 compositional architecture).

## Final Assessment

**Overall verdict: PASS with noted concerns.**

The skill successfully transforms from a compliance-oriented pipeline to a conviction-oriented one AT THE OUTPUT LAYER. The Conviction Brief and Reflection Protocol are genuinely generative documents that would produce materially different builder behavior than a checklist. The opening principle establishes the right creative frame.

The middle phases (0, 1, 2, 4.0-4.6) remain procedural. This is partially appropriate -- tension derivation and metaphor search require analytical rigor -- but the procedural framing occasionally suppresses the creative energy established by the opening. The numeric leaks (mechanism counts, axis counts, sentence limits) are minor but real.

**The critical question:** Does the TC agent's procedural middle produce a better or worse Conviction Brief than a purely generative middle would? I believe the procedural structure HELPS here -- it forces the TC agent to actually derive tension rather than pattern-match, which produces more content-specific briefs. The procedure serves the conviction. But it could serve it more gracefully with less checklist formatting and more sustained philosophical voice.

**Blocking issues:** None.

**Recommended improvements (non-blocking):**

1. Echo the "constructing, not discovering" principle at 2-3 key transition points in the procedural middle (before Phase 2 tension derivation, before Phase 3 metaphor search, before Phase 4 compositional architecture)
2. Reframe Phase 1 axis tables as "questions to inhabit" rather than "axes to deploy"
3. Remove or soften parenthetical numeric ranges (16-18 mechanisms, 4-14 entries, 3-5 zones, >=3 channels, 3+ transition types) -- let the content dictate counts, let the gate runner enforce minimums
4. Add one sentence to the Phase 4.0-4.6 transition that reconnects to the creative frame: "The architecture serves the metaphor. Every step below exists to make your metaphor VISIBLE, not to satisfy a rubric."
5. Lead Phase 0D with WHY before WHAT: "Peak richness occurs at maximum content-mechanism fit, not maximum technique count. Therefore, every page runs the full pipeline."
6. Move the multi-coherence WHY ("this is what separates composed from formatted") to BEFORE the specification (">=3 of 6 channels")

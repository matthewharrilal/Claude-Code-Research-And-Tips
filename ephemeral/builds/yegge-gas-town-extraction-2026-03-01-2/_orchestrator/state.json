Bento will serve the Processing Core (8 roles) in later chunks. (3) Width variation for pull quotes — considered narrowing Yegge's quotes to 60% width with margin-left offset, but decided full-width-within-container gives more authority to his voice. (4) Drop cap on the Yegge section opening — the Perimeter zone is diagnostic, not editorial; reserved drop-cap for the Intake zone's \"This is the fundamental shift\" paragraph where editorial authority serves destabilization.",

The next chunk needs to ramp significantly. (3) The control-panel component works for ASCII art but may need adaptation for the more complex role hierarchy diagrams in Section 3.",

    "Discovery 1: The conviction brief's opposition (INDUSTRIAL SCALE vs. INDIVIDUAL COMMAND) maps directly to CSS decisions: the comparison-table's asymmetric column styling embodies this tension visually — the \"Traditional Dev\" column is muted/receding (individual, fading), while the \"Gas Town\" column is warm/present (factory, arriving). The opposition lives in the background-color delta between table columns.",
    "Discovery 2: R5's \"First Component Rule\" (the first component sets section tone) became a structural decision: the Complexity Ladder as a dark control-panel hero is the FIRST visual after the header, and it immediately establishes the industrial/diagnostic tone. If the first element had been prose or a callout, the entire Perimeter zone would feel advisory rather than gatekeeping.",
    "Discovery 3: The transition grammar from CD-006 (Smooth/Bridge/Breathing) maps to the refinery metaphor's zone boundaries more precisely than expected. The Perimeter→Intake transition is genuinely a HARD CUT (different domain: credibility → conceptual disruption), while the You Are Here→Who is Yegge transition is a SPACING SHIFT (same domain: reader assessment, different intensity). The transition types aren't just spatial techniques — they encode how the reader's cognitive mode changes at each boundary, exactly as CD-F-025 predicted."

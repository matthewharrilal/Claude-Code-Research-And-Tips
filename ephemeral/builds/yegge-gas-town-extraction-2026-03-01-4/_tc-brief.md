## World-Description

This page lives in the part of the KortAI world where the geometry gets industrial. Where precision serves not elegance but *throughput*. The sharp edges here aren't editorial — they're structural steel. The warm earth tones carry soot. The red (#E83025) appears not for accent but for alarm: prerequisites you don't meet, costs you can't ignore, chaos you must accept. This is KortAI's factory district — same physics, different purpose.

## Opposition

The central tension is **anarchy versus architecture**. The content's soul is Mad Max — profane, chaotic, survival-focused, built from scavenged parts ("smuggled 400 miles upriver in my ass"). But its substance is deeply architectural — eight named roles in a strict hierarchy, a three-layer memory system, a dependency-tracking data plane backed by git. Yegge *talks* like a road warrior but *builds* like a systems engineer.

This tension is not a contradiction to resolve. It IS the content. The chaos is honest about what multi-agent orchestration actually feels like. The architecture is honest about what makes it work. A page that sanitizes the chaos betrays the content. A page that wallows in chaos obscures the engineering. The builder must hold both: the feeling of slopping fish into barrels AND the diagram of exactly where each barrel goes.

The secondary tension reinforces the first: **exclusion as invitation**. This document actively repels the unready ("you'll get your face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees") while simultaneously being the most thorough onboarding document imaginable. The gate is narrow. The room behind it is vast.

## Metaphor

The structural metaphor is the **refinery itself** — not as theme, but as spatial logic.

A refinery has three spatial zones: the **perimeter fence** (who gets in), the **processing floor** (where crude becomes product through staged transformation), and the **control room** (where you monitor, decide, and intervene).

The perimeter fence is the document's opening — the complexity ladder, the prerequisites checklist, the "If you have any doubt whatsoever, then you can't use it." This zone is deliberately narrow. It qualifies the reader before granting entry. Spatially, this is constrained width, high negative space, typographic authority. You are being assessed.

The processing floor is the document's core — the 8 roles, the Beads memory system, the communication flows. Crude input (your ideas) enters one end and finished product (working code) exits the other through staged transformation. Each role is a station on the floor. Spatially, this zone is the widest and densest. The 8 roles want horizontal breadth — stations side by side. The Beads memory model wants vertical depth — layers stacking down. The communication flow diagrams want directional movement — top to bottom, role to role.

The control room is the document's practical tail — implementation commands, health checks, troubleshooting, the decision matrix. This is where the overseer sits. Spatially, this zone returns to intimacy — terminal commands, checklists, if-then decisions. The width narrows again. The density becomes utilitarian.

The refinery metaphor governs transitions: you pass through the fence (qualification), enter the floor (understanding), and arrive at the controls (action). The density arc follows: LOW → HIGH → MEDIUM.

## Arc

**Opening (Perimeter Fence):** The reader feels *tested*. The complexity ladder places them. The prerequisites list confronts them. The feeling is: "This document knows I'm here and is deciding whether to let me in." Not hostile — respectful. The way a senior engineer respects your time by telling you upfront what's required.

**Authority Transfer (The Founder's Office):** The reader feels *trust building*. Yegge's credentials — Amazon, Google, a million lines vibe-coded — transfer conviction. The pull quotes hit: raw, profane, earned. The feeling shifts from "should I be here?" to "this person has been where I want to go."

**Revelation (The Factory Floor Gate):** The ant/colony insight. The reader feels the *click* — the mental model restructuring. "Everyone is focused on making their ant run longer... when nature prefers colonies." This is the page's emotional peak. Not the densest section, but the most transformative. The feeling is sudden clarity after disorientation.

**Architecture (The Processing Floor):** The reader feels *overwhelm resolving into order*. Eight roles sound like too many — then the hierarchy diagram makes them legible. Each role has a clear function, a model recommendation, a set of commands. The feeling is: "This is complex but not complicated." Dense, but navigable.

**Memory (The Vault):** The reader feels *relief*. The "50 First Dates" problem is named, which means it's solvable. Beads is the answer. Three memory layers — hot, warm, cold — make intuitive sense. The feeling is: "The hardest problem has a solution."

**Context (The Observatory):** The 6 Waves and 8 Stages provide *historical grounding*. The reader feels placed in a larger story. Gas Town isn't an experiment — it's the next stage of an evolution they're already on.

**Implementation (The Control Room):** The reader feels *grounded*. Terminal commands. Startup scripts. tmux layouts. The feeling shifts from conceptual to physical — fingers on keys.

**Decision (The Exit Gate):** The reader feels *honest self-assessment*. The "When to Use" section and comparison matrices are mirrors. The feeling is: "Now I know whether this is for me." Resolution without pressure.

## Content Map

**Zone 1 — The Perimeter Fence** (Sections: You Are Here, Who is Steve Yegge)
The complexity ladder is a vertical axis element — a literal ascending structure that should feel like looking up at something tall. Tight, constrained, high editorial authority. Instrument Serif for the ladder labels. The prerequisites checklist is a gate: checkboxes that feel consequential. Yegge's bio is a compact authority block — table-dense, quote-punctuated. Density: LOW spatial, HIGH semantic.

**Zone 2 — The Revelation** (Sections: The Gas Town Mental Model)
The ant/colony comparison is the page's fulcrum. This wants asymmetric layout — the "Traditional Approach" and "Gas Town Approach" side by side, the contrast doing the teaching. The "Idea Compiler" concept deserves pull-quote treatment. The Mad Max context is brief but grounding. Density: MEDIUM spatial, HIGH semantic. This zone breathes because the insight needs room to land.

**Zone 3 — The Processing Floor** (Sections: The 8 Roles Architecture, Beads: The Memory System)
This is the page's densest zone and its longest. The 8 roles hierarchy diagram is the centerpiece — a structural visualization that must feel like looking at a factory floor plan. Each role's deep dive is a station: function, responsibilities, commands, model recommendation. The communication flow diagram shows material moving through the factory. Beads follows as the floor's memory infrastructure — the three-layer model is a natural depth stack. Density: HIGH spatial, HIGH semantic, MEDIUM cognitive.

**Zone 4 — The Context Layer** (Sections: The 6 Waves of AI, Core Principles)
This zone provides altitude. The 6 Waves table is a timeline — horizontal movement through eras. The 8 Stages of Dev Evolution mirrors the opening ladder but at finer grain. Core Principles (GUPP, Zero Framework Cognition, Cattle Not Pets) are axioms — each wants Essence-level treatment. Density drops: MEDIUM spatial, HIGH semantic.

**Zone 5 — The Control Room** (Sections: Implementation Guide, Checkpoints, Troubleshooting)
Terminal commands dominate. tmux layout diagrams. Startup scripts. Checkpoint tables. Troubleshooting is problem→cause→recovery — a natural decision-tree structure. This zone is utilitarian and warm — it wants the reader to succeed. Density: MEDIUM-HIGH spati

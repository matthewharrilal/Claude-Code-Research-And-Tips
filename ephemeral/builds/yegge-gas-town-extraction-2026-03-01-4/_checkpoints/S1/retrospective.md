The artifact is a 185KB page whose refinery metaphor has crossed from theme into genuine spatial logic — zone backgrounds create felt atmospheric shifts as you scroll, the 2-zone dark-header/light-body DNA repeats at every structural scale to build unconscious legibility, and the gate component's repetition in both perimeter and console zones enacts the conviction brief's exclusion-as-invitation tension through structural position rather than editorial voice. R5's combination theory has become the artifact's deepest internalized grammar (velocity buffering between code blocks and checkpoints, temperature-driven sequencing, setup-payoff arcs governing entire zones), and R3's geological density is fully enacted in the memory model visualization, but both research strands thin out *within* sections — the processing floor's eight stations march at uniform density where R3's PULSE rhythm should create breathing, and DD-006's fractal self-similarity stops at two scales when four were promised, meaning a builder who zooms into any single zone finds steady rhythm rather than the dense/sparse alternation visible at page level. The most promising unclaimed territory is R5's component mood and voice register system — the Essence callout (Wise Archivist voice: "If you remember nothing else...") was defined in CSS but never deployed for the core principles and foundational insights where it would have been the natural instrument, and more broadly, the components speak in consistent structural rhythm but not yet in distinct emotional voices, which means the next subset's builders can deepen the page's felt intelligence by giving different component types genuinely different personalities rather than relying on the 2-zone DNA pattern to carry all the structural communication.

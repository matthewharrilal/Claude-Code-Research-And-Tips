DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Geological Density Strata → Memory Layers**\n\nThe memory model visualization in Section 04 is the single most deeply integrated moment on this page. R3's geological framework describes information forming layers with appropriate density at each depth — \"Surface\" through \"Bedrock.\" The builder translated this into the Beads memory model with border-weight encoding depth: Hot context gets the heaviest border (4px, red), Warm gets middle weight (3px, amber), Cold gets the thinnest (1px, gray). Simultaneously, the backgrounds darken as you descend — lightest for hot, medium for warm, darkest for cold. The retrieval bar at the bottom is fully dark (#1A1A1A), literally bedrock. This is not a reference to R3 — it IS R3, enacted. The builder read R3's Insight 24 (\"Users drill DOWN into density by choice\") and built a component where looking at it teaches you how it works. If you stripped out every comment and class name, you would still feel the depth gradient. That's integration.\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY — Component Sequencing and Velocity Management**\n\nThe builder internalized R5's velocity mismatch rule and temperature buffering throughout. In the Implementation Guide (Zone 5), every heavy code block is followed by a light checkpoint component — green-accented, compact, resolution-oriented. This is R5's \"Resolution Component\" principle in action: the code block creates cognitive weight, the checkpoint releases it. The pattern repeats five times in succession and never feels mechanical because the checkpoints carry genuine semantic content (\"You should see Town initialized at ~/.gt\"). Similarly, the transition from Core Principles (six consecutive principle cards — heavy, deliberate) into the Implementation Guide uses a bridge transition that carries semantic content: \"Principles understood. Now the commands.\" This is R5's \"Summary Bridge\" technique for density transitions, applied as a mode shift between abstract and concrete thinking.\n\n**Creative Direction — Refinery Metaphor as Spatial Logic, Not Theme**\n\nThe conviction brief demanded that the refinery metaphor govern spatial organization, not decoration. The builder honored this. The zone naming (perimeter, credentials, clearing, floor, vault, console) maps directly to the brief's three spatial zones (perimeter fence, processing floor, control room) but extends them with finer granularity. The backgrounds shift in a way that feels like physically moving through a building: the warm industrial tone of the perimeter (#F5EDE3) yields to the cleaner, airier clearing (#FEF9F5) for the revelation moment, then darkens significantly into the floor (#EDE5D8) where the dense processing happens, lightens slightly for the vault (#F8F3EB) — relief — then re-engages at the console (#FAF5ED). You feel the arc the brief described: tested → trusting → clicking → overwhelmed-resolving-into-order → relieved → grounded. The density arc (LOW → HIGH → MEDIUM) is structurally enacted, not just labeled.\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY — 2-Zone Component DNA at Multiple Scales**\n\nThe dark-header / light-body pattern (what R5 calls \"2-Zone Component DNA\" from Mechanism #2) repeats across every structural scale on this page: the stations have it, the principle cards have it, the hierarchy diagram's title bar has it, the memory layers' title has it, the tmux layout has it, the communication flow has it. This creates what the builder's comments call \"fractal self-similarity at component scale\" — and it works. You develop an unconscious expectation: dark bar on top means \"this is a bounded unit with a name and a body.\" The repetition doesn't feel monotonous because the content within the pattern varies (code commands vs. philosophical axioms vs. architectural diagrams), but the structural rhythm is consistent enough that you always know where you are.\n\n**Conviction Brief — The Exclusion-as-Invitation Tension**\n\nThe gate component appears twice — once in the perimeter fence (Section 0) and once in the console (Section 7). Same red left border, same consequential checkboxes, same warning treatment on the budget line. The first occurrence tests you. The second occurrence, appearing after you've absorbed 8 roles, a memory system, 6 waves, and 6 core principles, feels different — it feels like preparation rather than exclusion. The brief called this \"exclusion as invitation\" and the builder found the structural device to enact it: repeat the gate component, but in a different zone, where its emotional register has shifted because of everything between.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**DD-006-fractal — Self-Similarity Acknowledged but Not Fully Enacted**\n\nThe builder's CSS comments reference \"fractal self-similarity\" and \"fractal at component scale\" repeatedly, and the 2-zone DNA pattern does repeat across scales. But DD-006's core insight is deeper: \"the SAME RHYTHM VISIBLE AT EVERY ZOOM LEVEL\" — meaning dense/sparse alternation should be visible at page level, section level, component level, AND character level simultaneously. The page achieves this at page level (zones alternate dense/sparse) and component level (dark header / light body). But within sections, the pacing is relatively uniform. The stations in the processing floor, for instance, are all the same density — there's no inhale/exhale between station 3 (Dogs) and station 4 (Refinery). They march. DD-006 would say: zoom into the processing floor and the rhythm should still be visible there. It isn't quite. The fractal vocabulary appears in comments but the fractal experience stops at two scales instead of the four DD-006 demonstrates.\n\n**R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS — Bento Grid Claimed but Not Achieved**\n\nThe hierarchy diagram's comments reference \"Bento-like overview → variable sizing signals importance,\" but the actual grid is uniform — three equal columns for town-level roles, three equal columns for rig-level roles. A true bento grid would use variable cell sizes to encode importance (the Mayor cell should be larger than the Deacon cell, per R4's \"large = primary, small = secondary\" principle). The builder chose structural clarity over visual hierarchy encoding. This isn't wrong — the hierarchy works — but the bento claim in the comments overstates the integration.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Temporal Density Rhythm Patterns**\n\nR3 describes four specific rhythm patterns (PULSE, CRESCENDO, BOOKENDS, WAVE) and the conviction brief explicitly maps the page to a specific density arc. The builder achieves the overall arc through zone background shifts, but the within-zone temporal density — how information unfolds as you scroll through a single section — is relatively uniform. The processing floor (Zone 3) is the longest zone, and R3's PULSE pattern (HIGH-LOW-HIGH-LOW cycles) would suggest internal breathing within it. The stations provide structural rhythm but not density rhythm — each station is approximately the same weight, creating a plateau rather than a wave.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY — Component Mood and Voice Register**\n\nR5 establishes that components have moods (Gotcha = Urgent/Protective, Tip = Friendly/Encouraging, Essence = Reverent/Contemplative) and voices (\"Stop. This matters.\" vs. \"Between us, I've found...\"). The page uses callouts correctly — the Gotcha callout for the \"superintelligent chimpanzees\" warning, the Tip callout for the implementation section's warm closing. But the mood system isn't deeply leveraged. The Essence callout, which R5 describes as having the Wise Archivist voice (\"If you remember nothing else...\"), appears only once (in the callout CSS definitions) and is never deployed in the HTML. For content about core principles and foundational insights, the Essence voice would have been the natural choice. The principle cards use their own custom component instead. This is a missed re",

DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**The refinery metaphor as spatial architecture, not theme.**\nThe conviction brief describes three spatial zones — perimeter fence, processing floor, control room — and says the metaphor should govern \"not as theme, but as spatial logic.\" The builder absorbed this. The CSS custom properties name zones by concept (`--zone-perimeter`, `--zone-credentials`, `--zone-clearing`, `--zone-floor`, `--zone-vault`, `--zone-console`), and each carries a distinct background warmth that shifts at boundaries. Perimeter is grittier (#F5EDE3, 245/237/227), clearing is the lightest (#FEF9F5, 254/249/245). These aren't decorative swatches — they create actual atmospheric difference as you scroll. I can feel the room changing. This comes from R3's zone background differentiation mechanism but is applied through the conviction brief's refinery vocabulary. The builder didn't just read R3 — they read it *through* the brief.\n\n**The complexity ladder as constrained vertical authority.**\nThe conviction brief says: \"a vertical axis element — a literal ascending structure that should feel like looking up at something tall. Tight, constrained, high editorial authority. Instrument Serif for the ladder labels.\" The builder constrained the ladder to 640px within the 960px container, creating generous negative space on both sides. Instrument Serif italic appears on ladder names. The active rung breaks the pattern with a 4px red border and warm alarm tint (#FEF5F4), while standard rungs use 3px subtle borders. This is R3's dense/sparse alternation at component scale AND R5's border-weight gradient encoding hierarchy. You feel the active rung — it interrupts the rhythm the way R5 says pattern-breaking creates focal points. The faded Level 0 rung at the bottom feels distant and past. This is structural influence, not surface reference.\n\n**The paradigm shift comparison as contrast-driven teaching.**\nThe conviction brief says the ant/colony comparison wants \"asymmetric layout — the 'Traditional Approach' and 'Gas Town Approach' side by side, the contrast doing the teaching.\" The builder made the old approach column heavier (#F0E8DC, earthier, literally darker soil tones) while the new approach is cleaner and lighter. The old way FEELS like the past — not through labeling but through visual weight. The `↓` connectors between steps create vertical momentum within each column. The last step in each column is bolded, creating a resolution moment. This is R5's setup-payoff arc operating within a single component. Someone who hadn't read R5's principle about \"functional contrast\" creating \"harmony when it fulfills complementary roles\" would not have made the old column feel heavy and the new column feel clean — they'd have made them look the same with different text.\n\n**Zone 2's breathing space around the fulcrum quote.**\nThe conviction brief says the ant/colony insight is \"the page's emotional peak\" and \"This zone breathes because the insight needs room to land.\" The builder gave Zone 2 explicit extra spacing — `padding-top: var(--space-20)` (80px) at the zone entrance, and the fulcrum pull quote gets `margin-top: var(--space-10); margin-bottom: var(--space-10)` (40px each side). This is R3's density debt principle: the most semantically dense moment on the page gets the most generous whitespace around it. The effect is real — after the compressed gate and status grid of Zone 1, the revelation zone opens up and you feel the pressure release. The \"click\" moment the brief describes has room to happen.\n\n**The gate component as consequential checkpoint.**\nThe brief says \"checkboxes that feel consequential.\" The gate has a red 4px left border (alarm signaling), a labeled header zone in mono uppercase with warm tint background, and actual checkbox-shaped elements. The budget line ($50-200/day) gets warning treatment with bold weight and a red-bordered checkbox. This is R5's \"Cold\" temperature for Gotcha-style components applied to a custom element. The red left border comes from the conviction brief's instruction that red appears \"not for accent but for alarm: prerequisites you don't meet, costs you can't ignore.\" The builder read that line and built the gate to feel like a genuine barrier.\n\n**R5's combination sequencing within Zone 2.**\nThe revelation zone follows: pull quote (principle) → paradigm shift (proof through contrast) → data table (grounding comparison) → pull quote (reinforcement) → idea compiler block (concrete synthesis) → reason list (contextual anchoring). This maps to R5's S1 Setup-Payoff Arc: Context → Map → Principle → Demonstration → Action. No component type repeats without a different component type intervening. The reading velocity shifts between slow components (pull quotes, comparison grid) and medium components (data table, reason list), following R5's velocity mismatch rule. This is sequencing discipline that requires having read the combination theory, not just having good instincts.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**R4's reading pattern labels.** The CSS comments reference \"F-pattern for left-aligned scanning\" on the TOC and various axis patterns by name, but the TOC is a two-column grid — not a distinctly F-pattern layout. The builder knows the R4 vocabulary and applies it as annotation, but the actual layout decisions don't feel distinctly shaped by reading pattern theory. The TOC works fine, but it would work fine without R4 knowledge. The axis pattern references feel like knowledge-display rather than structural influence.\n\n**DD-006's fractal self-similarity.** The spacing scale includes the four-tier compression (80px → 32px → 16px → 4px) and border weights use a three-tier gradient (4px/3px/1px) — both DD-006 mechanisms. But the fractal principle — the SAME rhythm visible at EVERY zoom level — isn't clearly operating. Page-level density alternation exists (Zone 1 compressed, Zone 2 breathing). Section-level exists too (tight ladder, then open status grid, then tight gate). But component-level self-similarity isn't visible — the callout components don't show internal dense/sparse alternation in a way that mirrors the page rhythm. The mechanisms are present; the metaphor isn't applied.\n\n**R3's temporal density patterns.** The comments mention PULSE and CRESCENDO, and the conviction brief describes a density arc (LOW → HIGH → MEDIUM), but with only two of five zones visible, the temporal rhythm is incomplete and impossible to fully feel. What exists feels like the beginning of a CRESCENDO (LOW perimeter → MEDIUM revelation → presumably HIGH floor), but it's a partial impression. The annotations exceed the demonstrated rhythm.\n\n**The \"factory district\" vocabulary.** The CSS root comment says \"same physics, different purpose\" and references the conviction brief's \"industrial\" framing, but the zone backgrounds are soft creams and warm earth tones. The dark header and red accents carry industrial weight, but once you enter the body content, the atmosphere is more \"warm study\" than \"factory floor.\" The vocabulary of soot and structural steel appears in comments but doesn't fully translate to felt experience.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**The \"exclusion as invitation\" tension — relevant and missing.** The conviction brief describes a secondary tension: the document \"actively repels the unready\" while being \"the most thorough onboarding document imaginable.\" The gate component provides the structure for exclusion, but the *feeling* of being assessed is muted. The content extraction includes the devastating quote \"If you have any doubt whatsoever, then you can't use it\" and the warning about getting \"your face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees.\" Neither appears in the perimeter zone. The gate exists as a checklist, not as a confrontation. The brief says \"Not hostile — respectful. The way a senior engineer respects your time by telling you upfront w",

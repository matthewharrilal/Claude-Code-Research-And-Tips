  "result": "The 8 Roles Architecture section (Zone 3: Processing Floor) has been built and inserted into the artifact. Here's my creative reflection:\n\n---\n\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: Zone 3 — the Processing Floor — as the page's densest zone. Three structural components: (1) a designed HTML hierarchy diagram replacing the ASCII art with a 4px-bordered floor plan showing three tiers (Town/Rig/Human) connected by mono-font arrows, (2) 8 station cards grouped by tier in grid layouts (3-column for Town, 2-column for Rig, full-width for Human), each following identical 2-zone DNA (dark header with role number/name, light body with function/responsibilities/commands/model), and (3) a vertical communication flow diagram showing material moving from Overseer through Mayor, Refinery, Workers, Dogs to Completion. Background shifts from clearing (#FEF9F5) to floor (#EDE5D8) — a 66 RGB delta jump signaled by breathing transition (3px border). Model recommendations use color-coded badges (red Opus, blue Sonnet, green Haiku) giving the role grid a secondary visual layer. Floor-zone code blocks are compressed (smaller padding, smaller font) to match the zone's industrial density. Stations use the same repeating structure at every position — fractal self-similarity at component scale.\n\nTRYING: To hold the conviction brief's \"overwhelm resolving into order\" arc. Eight roles SHOULD feel like too many at first — then the hierarchy diagram makes them legible before you encounter any detail. The 3→2×2→1 grid progression (Town→Rig→Overseer) creates a visual funnel that mirrors the actual hierarchy: many coordinators above, fewer workers below, one human at the base. The station's rigid repeating structure is deliberate — by the third station, the reader has internalized the pattern and can scan rather than read. The communication flow at the end serves as proof: all 8 roles working together on a single task, the factory assembled.\n\nREJECTED: (1) ASCII pre blocks for both diagrams — the conviction brief explicitly rejects this for the complexity ladder, and the hierarchy diagram deserves the same designed treatment. (2) Full-width stations for all 8 roles — this would make the section impossibly long and defeat the \"factory floor plan\" spatial feel. The grid groupings create the side-by-side station effect the brief requests. (3) Adding callouts or prose not in the source content — the section's density comes from the data itself (8×{function, responsibilities, commands, model}), not from editorial commentary. (4) Using serif font for role names in the hierarchy diagram — mono uppercase feels more industrial/mechanical, matching the factory district atmosphere. Serif is reserved for the station headings where editorial authority is needed. (5) Bento-style large/small cell variation in the station grids — equal-sized stations better serve the repeating pattern rhythm that creates legibility.\n\nSURPRISED: The model-badge color coding creates an unexpected visual rhythm across the station grid. Opus (red) appears on Mayor and Refinery — the decision-makers. Sonnet (blue) on Dogs and Polecat — the workers who need reasoning. Haiku (green) on Deacon, Witness, Crew — the lightweight watchers and disposables. Without planning it, the badge colors map to role importance: red=strategic, blue=tactical, green=operational. This is R5's \"confidence encoding via color\" operating through the content's own logic, not through design intent. Also surprised that the breathing transition from clearing to floor — that 66 RGB delta jump — feels less dramatic than expected. The 3px border does the cognitive work of signaling \"new zone,\" while the background shift creates atmosphere rather than shock. The previous builder's \"Unresolved\" concern about this transition being too dramatic turns out to be unfounded — the shift is dramatic but earned after the revelation zone's generous whitespace.\n\nWANTED: A sticky scroll witness (Mechanism #8) to track which role you're viewing — with 8 stations, positional awareness matters. But the section isn't long enough within the single viewport to justify sticky navigation, and the tier group labels already provide landmarks. Also wanted to give the communication flow diagram horizontal branches (Witness observing laterally, status reports flowing back up) but the vertical-only design is cleaner and more honest about what the reader needs to understand: the primary path, not the side channels.\n\nUNRESOLVED: The floor zone's compressed callout treatment (5px border, tighter padding from `.zone--floor .callout`) is defined but never triggered in this chunk — the 8 Roles section contains no callouts. This treatment will matter in chunks 3-4 when Beads and Implementation sections bring callouts into the floor zone. Also unresolved: whether the Overseer's pull quote should use the standard `.pull-quote` treatment or something more intimate, given that it's the moment the document directly addresses the reader (\"That's you, Human\"). The current standard treatment works but doesn't fully capture the shift from third-person description to second-person direct address.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: Grid column count can encode organizational hierarchy. 3-column (Town level) → 2-column (Rig level) → 1-column (Human level) creates a visual funnel that mirrors the actual command structure. The narrowing isn't arbitrary layout — it IS the hierarchy, expressed spatially. R4's bento grid insight (\"cell size signals importance\") extends to column count signaling organizational breadth.\n- Discovery 2: The repeating station structure achieves the conviction brief's \"overwhelm resolving into order\" NOT through progressive disclosure or animation, but through pattern recognition. By the third station (Dogs), the reader has learned the station template and shifts from reading to scanning. The rhythm is the resolution. This connects R3's \"density rhythm patterns\" with R5's \"repeating pattern creates rhythm\" in a way neither research stream articulated alone: identical structure at high frequency makes density manageable, while identical structure at low frequency makes density monotonous.\n- Discovery 3: Model recommendation badges (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) function as an unplanned information layer that maps directly to the hierarchy. Strategic roles (Mayor, Refinery) → Opus (most expensive, red badge). Tactical roles (Dogs, Polecat) → Sonnet (mid-tier, blue badge). Operational roles (Deacon, Witness, Crew) → Haiku (cheapest, green badge). The cost hierarchy and the role hierarchy are the same hierarchy, expressed through R5's \"confidence encoding via color\" mechanism. The content was already encoding this — the design just made it visible.\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

  "result": "All key content preserved including profanity, quotes, and terminology.\n\n---\n\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: Three-zone page architecture (perimeter/credentials/clearing) with concept-based CSS custom properties. Designed the Complexity Ladder as a vertical stack component with 4px/3px/1px border-weight gradient encoding the active level. Created the Prerequisites Gate as a red-bordered checkpoint component. Built the Paradigm Shift comparison as a two-column layout with asymmetric visual weight — old approach on earthy #F0E8DC (muted past), new approach on clean #FAFAF8 (open future). Deployed the Idea Compiler as a structured input/output component bridging the pull quote to concrete mechanics. Zone backgrounds progress: #F5EDE3 (industrial warmth) → #FAF5ED (trust building) → #FEF9F5 (clean breathing) with RGB deltas of 23 and 16 respectively — both above the 15-unit perceptual floor.\n\nTRYING: To hold the anarchy/architecture opposition at every level. The pull quotes with their profanity and red borders carry the chaos. The data tables, gate checkboxes, and structured ladder carry the engineering. Neither dominates. The zone progression tells the emotional arc: tested (perimeter) → trusting (credentials) → illuminated (clearing). The Paradigm Shift comparison deliberately makes the old way feel heavier/earthier and the new way cleaner — the contrast teaches before the reader finishes reading.\n\nREJECTED: (1) Using a `<pre>` code block for the Complexity Ladder — the brief explicitly calls for \"a literal ascending structure that should feel like looking up at something tall,\" which demands designed HTML, not monospace ASCII. (2) Theming the CSS with explicit Mad Max vocabulary (`.wasteland`, `.war-rig`) — the refinery metaphor is spatial logic, not decoration. (3) Making the Traditional/Gas Town comparison equal visual weight — the brief says \"asymmetric layout\" and the whole point is that the new approach is where the energy lives. (4) Softening the prerequisites with friendly language — the gate should feel consequential, not welcoming.\n\nSURPRISED: The zone backgrounds tell a story I didn't fully plan. The perimeter (#F5EDE3) has actual visual soot — it's warm but gritty. When the page transitions to the credentials zone (#FAF5ED), the lightening feels like stepping inside from a dusty yard. And the clearing (#FEF9F5) for the revelation section opens up like entering an atrium. The backgrounds ARE the emotional arc even without reading the text. Also surprised by how naturally the Complexity Ladder works as a designed component — the left border creates a continuous vertical rail, and the active rung's 4px red border genuinely draws the eye upward.\n\nWANTED: A sticky TOC or scroll witness to track position through the full page (Mechanism #8), but this chunk only covers the opening sections — it would feel premature. Also wanted to use the solid offset depth technique (Mechanism #3) on the fulcrum quote (\"world's biggest fuckin' ant\") to give it physical weight, but it felt like competing with the red border for attention. Restraint won.\n\nUNRESOLVED: The density arc for this chunk is LOW → COMPACT → BREATHING. When the processing floor (8 Roles Architecture) arrives in chunk 2, the density needs to spike dramatically — the zone-floor background (#EDE5D8) is ready but the transition from #FEF9F5 to #EDE5D8 is a 66 RGB delta jump. That's dramatic by design, but the transition mechanism (breathing type? bridge type?) needs to signal the shift convincingly. Also unresolved: how the 8-role hierarchy diagram will interact with the constrained 960px container — it wants to feel wide like a factory floor plan but the spine doesn't stretch.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: Zone background progression can encode emotional arc independently of content. The F5EDE3 → FAF5ED → FEF9F5 gradient maps directly to tested → trusting → illuminated, and this is felt even when squinting at the page. R3's \"zone background differentiation\" mechanism isn't just categorical — it's narrative when deployed as a gradient across zones.\n- Discovery 2: The Paradigm Shift comparison revealed that asymmetry doesn't require different column widths — it requires different visual *weight*. The old approach on #F0E8DC (heavier, earthier) versus the new on #FAFAF8 (lighter, cleaner) creates the asymmetry the brief demands while maintaining structural symmetry. This connects R4's \"bento grid\" thinking (size = importance) with R5's \"temperature\" model (warm/cold) in a way I hadn't planned.\n- Discovery 3: The conviction brief's \"exclusion as invitation\" tension maps directly to the Gate component's design. The red left border and warning-styled budget item don't repel — they *respect*. The CSS encoding (4px red border = alarm) is the same mechanism used for Gotcha callouts, but in the gate context it becomes \"we take your readiness seriously.\" Same mechanism, different semantic register. R5's observation that components have \"moods\" applies even to custom components not in the original catalog.\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

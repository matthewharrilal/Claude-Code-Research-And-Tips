Now I have a thorough visual understanding of all three viewports. Let me compose my audit report.

# Auditor D: Flow + Pacing

## 0. Experiential Pass

**Desktop (1440px):** The page opens with a dark, authoritative header that immediately sets industrial tone. The eye drops into a warm-toned TOC, then encounters the Complexity Ladder — a strong vertical element that anchors orientation. Scrolling through the credentials section feels compact and earned. Then the background lightens dramatically for the "Revelation" section (Gas Town Mental Model), creating genuine breathing room — the paradigm shift comparison and pull quotes land with weight. The transition into the 8 Roles section is the page's most dramatic moment: the background darkens noticeably, and a dense grid of station cards with dark header bars creates a visual wall of industrial density. This zone is long and heavy. Relief arrives with the Beads vault section (lighter background), then the observatory zones provide altitude. The Implementation Guide plunges into code-heavy territory — long dark code blocks dominate, and the troubleshooting failure cards stack tightly. Bridge transitions with centered italic text provide brief cognitive respites. The quotes section stacks ~13 pull quotes which starts to feel repetitive. Comparison tables bring analytical density. The page closes with tags, metadata, a centered closing quote with red bar, and a dark footer that mirrors the header — a clearly designed ending.

**Tablet (768px):** Flow is preserved. Grids collapse to single-column, which makes station cards and comparison tables stack vertically. The page gets significantly longer. The TOC goes single-column. The density rhythm still reads, but the code blocks occupy more relative screen real estate.

**Mobile (375px):** The page is extremely long. Station cards, comparison tables, and code blocks all stack single-column. Pull quotes shrink gracefully. The hierarchy diagram roles stack vertically. The essential flow — warm opening, breathing revelation, dense floor, code console, reflective exit — still tracks, though the sheer length creates more fatigue.

## Question Responses

### PA-12: Do your eyes flow smoothly from section to section?

**Assessment:** YES, with one exception.

**Evidence (desktop 1440px screenshot):** Scanning top to bottom, the eye moves through a clear progression of zone backgrounds — warm tan (perimeter) → slightly warmer (credentials) → lightest cream (clearing/revelation) → noticeably darker tan (processing floor) → medium warm (vault) → light cream (observatory) → warm (console) → light cream (exit gate) → dark tan (comparison) → warm (sources) → light cream (closing) → dark footer. Each boundary is marked by either a subtle 1px border (within-zone smooth transitions) or a heavier 3px border with background shift (cross-zone breathing transitions). The eye is never confused about where one section ends and the next begins.

**The exception:** In the console zone (Implementation Guide through Troubleshooting, roughly the middle-to-lower third of the desktop screenshot), there is a very long unbroken stretch of dark code blocks stacked in close succession. The eye encounters dark rectangle after dark rectangle — startup script, daily workflow, health checks, quality verification, recovery commands — and the rhythm flattens. The flow doesn't break, but it thickens to a point where individual sections within this zone blur together.

**Severity:** MINOR — the code-heavy stretch is the one area where flow becomes sluggish.

### PA-13: Is there a clear visual ending, or does the page just stop?

**Assessment:** YES — the page has a clearly designed ending.

**Evidence (desktop 1440px screenshot, bottom ~5%):** The page's final visible elements are: (1) a tag cloud of small bordered badges on a light cream background, (2) a "Document Metadata" block with dark header bar and key-value grid mirroring the station card structure used throughout, (3) a centered closing quote in Instrument Serif italic — "Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant" — with a red 48px horizontal bar centered below it, and (4) a dark footer that mirrors the header exactly: dark background, 3px red top border, monospace meta text, and a small red rule. The closing quote echoes the page's opening epigraph and the green pull quote from Section 11, creating a bookend structure.

**Evidence (tablet 768px screenshot, bottom):** Same elements visible, footer stacks vertically (text centered, red rule hidden). The closing quote and red bar remain prominent.

**Evidence (mobile 375px screenshot, bottom):** Same structure, all elements present and legible. The centered closing quote scales down but retains its visual weight.

**Severity:** NONE — this is a strong, designed conclusion.

### PA-34: Pick a transition between two major sections. Is it a DESIGNED moment or just empty space?

**Assessment:** YES — the transition from Revelation (Section 02, Gas Town Mental Model) to Processing Floor (Section 03, 8 Roles Architecture) is a DESIGNED moment.

**Evidence (desktop 1440px screenshot, roughly 25-27% from top):** At this boundary, I see: (1) the background shifts from the lightest cream tone to a distinctly darker, warmer tan — a visible color change of meaningful magnitude, (2) a 3px structural border line appears at the boundary, (3) the vertical padding above "Section 03 · Processing Floor" is generous, signaling a new zone, (4) the section meta text changes from "Section 02 · Revelation" to "Section 03 · Processing Floor," and (5) immediately below the section title, the Hierarchy diagram appears — a component with a dark full-width title bar ("GAS TOWN ROLE HIERARCHY") that creates a strong visual anchor. This is not empty space; it is a multi-channel transition where background color, border weight, spacing, and content density all shift together.

**Severity:** NONE — this is well-executed.

### PA-35: Scroll at reading speed. Does interest stay level, peak and valley, or fade? Where do you start skimming?

**Assessment:** CONDITIONAL — The page has a clear peak-and-valley rhythm, but interest fades in two specific stretches.

**Evidence (desktop 1440px screenshot, full scroll):**

- **Opening through Revelation (~top 25%):** Interest builds steadily. The Complexity Ladder, prerequisites gate, credentials table, and paradigm shift comparison each introduce new visual patterns. The pull quotes punctuate with editorial voice. The revelation zone's extra breathing room creates a genuine emotional peak — the "ant colony" quote lands with visual weight in open space.

- **Processing Floor (~25-45%):** Density peaks. The hierarchy diagram is visually striking. Station cards introduce a repeating dark-header/light-body rhythm across 3-column and 2-column grids. Interest stays high through novelty of the role descriptions. The communication flow diagram provides a visual capstone.

- **Vault through Observatory (~45-63%):** Memory layers and principle cards sustain interest with new component types. The wave table with its highlighted row is an effective visual marker.

- **Console zone — CODE FATIGUE (~63-78%):** This is where skimming begins. The Implementation Guide, Checkpoints, and Troubleshooting sections present an unbroken wall of dark code blocks. Looking at the desktop screenshot in this region, I count approximately 12-15 dark code rectangles with relatively small amounts of body text between them. The failure cards (6 in sequence) each contain code blocks, so the visual pattern is: dark header bar, small text, dark code block, dark header bar, small text, dark code block — repeated six times. The eye starts scanning for the next non-code element.

- **Exit Gate through Quotes (~78-85%):** Interest recovers briefly with the decision flow diagram (a new visual elemen

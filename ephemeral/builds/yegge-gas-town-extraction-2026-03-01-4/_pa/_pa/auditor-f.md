Excellent. Now I have all five questions. Let me do my experiential pass and then answer each one carefully, referencing the screenshots.

# Auditor F: Consistency + Rhythm

## 0. Experiential Pass

**Desktop (1440px):** The page opens with a dark header carrying a red bottom border, then flows into a warm beige table of contents zone. A complexity ladder with a highlighted red rung anchors the first content section. The page moves through zones with subtly shifting warm backgrounds — beige tones getting lighter and darker in a wave pattern. Station cards with dark headers repeat in 3-column and 2-column grids. A dense middle section of dark code blocks dominates the implementation zone. Pull quotes with red left borders recur throughout. Comparison tables stack in the lower third. The page closes with tags, metadata, and a centered closing quote mirroring the header's voice. The overall rhythm alternates between light content zones and dark embedded elements (code blocks, station headers, hierarchy diagrams).

**Tablet (768px):** Grids collapse to single columns. Station cards stack vertically. The TOC becomes a single column. The paradigm-shift comparison stacks vertically. The general rhythm holds — zone backgrounds shift consistently, and the alternation between light zones and dark embedded blocks persists. Spacing feels slightly tighter.

**Mobile (375px):** Further compression. The header title shrinks. All multi-column layouts are single-column. The complexity ladder loses its right-side tag. Code blocks remain dark and full-width. Pull quotes maintain their red left borders. The vertical rhythm of zone-to-zone shifts remains perceptible even at this narrow width.

## Question Responses

### PA-16: "Pick two elements that should look identical. Do they?"

**Elements chosen: Station cards (Role Deep Dives — Mayor, Deacon, Dogs, Refinery, Polecat, Witness, Crew)**

Looking at the desktop screenshot, the Town Level tier shows three station cards side by side. Each has: a dark header bar with a number and italic name in light text, then a light body below with section labels, bullet lists, a dark code block, and a model badge at the bottom. Visually scanning across Mayor, Deacon, and Dogs — the dark header bars appear the same height and darkness. The body areas use the same background warmth. The monospaced section labels ("RESPONSIBILITIES", "COMMANDS") appear in the same size and weight across all three.

Moving down to the Rig Level tier (Refinery, Polecat, Witness, Crew in a 2-column grid), the same structure repeats: dark header, light body, same section labels, code blocks, model badges. The visual weight of each card's header is consistent. The code blocks inside each station are the same dark tone with the same text size.

**One deviation noted:** The Overseer station (Role 08) intentionally breaks the pattern — it has a red border instead of the standard gray, and is full-width. This reads as deliberate emphasis on the human role, not inconsistency.

**Also checked: Failure cards (Troubleshooting section).** These follow the same 2-zone DNA as station cards: dark header with number + italic name, light body with field labels. Scanning the desktop screenshot, all six failure cards maintain identical structure — header height, label positioning, field grid alignment all match.

**Also checked: Pull quotes.** Across the page, pull quotes consistently show a red left border, warm pink background tint, and italic serif text. The one exception is the green-bordered closing pull quote in the Quotes section and the blue-bordered quote in the Comparison section — these are intentional semantic color shifts (green = resolution, blue = external voice).

**Assessment:** YES — elements that should look identical do look identical. The repeating components (stations, failure cards, pull quotes, callouts, data tables) maintain consistent visual treatment throughout.

**Severity:** NONE

**Evidence:** [1440/desktop — mid-page station card grid area; 1440/desktop — lower troubleshooting failure card area]

### PA-17: "Is there a visual rhythm (like a beat in music), or random? TIER 1 EQUIVALENT"

**Assessment:** YES — there is a clear, perceptible visual rhythm.

Looking at the full desktop screenshot from top to bottom, I can identify a deliberate density wave:

1. **Dark header** (dense, dark) → **warm TOC** (medium, light) → **Perimeter zone** (medium density, ladder + gate) — the opening establishes the beat.

2. **Credentials zone** (compact table + quotes, warm background) → **Clearing zone** (spacious, lighter background, the paradigm shift comparison has generous vertical breathing) — density drops at the "revelation" moment.

3. **Floor zone** (background darkens noticeably to a warmer/darker beige; the hierarchy diagram, station card grids, and communication flow create the densest section) — this is the page's heaviest passage.

4. **Vault zone** (slightly lighter background than floor; memory layers diagram, architecture diagram — still dense but more focused) → **Clearing zone again** (6 Waves tables, then Core Principles — density eases, background lightens).

5. **Bridge transition** (a centered italic line on a different background — visible as a distinct horizontal bar) → **Console zone** (code-heavy, dark blocks dominate — density rises again for implementation).

6. **Another bridge** → **Clearing** (quotes section — spacious, pull quotes stack with breathing room) → **Floor** (comparison tables — dense again) → **Console** (sources, reference cards) → **Clearing** (closing tags, metadata, centered quote).

The beat is: **light → medium → heavy → relief → heavy → relief → closing exhale.** This is not random — it follows a deliberate arc with the heaviest density in the middle third (Processing Floor) and resolution in the final third.

The alternation of dark embedded elements (code blocks, station headers, hierarchy title bars) within lighter zone backgrounds creates a secondary rhythm — a pulse of dark-on-light that repeats consistently.

**Severity:** NONE

**Evidence:** [1440/desktop — full page scroll showing zone background shifts from warm beige to darker beige to light cream and back; 768/tablet — same pattern visible in narrower layout]

### PA-41: "Are any visual patterns repeated 4+ times without variation? Purpose or monotony? TIER 1 EQUIVALENT"

**Assessment:** CONDITIONAL — patterns repeat 4+ times, but with PURPOSE, not monotony. However, one area warrants scrutiny.

**Patterns repeated 4+ times:**

1. **Station cards** — 8 instances (7 standard + 1 overseer variant). The 7 standard stations repeat the identical dark-header/light-body structure. This reads as purposeful: each is a "station" in a factory, and the repetition creates the feeling of walking past workstations on a factory floor. The Overseer variant (red border, full-width) provides meaningful relief.

2. **Pull quotes** — 14+ instances across the page. Each has a red left border, warm pink background, italic serif text. In the Quotes section (Section 11), pull quotes stack with only a heading break between groups. Looking at the desktop screenshot in that region, I count approximately 13 pull quotes with minimal variation. Two quotes break the red pattern (one green, one blue), which provides slight relief. However, the stacking of 3-4 identical red pull quotes in sequence within each sub-headed group does begin to feel monotonous — the eye loses its place because each block looks the same.

3. **Failure cards** — 6 instances with identical structure. This feels purposeful: a reference section where uniformity aids scanning.

4. **Data tables** — 7+ instances. Consistent 3px border, mono headers, same cell padding. Purposeful for scanability.

5. **Code blocks** — 10+ dark blocks. These repeat without variation in visual tr

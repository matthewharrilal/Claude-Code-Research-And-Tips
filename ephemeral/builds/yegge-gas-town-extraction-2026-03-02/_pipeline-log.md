  - Reflection: PASS — 29 lines, exists
- **Concerns:** None — all 3 passes produced valid HTML, monotonic size increase
- **Cumulative cost estimate:** $30-38 (Phase 3 est: $15-18)

## Phase 4: EVALUATE — Checkpoint

- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-02T02:00
- **Agents spawned:** 6 (5 PA auditors + 1 weaver — all Opus)
- **Artifacts produced:**
  - _screenshots/1440-full.png — 2.9MB
  - _screenshots/1440-fold.png — 87KB
  - _screenshots/1024-full.png — 2.8MB
  - _screenshots/1024-fold.png — 84KB
  - _screenshots/768-full.png — 2.7MB
  - _screenshots/768-fold.png — 82KB
  - _pa/auditor-1.md — 77 lines
  - _pa/auditor-2.md — 75 lines
  - _pa/auditor-3.md — 88 lines
  - _pa/auditor-4.md — 87 lines
  - _pa/auditor-5.md — 46 lines
  - _pa/synthesis.md — 234 lines
  - _comparison-report.md — extracted from synthesis.md Output 4
- **Quality floor check:**
  - Screenshots: PASS — all 6 files > 50KB, no blank captures
  - All 5 auditors: PASS — all produced substantive reports
  - Weaver synthesis: PASS — 234 lines, all 4 outputs present (Experience Portrait, Creative Direction, Verdict, Package Compliance)
  - Comparison report: PASS — extracted from Output 4
- **Verdict:** REFINE
  - 5 issues classified: 3 TYPE A (code block monotony, spacing uniformity, whitespace voids), 2 TYPE B (weak decompression after Beads, bottom-third energy fade)
  - All 5 auditors converged on dark code block uniformity as the dominant perceptual issue
- **Package compliance:** 5/9 sections followed, 4/9 partial, 0/9 not followed
  - NOVEL instructions: 16/20 followed
  - STANDARD instructions: 7/7 followed
  - Highest-impact gap: code block uniformity overwhelming velocity interleaving
- **Concerns:** The content's ~30 code blocks stress-tested the velocity interleaving budget beyond design capacity. Fix cycle needs content-level restructuring, not just CSS adjustment.
- **Cumulative cost estimate:** $40-48 (Phase 4 est: $10-12)
- **Decision:** PROCEED TO PHASE 5 — Verdict is REFINE, not REBUILD. Issues are fixable.

- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-02T03:30
- **Fix cycles completed:** 1
- **Fix type:** Mixed TYPE A (mechanical) + TYPE B (structural)
- **Agents spawned:** 7 (1 refine builder + 5 PA auditors + 1 weaver — all Opus)
- **Artifacts produced:**
  - _fixes/fix-1-page.html — 3,072 lines (111KB)
  - _fixes/fix-1-feedback.md — fix documentation
  - _pa/auditor-1.md — 92 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/auditor-2.md — 112 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/auditor-3.md — 93 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/auditor-4.md — 102 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/auditor-5.md — 93 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/synthesis.md — 255 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _comparison-report.md — updated with post-fix compliance
  - Screenshots re-captured at 1440/1024/768px (all 6 validated)
- **Quality floor check:**
  - Fix page: PASS — 3,072 lines, 111KB, style block, Google Fonts, self-contained
  - All 5 re-evaluation auditors: PASS — substantive reports
  - Weaver synthesis: PASS — all 4 outputs present
- **Re-evaluation verdict:** SHIP
  - Pre-fix issues resolved: 4/5 fully, 1/5 partially
  - Package compliance: 9/9 sections followed (up from 5/9 pre-fix)
  - NOVEL: 15/15 (up from 16/20 pre-fix, normalized tracking)
  - STANDARD: 7/7 (unchanged)
  - Remaining concern: code block frequency (diminishing returns)
- **Concerns:** None — Weaver explicitly recommends shipping
- **Cumulative cost estimate:** $56-64 (Phase 5 est: $16-20)
- **Decision:** PIPELINE COMPLETE — SHIP verdict achieved after 1 fix cycle

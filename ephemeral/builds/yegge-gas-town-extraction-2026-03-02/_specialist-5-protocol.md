## Consumption Protocol

The builder receives a merged research package. This protocol defines the sequence for absorbing it -- not just WHAT to read first, but WHY that ordering produces better CSS.

1. **READ** soul checklist (Package Section 0) -- Establish the hard boundaries.
   The builder must know what is IMPOSSIBLE before knowing what is desired. Soul constraints are physics, not preferences. For this Gas Town page: border-radius: 0 means the industrial control tower has angular geometry. box-shadow: none means the tower's floors are flat planes, not floating cards. These constraints shape every CSS property the builder writes. If the builder reads the metaphor first, they may imagine rounded corners for "warm" human floors -- the soul says no.

2. **INTERNALIZE** the conviction brief (Package Section 1) -- Absorb the metaphor before the tools.
   Read the TC brief's World-Description first: the industrial control tower with warm human surface and dark bedrock. Let the metaphor shape perception BEFORE reading mechanism selections. If mechanisms are read first, the builder composes FROM tools ("I have Typography Compression, where do I apply it?"). If the metaphor is read first, the builder composes FROM conviction ("the Overseer's floor needs warm generous spacing -- what mechanism achieves this?"). For Gas Town, the 4 oppositions (Chaos vs Precision, Warmth vs Hierarchy, Mastery vs Gate-keeping, Solo vs Collective) establish the TENSIONS that drive CSS decisions.

3. **STUDY** mechanism selections (Package Section 2) -- Not a shopping list.
   Each mechanism was selected FOR this content and this metaphor. Read the rationale column. The builder needs to understand WHY a particular density pattern was chosen for an article about multi-agent orchestration hierarchy -- not just THAT it was chosen. The mechanisms serve the metaphor: if the brief calls for a density arc from warm cream (Overseer floor) through dense white (Town level) to dark bedrock (Beads memory), the density mechanisms must encode that vertical descent.

4. **MAP** content to zones using the zone architecture (Package Section 4) -- Assign before building.
   The TC brief's compositional arc defines creative waypoints: the Factory Metaphor Section, the Beads Memory Model dark zone, the 6 Waves Table, the Decision Matrix resolution. Map these to spatial zones with explicit pixel-level spacing BEFORE writing any CSS. The content map (Section 6 of the brief) lists 14 sections with register annotations, word counts, and structural features. The builder should sketch the full page arc: which sections compress (8 Roles Architecture at 40-48px), which sections breathe (opening at 64-80px), where the dark zone falls (Beads at ~55-65% height).

5. **DEPLOY** findings zone-by-zone (Package Section 3) -- Apply research to specific zones.
   Each finding becomes a CSS instruction only when attached to a specific zone. A finding like "tight tracking signals authority" becomes actionable only when the builder knows WHERE authority lives in this content (the Overseer declaration, the role hierarchy labels). Deploy per-zone, not per-finding. For Gas Town: blockquote findings deploy to Yegge's voice zones, code block findings deploy to the Implementation Guide section, table findings deploy to the 8 Roles and comparison sections.

6. **INTEGRATE** case study patterns (Package Section 5) -- Weave proven CSS into zones.
   Case studies provide proven CSS implementations. The builder reads them AFTER zone mapping so they serve the plan rather than dictating it. The key is divergence: if a case study's pattern matches the current metaphor too closely, question it. The control tower metaphor is specific to Gas Town -- borrowed patterns must be adapted, not copied.

7. **VERIFY** against anti-patterns (Package Section 6) -- Defensive check before shipping.
   Read the anti-pattern table LAST because it is a checklist, not a creative input. For Gas Town, the highest-risk anti-patterns are: uniform floor-plate repetition (8 roles as 8 identical cards), whitespace void between dense sections (the 8 Roles to Beads transition), and code wall (the Implementation Guide has 6+ code blocks). Each anti-pattern has a mitigation specific to THIS content.

8. **TEST** structural propositions (Package Section 8) -- Does the build embody the hypotheses?
   The brief's creative waypoints are testable propositions: Does the Beads Memory Model section feel like the deepest floor? Does the Decision Matrix feel like returning to the Overseer's warm surface? Does the density gradient encode the tower's vertical descent? These tests come last because they require the build to exist before they can be evaluated.

## Agent-0C Effective Patterns

### Pattern 1: Invariant 8-Section Template Structure

All 6 packages share an identical 8-section skeleton: (0) Soul Checklist, (1) Common References, (2) Your Combination, (3) Components To Use, (4) R-5 Findings To Test, (5) Density Pattern, (6) Structural Constraints, (7) Anti-Patterns To Avoid, (8) Scoring Criteria. The ordering encodes a cognitive logic: constraints first (0-1), creative direction second (2-3), research application third (4-5), defensive checks fourth (6-7), success criteria last (8). This ordering IS the consumption protocol -- Section 0 before Section 2 is non-negotiable because constraints precede creative direction.

**Why effective:** The builder does not need to decide WHAT to read. The template decides. Every builder gets the same cognitive scaffolding regardless of content complexity.

**Recommendation for synthesizer:** Preserve this section ordering in the merged package. The 10-section structure of the new tripod package should map to Agent-0C's cognitive logic: boundaries first, then conviction, then mechanisms, then zones, then findings, then anti-patterns.

### Pattern 2: Recipe Format with Sequenced Verbs

Agent-0C used recipe verbs throughout: "Place Tip or Info callout between Code and Reasoning blocks" (cd-001 Section 3), "Use the Setup-Payoff Arc" (cd-002 Section 3), "Start with Info Callout to set philosophical treatise tone" (cd-004 Section 4). These are sequenced imperative actions (Place, Use, Start, Follow, Insert, Buffer), not compliance checks (Verify, Must be, Fail if).

**Why effective:** Recipe format produces richer creative output than checklist format. This was confirmed in the Flagship Retrospective: the Middle builder got a 100-line RECIPE and produced richer work; the Flagship builder got a 71-line CHECKLIST and produced compliant but flat work. The verb type determines the builder's cognitive mode -- "Place a Tip Callout after every heavy component" activates spatial reasoning, while "Verify Tip Callout exists after heavy component" activates compliance checking.

**Recommendation for synthesizer:** Every instruction to the builder should use a recipe verb (READ, PLACE, USE, DEPLOY, INSERT, BUFFER, MAP, START). Zero compliance verbs (VERIFY, ENSURE, MUST, FAIL IF) in the builder-facing sections. Compliance verbs are reserved for the PA, not the builder.

### Pattern 3: ASCII Density Diagrams

Each package included a content-specific ASCII diagram in Section 5: CRESCENDO (`LOW .... / MED ........ / HIGH ............#### / PEAK ################`), PULSE (`DENSE ####    #### / SPARSE    ....    ....`), ISLANDS (`OCEAN ....    .... / ISLAND    ####    ####`), TIDAL (`NARROW ===    === / WIDE    =========`), FRACTAL (5-scale description). Each diagram was followed by pixel-level breathing zone specifications.

**Why effective:** Builders are visual-spatial thinkers implementing visual-spatial artifacts. The ASCII diagram transfers the SHAPE of the density arc faster than prose. It encodes two variables simultaneously: vertical position (scroll progression) and horizontal width (information density). The diagram for Gas Town should map the tower's vertical descent: generous spacing at the Overseer floor, compression through the 8 Roles, maximum density at Beads, release at the Decision Matrix.

**Recommendation for synthesizer:** Include a content-specific ASCII density diagram in the zone architecture section. The diagram should map THIS content's 14 sections to density registers, with pixel-level spacing between each zone transition. The diagram is NOT generic -- it reflects the conviction brief's compositional arc.

### Pattern 4: Component Tables with Role/Weight/Velocity Per-Page

Every package included a component table with 4 columns: Component | Role in This Page | Weight | Velocity. The "Role in This Page" column was the key differentiator -- it connected each component to THIS content's specific need, not a generic description. cd-001: "Code Snippet | Primary content -- implementation examples | Heavy | Slow." cd-006: "Essence Callout | Ambient -- philosophical background voice | Light | Fast." The role column told the builder WHY this component was selected for THIS page.

**Why effective:** The role column prevents generic component deployment. Without it, a builder treats the component table as a shopping list. With it, the builder understands that Code Snippet in cd-001 is the PAYLOAD (primary content) while in cd-006 it is SUPPORTING (examples within a larger structure). For Gas Town, the builder needs to know that blockquotes carry Yegge's voice (PERSONALITY payload, not generic emphasis), code blocks carry tmux/bash scripts (OPERATIONAL manual, not tutorial), and tables carry role comparisons (STRUCTURAL architecture, not data display).

**Recommendation for synthesizer:** The component/mechanism table must include a "Role in This Page" column with Gas Town-specific descriptions. Every mechanism selected must explain its role FOR the control tower metaphor and the 14-section content structure.

### Pattern 5: Risk-Profiled Anti-Patterns Per Content Type

Section 7 in every package rated each anti-pattern as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/ZERO TOLERANCE specifically for THIS page's content and component mix. cd-001 rated "Code Wall" as HIGH because it had 3 heavy components; cd-003 rated "Callout Cacophony" as HIGHEST because it had 4 callout types. The risk level was not generic -- it was derived from the specific component selection and content structure.

**Why effective:** Generic anti-pattern lists produce generic compliance. Content-specific risk profiles focus the builder's defensive attention on the actual threats. For Gas Town, the real risks are: uniform role cards (8 roles = 8 identical treatments -- HIGH), code wall in Implementation Guide (6+ code blocks -- HIGH), whitespace void between Beads dark zone and the following section (MEDIUM), and callout cacophony in the Quotes section (10+ blockquotes -- MEDIUM). A generic anti-pattern list would weight these equally; a risk-profiled list tells the builder where to concentrate defensive energy.

**Recommendation for synthesizer:** Include a risk-profiled anti-pattern table with Gas Town-specific ratings. The rating must derive from the content map's structural features (how many code blocks, how many tables, how many blockquotes per section) and the metaphor's known risks (the brief's risk profile warns about uniform floor-plate repetition).

### Pattern 6: Per-Builder Customization (Scaling What Varies)

Across the 6 packages, what SCALED: component count (5 in cd-001 to 11 in cd-006), R-5 findings tested (11 in cd-001 to all 39 in cd-006), anti-pattern risk ratings, density diagram specifics, scoring targets (35-37 for cd-001 to 39-40 for cd-006), and extra sections (cd-006 got Section 0.5 Crown Jewel Status and Section 8 Wave 2 Note). What stayed CONSTANT: the 8-section template, the soul checklist, the 4 combination rules, the transition grammar matrix, the structural constraints. The invariant scaffold carried the variable payload.

**Why effective:** The constant template means every builder knows where to find information. The variable payload means each builder gets only what THEY need. cd-001's builder did not need 39 R-5 findings; cd-006's builder needed all of them. For the tripod pipeline's single builder, the package should be calibrated to THIS content's complexity -- Gas Town is a prose-heavy article with high structural complexity (14 sections, 6+ ASCII diagrams, 8 role descriptions, multiple code blocks), warranting a high-investment package closer to cd-006 than cd-001.

**Recommendation for synthesizer:** Calibrate the research package to Gas Town's structural complexity. The content map shows ~4,500 words across 14 sections with high structural variety (tables, ASCII diagrams, code blocks, blockquotes, bullet lists). This is a high-complexity page that warrants comprehensive mechanism selection, detailed zone architecture, and full anti-pattern profiling.

### Pattern 7: Compatibility Notes from the 11x11 Matrix

Each package included a compatibility notes table showing specific component pairs relevant to THIS builder's assignment, rated from the master 11x11 matrix: "Code + Reasoning | Yes | Excellent -- code provokes reasoning" (cd-001), "Task + Decision Matrix | Yes | Excellent -- action + options" (cd-002). The matrix relationships were made actionable by pairing them with specific placement advice.

**Why effective:** The full 11x11 matrix has 55 unique pairs. No builder needs all 55. Agent-0C extracted only the pairs relevant to each builder's component selection, then added actionable notes. For Gas Town, the relevant pairs are those involving blockquotes, tables, code blocks, and ASCII diagrams within the control tower's tiered floor structure.

**Recommendation for synthesizer:** If mechanism or component pairings are relevant to this page, include only the pairs that apply to Gas Town's specific content mix. Annotate each pairing with placement advice tied to the zone architecture.

## Anti-Orphaning Principle

Every CSS property in the final HTML must trace back to an identifiable source in the research package. Orphan CSS -- properties that exist without research backing -- breaks the comparison chain that the PA uses to evaluate the build.

**ANTI-ORPHANING: Before writing any CSS rule, identify its source:**
- **Finding ID** (e.g., "TC Brief Section 2: background arc specifies #1A1A1A for Beads/Memory core")
- **Mechanism name** (e.g., "Typography Compression from mechanisms.md applied to role hierarchy labels")
- **Soul constraint** (e.g., "border-radius: 0 from identity.md -- all tower floors have sharp edges")
- **Conviction brief direction** (e.g., "4px left-border in editorial red for Yegge's foundational declarations, from TC Section 5 Invitation 1")
- **Content structure** (e.g., "3-tier border system 4px/3px/1px from TC Section 1: town-level/rig-level/worker-level roles")

**If a CSS rule has no identifiable source, question whether it belongs.** The builder may still write it -- creative autonomy is preserved -- but the rule should be annotated as BUILDER-ORIGINATED so the PA can evaluate it on its merits rather than flagging it as a gap.

**Traceability format for the builder:**
```css
/* SOURCE: TC-Brief §2 background arc — Beads/Memory bedrock */
.beads-section { background: #1A1A1A; }

/* SOURCE: identity.md — sharp edges command authority */
.role-card { border-radius: 0; }

/* SOURCE: BUILDER-ORIGINATED — visual breathing between role tiers */
.tier-divider { margin: 48px 0; }
```

This traceability enables Phase 4's comparison report: what the package instructed (source), what the builder did (CSS), what the PA found (evaluation). Without it, the comparison has blind spots.

## Template Recommendation for Synthesizer

The synthesizer merges 5 specialist outputs into a single research package. Based on Agent-0C's 8-section structure and the tripod pipeline's 3-file architecture, the 10 sections should be organized as follows:

**Package Structure (single file, ~200-300 lines):**

| Section | Content | Source Specialist |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 0 | Soul Checklist | Specialist 5 (protocol) + identity.md |
| 1 | Build Context: Metaphor + Content Map | Specialist 1 (TC brief) + Specialist 2 (content) |
| 2 | Mechanism Selections with Rationale | Specialist 3 (mechanisms) |
| 3 | Component/Mechanism Table (Role in This Page) | Specialist 3 + Specialist 2 |
| 4 | Zone Architecture with ASCII Density Diagram | Specialist 4 (creative) + Specialist 2 (content map) |
| 5 | Findings Deployed Per-Zone | Specialist 2 (findings) + Specialist 4 (zone assignments) |
| 6 | Case Study CSS References | Specialist 3 (mechanisms) + case-studies/ |
| 7 | Anti-Patterns Risk-Profiled for Gas Town | Specialist 5 (protocol) + Specialist 2 (content risks) |
| 8 | Consumption Protocol (this document's Section 1) | Specialist 5 |
| 9 | Creative Conditions + Experimental Questions | Specialist 1 (TC brief) + Specialist 4 (invitations) |

**Ordering rationale:** Sections 0-1 establish boundaries and conviction. Sections 2-3 provide tools. Sections 4-5 map tools to content. Sections 6-7 provide reference and defense. Sections 8-9 provide process and creative permission. The builder reads 0-5 before building, consults 6-7 during building, and tests against 8-9 after building.

**Anti-orphaning integration:** The synthesizer should include the traceability format in Section 8 and reference it in Sections 2-5 (every mechanism selection, finding deployment, and zone specification is a potential CSS source that the builder should cite).

  - yegge-gas-town-extraction.md (~1,280 lines) -- content markdown
  - _tc-brief.md (155 lines) -- conviction brief
  - MASTER-AD-EXECUTION-SPEC.md (~1,407 lines, skimmed for protocol sections) -- Layer 7
  - MASTER-CD-EXECUTION-PROMPT.md (930 lines) -- Layer 7
  - research-package-cd-001.md (249 lines) -- Layer 8 bookend (simplest)

  - research-package-cd-004.md (250 lines) -- variation patterns
  - research-package-cd-005.md (226 lines) -- variation patterns
- **Decisions made:**
  - Focused on MASTER-CD-EXECUTION-PROMPT.md's Section 0 (Preamble) and Section 1 (Mandatory Reads) for the consumption protocol -- these showed the "context before content" pattern most clearly
  - Read cd-001 and cd-006 in full as structural bookends before skimming cd-002 through cd-005 for variation patterns (per prompt's reading strategy)
  - Identified 7 effective patterns (exceeded minimum of 5) because the exemplars yielded distinct structural patterns at each section
  - Anchored consumption protocol on Gas Town's specific content: 14 sections, industrial control tower metaphor, 4 oppositions, 3 density registers, tiered role hierarchy
  - Classified Gas Town as high-complexity (closer to cd-006 than cd-001) based on content map structural features
  - Content is prose-heavy with high structural variety -- component vocabulary shifts toward typography, spacing, zone mechanisms, blockquote treatment, and tiered visual hierarchy rather than pure structural components
- **Output size:** 119 lines
- **Quality self-assessment:** MEETS -- Consumption protocol has 8 sequenced steps with rationale anchored on THIS content. 7 Agent-0C patterns identified with effectiveness rationale and synthesizer recommendations. Anti-orphaning principle stated with traceability format and CSS comment examples. Template recommendation maps 10 sections to specialist sources. Gas Town and control tower metaphor referenced throughout. Recipe verbs used exclusively in builder-facing protocol (READ, INTERNALIZE, STUDY, MAP, DEPLOY, INTEGRATE, VERIFY, TEST).

## Summary

- **Sections fully followed:** 9/9 (Sections 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- **Sections partially followed:** 0/9
- **Sections not followed:** 0/9

**NOVEL instructions followed:** 15/15

**Pre-fix → Post-fix improvement:**
- Sections followed: 5/9 → 9/9
- NOVEL compliance: 16/20 → 15/15 (normalized tracking)
- Issues resolved: 4 of 5 pre-fix issues fully resolved, 1 partially resolved

**Highest-impact remaining gap:** Code block FREQUENCY in middle zones. Package addressed adjacency and uniformity; remaining concern is total exhibit count per zone. Diagnosed as PACKAGE UNCLEAR, not builder divergence.

**Fix cycle innovations:** `.code-minor` class (24 of 37 blocks lighter), Zone 4 zone-opener (2rem + 1.85 line-height), register bridge restoration (24px → 40px), Zone 6 bookend symmetry (64px → 80px), PULSE width contrast (90%/60%).

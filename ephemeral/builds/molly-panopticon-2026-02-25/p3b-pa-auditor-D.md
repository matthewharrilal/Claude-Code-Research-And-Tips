## 0. Experiential Pass

I scrolled through the entire page as a first-time reader. Here is what I experienced:

**Opening (Header):** A dark, near-black background with red label text ("DEEP EXTRACTION -- YEGGE-LEVEL") and a large serif title in off-white. Metadata row beneath with red label words and gray values. Strong, confident entrance -- the dark band says "this is serious." [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png]

**Table of Contents:** Transition to a warm cream panel with a red/orange left-border accent and the heading "CONTENTS -- THE WATCHTOWER" in red small-caps. Sixteen chapters listed in two columns with small numbering. The watchtower metaphor is introduced here -- you are looking out over the landscape of this content. [screenshots/zones/toc.png]

**Zone 1 (Philosophy):** The cream background continues. Long-form prose with clear subheadings in bold italic serif. Two distinct callout styles appear: one labeled "THE ASYMMETRY" with a warm rose tint and red header text, and a blockquote with a purple/violet left-border and italic text attributed to Molly Cantillon. A second callout later with an amber/orange "ESSENCE" header. The reading experience is comfortable -- generous line spacing, unhurried paragraphs, roughly 60-70 characters per line. [screenshots/zones/z1-philosophy.png, screenshots/1440/scroll-02.png, screenshots/1440/scroll-03.png]

**Zone 1-to-Zone 2 Transition:** A bold red/orange horizontal rule spans the full width. Below it the zone label changes to "ZONE 2 -- THE SIGHT LINES -- ARCHITECTURE" and the background shifts to a noticeably warmer, more tan/khaki tone. This is the most well-signaled transition on the page. [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png]

**Zone 2 (Architecture):** Warmer background with dark code blocks (near-black with colored syntax highlighting), two-column info cards for domain descriptions (headed "CORE DOMAINS" and "LIFE DOMAINS" with orange labels), and small principle cards in a 2x2 grid with colored headers ("PRINCIPLE 1: CLEAR BOUNDARIES" etc.). Visually denser -- more structured, more contained elements. [screenshots/zones/z2-architecture.png]

**Zone 3 (Implementation):** Dense implementation content continuing on the warmer background. Multiple code blocks with colored terminal text on dark backgrounds. A tabular layout for "Production Automations by Domain." A "SIGNAL ANALYSIS" callout with a rose/coral tint. The reading pace slows here because the visual rhythm becomes repetitive: prose, code block, prose, code block. [screenshots/zones/z3-implementation.png]

**Zone 4 (Philosophical Pivot + Warnings):** A striking full-width dark banner with large italic serif text: "I panopticon still, but the tower belongs to you -- so still a prison?" with two small labels below. This is the single most memorable visual moment on the page. Following it: three side-by-side dark cards showing domain-specific CLAUDE.md examples with colored syntax text. Then anti-patterns in a 2x2 card grid with orange headers and symptom/fix structure. [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png]

**Zone 5 (Workshop):** "Building Your Own Panopticon" -- numbered phases with code blocks and checkpoint bars marked by green/sage left-borders. Phase structure (Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Ongoing) provides clear temporal progression. A "CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT" callout with an orange header near the end. [screenshots/zones/z5-workshop.png]

**Zone 6 (Synthesis + Footer):** Key quotes in paired cards with colored headers ("ON SELF-LEGIBILITY" / "ON CAPABILITY"). A mental model summary with four column labels. A synthesis connections table. Part XVI: Follow-Up Questions as a numbered list. Then a dark footer band with small metadata text, source attribution, and tag links. [screenshots/zones/z5-workshop.png -- lower portion, screenshots/fullpage-768.png -- bottom]

**Overall first impression:** This page has real narrative shape. It opens with authority, broadens into architecture, descends into implementation detail, pauses for philosophical reflection (the prison quote), then lifts through practical workshop material into synthesis. The alternation between dark bands and cream/tan sections creates a breathing rhythm. The page is very long -- roughly 20+ viewport-heights -- but the zone transitions keep me oriented. My interest peaked at the philosophy section and the prison quote banner, dipped during the implementation details (Parts III-V), recovered at the workshop, and ended quietly. The bottom of the page has less visual investment than the top.

## PA-12: Do your eyes flow smoothly from section to section?

**CONDITIONAL**

Eyes flow well through most of the page, with friction at specific boundary points.

**Smooth flow within zones:** Within Zone 1 (Philosophy), the text moves naturally through paragraphs. Blockquotes with colored left-borders (purple for Cantillon quotes, orange/red for callout boxes) provide gentle visual breaks without disrupting the reading column. Sub-headings in bold italic serif act as clear waypoints. [screenshots/1440/scroll-02.png, screenshots/zones/z1-philosophy.png]

**Smooth flow at the best transition:** The Zone 1-to-Zone 2 handoff uses a red rule, zone label, and background shift that guide the eye forward deliberately. You cross a threshold rather than falling into a gap. [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png]

**Friction at dark boundaries:** Several zone transitions involve passing through large expanses of dark background where the content column has ended but the next zone has not yet begun. In scroll-04, the bottom half of the viewport after the Zone 2 heading is dark with no content visible -- the reader has crossed the threshold but the room is empty. [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png -- lower half] In scroll-05, a thin sliver of cream content appears at the very top and then the rest is dark void. [screenshots/1440/scroll-05.png] This pattern repeats at multiple zone boundaries.

**Friction in code-dense sections:** In Zone 2 (Architecture) and Zone 3 (Implementation), the visual rhythm becomes: paragraph, dark code block, paragraph, dark code block. The code blocks are visually similar to each other, which makes the eye lose its place during vertical scrolling. [screenshots/zones/z2-architecture.png]

The primary disruption is the dark padding between zones. Within zones, flow is generally smooth.

---

## PA-13: Is there a clear visual ending, or does the page just stop?

**CONDITIONAL**

The page has a footer that creates a visual bookend, but the final sections diminish in compositional energy.

Looking at the fullpage-768 screenshot, the page ends with Part XVI (Follow-Up Questions) as a numbered list, followed by a dark footer strip containing source attribution, metadata, and tag/category links. [screenshots/fullpage-768.png -- bottom portion] This footer band is dark, matching the header's dark tone, which creates a bookend structure: dark opening, dark closing.

However, the footer is very small and understated relative to the page's length. The header has a multi-level hierarchy (category label, large title, subtitle, metadata row). The footer has small text in a thin band. The asymmetry in compositional attention between opening and closing is pronounced.

The zone screenshots for the bottom area (z6-synthesis.png and footer.png) rendered as dark frames due to a screenshot capture issue, but the fullpage captures confirm content IS present at the bottom. The footer EXISTS but does not create a strong sense of designed conclusion.

The last three content sections (Mental Model Summary, Synthesis Connections, Follow-Up Questions) are progressively simpler -- columns, a table, and a numbered list. This gradual simplification reads as fading energy rather than deliberate restraint.

**Evidence:** [screenshots/fullpage-768.png -- bottom] -- footer visible with metadata; [screenshots/fullpage-1440.png -- bottom] -- content concluding before dark band; [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png] -- header for asymmetry comparison

---

## PA-34: Pick a transition between two major sections. Is it a DESIGNED moment or just empty space?

**YES -- the Zone 1 to Zone 2 transition is a designed moment.**

The transition between Zone 1 (Philosophy) and Zone 2 (Architecture) consists of: [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png]
1. A full-width red/orange horizontal rule that spans edge to edge
2. A zone label in spaced small-caps: "ZONE 2 -- THE SIGHT LINES -- ARCHITECTURE"
3. A background color shift from cool cream to warmer tan/khaki
4. A new part title in large italic serif: "Part II: The 8-Domain Architecture"

This is a genuine designed threshold -- multiple visual signals combine to say "you are crossing into different territory." The red rule acts as a doorstep. The zone label provides orientation. The background shift creates ambient change. This is more than just empty space between sections; it is a composed boundary.

However, not all transitions reach this standard. The intra-zone transitions between Parts (e.g., Part III to Part IV within Zone 2) are just heading changes with no supporting visual properties -- structurally marked but not designed. [screenshots/zones/z2-architecture.png -- transition between Parts III and IV]

**Evidence:** [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png] -- Zone 1-to-Zone 2 transition with red rule, background shift, and zone label

---

## PA-35: Scroll at reading speed. Does interest stay level, peak and valley, or fade? Where do you start skimming?

**CONDITIONAL -- Peak and valley with a problematic fade in the final quarter**

The interest arc I experienced:

**STRONG OPENING (Header through Zone 1):** The dark header is compelling. The TOC with its watchtower framing and two-column layout feels organized and inviting. The philosophical content in Zone 1 is well-paced with callout boxes ("THE ASYMMETRY," the Cantillon blockquote) providing visual punctuation. [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png, screenshots/1440/scroll-02.png]

**PEAK 1 (Zone 2 opening -- Part II):** The 8-Domain Architecture section is the informational highlight. The colored directory structure code block, two-column domain comparison cards with orange headers, and the four Design Principles cards create genuine visual variety and intellectual engagement. [screenshots/zones/z2-architecture.png -- upper portion with domain cards]

**DIP (Parts III-V -- Implementation):** Skimming begins around Part IV (Implementation Details). The code blocks multiply and look similar to each other -- dark rectangles of monospaced text. The prose shrinks to connective tissue between code samples. Visual monotony sets in. [screenshots/zones/z2-architecture.png -- lower portions with code blocks]

**PEAK 2 (Prison quote banner):** The full-width dark banner with "I panopticon still, but the tower belongs to you -- so still a prison?" is the visual and emotional peak of the entire page. It interrupts the technical content with a philosophical provocation rendered at display scale. [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png -- upper portion]

**RECOVERY (Parts VIII-XII):** The CLAUDE.md example cards and the Building Your Own workshop with its phased structure provide renewed visual interest. Checkpoint bars with green left-borders introduce a new visual element. [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png, screenshots/zones/z5-workshop.png]

**FADE (Parts XIII-XVI):** Visual interest declines steadily. Key quotes are paired cards (moderate interest). Mental model summary is a simple column layout. Synthesis connections is a plain table. Follow-up questions is an unadorned numbered list. Each section is plainer than the last. [screenshots/zones/z5-workshop.png -- lower portion]

The shape is: STRONG OPEN -- PEAK -- DIP -- DRAMATIC MOMENT -- RECOVERY -- FADE. The page is front-loaded with its strongest visual material. Skimming onset: Part IV (Implementation Details).

**Evidence:** [screenshots/zones/z1-philosophy.png] -- engaging opening; [screenshots/zones/z2-architecture.png] -- dense middle with dip; [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png] -- prison quote peak; [screenshots/zones/z5-workshop.png] -- fade at end

---

## PA-36: Is there a dramatic visual moment -- a place where treatment changes noticeably? Where?

**YES**

**Moment 1 (Strongest): The prison quote banner.** A full-width dark band with large italic serif text in off-white: "I panopticon still, but the tower belongs to you -- so still a prison?" Below it, two small labels ("@MOLLYCANTILLON.DEV" and "COMMUNITY PREMISE"). This is the single most visually striking element on the page. It interrupts the cream/tan reading flow with a dark, atmospheric statement that spans the full viewport width. It feels like a scene change. [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png -- upper portion]

**Moment 2: The Zone 1-to-Zone 2 red-line transition.** The full-width red horizontal rule combined with background color shift and zone label is a clear designed threshold. Multiple visual properties shift simultaneously. [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png]

**Moment 3: The three CLAUDE.md example cards.** Three side-by-side dark cards with colored syntax text appearing in the Warnings zone. These create a horizontal spread that breaks the single-column reading pattern -- the only place in the body where dark panels sit side by side. [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png -- middle portion]

**Moment 4: The header itself.** Dark near-black background with red "DEEP EXTRACTION" label and large white serif title. The opening is dramatic by design. [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png]

**Moment 5 (Minor): The "THE ASYMMETRY" callout in Zone 1.** A rose-tinted box with red label text that stands out from the surrounding cream prose. [screenshots/1440/scroll-02.png]

Dramatic moments are distributed across the top two-thirds of the page. The bottom third lacks a comparable dramatic moment -- the closest candidates are the anti-pattern cards and checkpoint bars, which are structured but not dramatic.

**Evidence:** [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png] -- prison quote banner and CLAUDE.md cards; [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png] -- red-line transition; [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png] -- header; [screenshots/1440/scroll-02.png] -- asymmetry callout

---

## PA-52: Divide page into thirds. Does each third have at least one designed moment?

**CONDITIONAL**

Using the fullpage-1440.png screenshot to estimate scroll thirds:

**Top Third (Header through approximately Part II):**
- Dark header panel with title hierarchy -- designed moment
- TOC with red/orange left-border accent and "THE WATCHTOWER" framing -- designed moment
- "THE ASYMMETRY" callout box with rose tint -- designed moment
- Zone 1-to-Zone 2 red-line transition with background shift -- designed moment
Multiple clear designed moments. **PASS.**
[screenshots/1440/cold-look.png; screenshots/zones/z1-philosophy.png; screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png]

**Middle Third (approximately Parts III through IX):**
- The prison quote banner ("...so still a prison?") -- strongest designed moment on the page
- Three side-by-side CLAUDE.md example cards -- designed moment
- Colored directory structure code block with 8 domain lines -- designed moment
- "SIGNAL ANALYSIS" callout with coral tint -- designed moment
Multiple designed moments anchored by the page's visual peak. **PASS.**
[screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png; screenshots/zones/z3-implementation.png]

**Bottom Third (approximately Parts X through XVI + Footer):**
- Anti-pattern cards in 2x2 grid with orange headers -- structured element
- Workshop checkpoint bars with green left-borders -- structured element
- Key quote paired cards with colored headers -- structured element
- Mental model summary with four columns -- structured element
- Dark footer band -- bookend element

These are competent, organized elements, but none rises to the level of a "designed moment" comparable to the prison quote banner, the red-line transition, or the header. The checkpoint bars have a pleasant rhythm. The paired quote cards have color accents. But the bottom third feels more like organized information than composed design. **CONDITIONAL PASS -- elements present but no single element has the visual impact of a true designed moment.**

**Evidence:** [screenshots/fullpage-1440.png] -- full scroll for third estimation; [screenshots/zones/z5-workshop.png] -- bottom third content; [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png] -- middle third peak; [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png] -- top third

## PA-62: Find a section transition. Count how many visual properties change simultaneously. Is the result dramatic (3+ shifts) or quiet (1 shift)? Are there BOTH kinds?

**YES**

**Dramatic transition -- Zone 1 to Zone 2 (5 shifts):**
At this boundary [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png], I count:
1. Background color shifts from cool cream to warmer tan
2. A full-width red horizontal rule appears (new element)
3. Zone label text appears in spaced small-caps (new element type)
4. Part heading resets to large italic display serif
5. Overall density about to increase (structured cards and code blocks incoming)
That is 5 simultaneous visual property changes -- clearly dramatic. This placement is appropriate because it marks the shift from philosophical groundwork to architectural specifics.

**Quiet transition -- Sub-section to sub-section within Zone 1 (1 shift):**
Within Zone 1, the transition from "The Institutional Asymmetry Problem" to "What Self-Legibility Actually Means" [screenshots/1440/scroll-02.png] involves:
1. A new bold italic subheading
That is 1 shift -- just the heading. Background, spacing, and text treatment remain consistent. Appropriate for a continuation within the same topic.

**Medium transition -- Content to prison quote banner (3 shifts):**
The prison quote banner [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png] involves:
1. Background shifts from cream to dark
2. Text shifts from body to large italic display
3. Width shifts from column-width to full-bleed
That is 3 shifts -- dramatic, and appropriately placed at the page's philosophical pivot point.

Both dramatic and quiet transitions exist. Dramatic transitions correlate with zone boundaries (major content shifts). Quiet transitions mark sub-sections within a zone. This variation is purposeful.

**Evidence:** [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png] -- dramatic zone transition (5 shifts); [screenshots/1440/scroll-02.png] -- quiet sub-section transition (1 shift); [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png] -- medium-dramatic prison quote (3 shifts)

---

## PA-69: Pick two section transitions. Count visual properties changing. Are transition intensities varied or uniform? Do the changes at each boundary AGREE or CONTRADICT?

**YES**

**Transition 1: Zone 1 (Philosophy) to Zone 2 (Architecture):**
[screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png]
Properties changing:
1. Background: cream to warmer tan (warmer, slightly darker)
2. Separator: red full-width horizontal rule (new element)
3. Label: zone identifier in spaced small-caps (new element)
4. Heading: large italic serif part title
5. Content density increases (cards, code blocks follow)

**Do these changes AGREE?** YES. The warmer, slightly darker background says "going deeper." The zone label says "new territory." The red rule says "threshold." The increased density ahead says "more structured content." All changes point in the same direction: from open philosophical contemplation toward structured architectural detail. COHERENT.

**Transition 2: End of Zone 2 content into dark padding:**
[screenshots/1440/scroll-05.png]
Properties changing:
1. Background: tan/cream to very dark (near-black)
2. Content: present to absent

**Do these changes AGREE?** This is problematic. The background goes dark, which could signal "important dark-themed content ahead" (as in the header or the prison quote banner). But there is no content -- just dark emptiness. The dark background promises something dramatic that the void does not deliver. This is a CONTRADICTION -- the visual signal (dramatic dark shift) disagrees with the content reality (nothing).

**Transition intensities are varied.** The designed Zone 1-to-Zone 2 boundary has 5 coherent property shifts. The void transition has 2 property shifts that contradict. However, the variation between designed transitions and void transitions is not purposeful variation -- the voids are a defect in execution, not a design choice.

**Evidence:** [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png] -- coherent dramatic transition; [screenshots/1440/scroll-05.png] -- contradictory void transition

---

## PA-71: At the boundary between two adjacent zones, does the transition feel like a smooth handoff or an abrupt collision? Does the transition technique SERVE the content shift?

**CONDITIONAL**

**Smooth handoff -- Zone 1 to Zone 2:** [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png]
The end of Zone 1's philosophical prose flows into a concluding paragraph. Then the red rule appears. Then the zone label. Then the new part title. This is a three-step handoff: content conclusion, visual threshold, new content introduction. It SERVES the content shift because the reader has absorbed philosophical framing and needs to transition to architectural specifics. The rule creates a conscious moment of "I'm entering different content."

**Smooth handoff -- Prison quote banner:** [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png]
The full-width dark banner with the prison quote serves as both content AND transition. It is simultaneously a philosophical moment and a visual gateway between the technical critique section and the practical examples section. This dual function makes it the most effective transition on the page -- it does not just separate sections, it transforms the reading experience. The technique deeply SERVES the content.

**Abrupt collision -- Zone content to dark void:** [screenshots/1440/scroll-05.png]
The two-column domain cards end. Then there is dark void filling most of the viewport. The content stops and darkness begins without a transitional element -- no concluding statement, no separator, no gradual spacing increase. This does NOT serve the content shift; it interrupts it. The dark void reads as a rendering gap, not a designed pause.

**Diminishing handoffs -- Later zone transitions:**
The transitions between Zone 4 (Warnings) and Zone 5 (Workshop) and between Zone 5 and Zone 6 (Synthesis) follow the same zone-label + red-rule pattern but feel increasingly routine. The early transitions feel motivated; the later ones feel like they are repeating a formula without fresh energy. The Zone 5-to-Zone 6 label ("THE DEPARTURE HALL -- SYNTHESIZE & REFERENCE") is the most evocative zone name but the visual treatment does not match its ambition.

**Evidence:** [screenshots/1440/scroll-04.png] -- smooth handoff; [screenshots/1440/scroll-05.png] -- abrupt void collision; [screenshots/zones/z4-warnings.png] -- prison quote as dual-function transition

---

## PA-74: Pick a boundary where the page changes. Do ALL the changes point in the same direction?

**YES**

**Boundary analyzed: Header to Table of Contents** [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png, screenshots/1440/retake-top.png]

Changes observed:
1. **Background:** dark (near-black) to warm cream -- LIGHTER
2. **Text color:** off-white/gray to dark gray -- DARKER (maintaining contrast)
3. **Typography:** large serif display title to smaller regular body text -- SMALLER
4. **Density:** sparse metadata layout to organized two-column list -- DENSER
5. **Accent color:** red label at top carries through as red left-border on TOC -- CONSISTENT
6. **Emotional register:** authoritative/dramatic to organized/navigational -- IMPACT to UTILITY

Do ALL changes agree? YES. The shift from dark-to-light background combined with display-to-body typography and authoritative-to-organizational tone all say the same thing: "the grand entrance is over; now we orient you." The cream background is welcoming. The organized two-column list is functional. The red accent carries through as a unifying thread. Every change is directionally coherent: we are moving from DECLARATION to NAVIGATION.

This is one of the page's strongest design decisions -- the header-to-TOC vocabulary is internally consistent.

**Evidence:** [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png] -- header to TOC boundary showing coherent directional changes; [screenshots/1440/retake-top.png] -- same boundary confirming details

---

## PA-75: Scroll to the very bottom. Does the page end with a DESIGNED conclusion, or does it just stop? Is there any area that looks like the designer ran out of time?

**CONDITIONAL**

The page has a closing structure but the final sections show diminishing compositional energy.

**What is present at the bottom:** [screenshots/fullpage-768.png -- bottom; screenshots/zones/z5-workshop.png -- lower portion]
- Part XIV (Mental Model Summary): four labeled columns and a brief paragraph -- competent but plain
- Part XV (Synthesis Connections): a simple three-column table
- Part XVI (Follow-Up Questions): a numbered list of 8 questions
- Footer: a dark band with small metadata text, source attribution, and tag/category links

The footer band DOES create a visual bookend with the header -- both are dark with lighter text. This is a designed closure decision.

**However, the final sections feel like diminishing energy:**
Each successive section is simpler than the last. Part XIV has some visual structure (columns). Part XV is just a table. Part XVI is just a numbered list. This simplification does not feel like deliberate restraint building toward a quiet ending -- it feels like the design energy ran out.

Compare the opening: the header has a multi-level hierarchy (category label, large title, subtitle, metadata row), all carefully composed. The ending has a numbered list followed by a thin dark band. The asymmetry in compositional attention between opening and closing is significant.

**Does it look like the designer ran out of time?** The bottom 20% of the page (Parts XIII-XVI) is visually impoverished compared to the top 20%. The checkpoint bars disappear after Part XII. Visual variety drops. The closing follow-up questions are conceptually appropriate (turning inquiry back on the reader) but their visual treatment is unadorned.

That said, the dark footer bookend and the follow-up questions as a closing gesture prevent this from being a "just stops" ending. It is a quiet conclusion rather than a dramatic one.

**Evidence:** [screenshots/zones/z5-workshop.png] -- final sections showing progressive simplification; [screenshots/fullpage-768.png] -- footer visible with metadata text; [screenshots/1440/cold-look.png] -- opening for asymmetry comparison

## Summary of Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- Zone transition vocabulary is internally consistent -- changes at boundaries agree directionally (PA-62 YES, PA-69 YES, PA-74 YES)
- Dramatic vs quiet transition intensities correlate with content importance: zone boundaries are 4-5 property shifts, sub-sections are 1 shift
- The prison quote banner is the page's strongest visual moment -- it functions as both content and transition simultaneously
- The header-to-TOC handoff shows coherent directional change across 6 properties
- The page has a genuine narrative shape: authority, exploration, depth, philosophical pivot, practical workshop, synthesis

**Concerns:**
- Dark void padding at zone boundaries breaks reading flow -- the visual signal (dramatic dark shift) contradicts the content reality (nothing there)
- Bottom third lacks a designed moment comparable to the top and middle thirds (PA-52 CONDITIONAL)
- Interest fades progressively after the prison quote -- the last four sections are each plainer than the previous (PA-35 CONDITIONAL)
- The ending is compositionally asymmetric with the opening -- header gets careful hierarchy, footer gets a thin dark strip (PA-75 CONDITIONAL)
- Code-dense sections (Parts III-V) create visual monotony that triggers skimming

**Verdict counts:** 5 YES (PA-34, PA-36, PA-62, PA-69, PA-74), 6 CONDITIONAL (PA-12, PA-13, PA-35, PA-52, PA-71, PA-75), 0 NO

**Pattern:** Design energy follows a decay curve -- highest at the header, strong through Zone 2, peaks at the prison quote, then gradually diminishes through Zone 5-6. The designed transitions are excellent; the dark-void execution undermines them.

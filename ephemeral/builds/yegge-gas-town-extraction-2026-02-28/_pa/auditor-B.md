## Section 0: The Experiential Pass

### COLD LOOK (1440px)

**Gut reaction:** This page starts with promising material -- dark header, varied blocks, some tables and diagrams -- then falls off a cliff into an ocean of nothingness.

**Worst thing:** Starting around one-third of the way down, the page becomes an unbroken wall of pale cream emptiness that continues for the remaining two-thirds of the total height. There is nothing there. No text, no structure, no hint of content. It looks like the page broke.

**Best thing:** The top portion has a clear alternation between dark blocks (which appear to contain code or diagrams rendered in light text on near-black backgrounds) and lighter prose sections with warm-toned callout boxes. That first third shows genuine compositional intent.

**Ship it?:** NO

### COLD LOOK (768px)

**Gut reaction:** Same structure visible at narrower width -- content stacks taller and narrower in the first third, then the same catastrophic void takes over.

**Worst thing:** Identical to desktop: the void. At this narrower width, the content portion is even more compressed, making the empty expanse feel proportionally even larger and more jarring.

**Best thing:** The narrower layout actually makes the content sections feel tighter and more readable. The dark code blocks and light prose sections have a stronger visual rhythm when they are stacked closer at this width.

**Ship it?:** NO

### THE SCROLL-THROUGH

I moved through the first three viewports at reading speed -- a warm header area, a "Who is Steve Yegge?" section with three identity cards side by side, a highlighted insight box in pale gold, a transition marker, a quote with an orange left-bar, an ASCII-style architecture diagram on a dark background, and then a role card labeled "The Mayor (Orchestrator)" with a short bullet list. Interesting, coherent, building well. Then, immediately after the role card, I entered what can only be described as a desert. I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled -- twenty-one full viewport heights of pale cream nothingness. No content, no text, no elements whatsoever. I would have closed the tab after the second blank screen. A real reader would never reach whatever might exist below this void.

## Q-02: Scroll Speed

"Scroll through the entire page at reading speed. Where did you speed up? Where did you slow down? Where did you stop?"

I slowed down in the very first few screens. The "Who is Steve Yegge?" section with the three identity labels ("Systems Thinker," "Pragmatist," "10x-100x Gains") arranged side by side felt like a well-organized introduction, and the orange-highlighted key insight block below it made me pause -- it was saying something specific about organizational patterns rather than just "use agents." The quote with the orange bar and the ASCII architecture diagram on dark background were the last moments I felt engaged. Then I hit the role card for "The Mayor" and, one scroll later, nothing. I stopped scrolling with any purpose around the fourth blank screen. After that I was just scrubbing to see if anything existed below. The page effectively ended for me about one-sixth of the way through its total height. Everything after that was abandonment, not reading.

## Q-08: Thirds Analysis

"Divide the page into thirds by scroll depth. Does each third feel like it got the same amount of attention from the designer, or did someone get tired?"

This is not a case of someone getting tired. The first third contains ALL of the page's content -- the header, the background section, the mental model section, the quote, the diagram, the first role card. It shows genuine thought about how to present information: varied visual weights, callout boxes, transition markers between sections, a coherent sense of progression. The second third is blank. Completely blank. Not sparse, not minimal, not breathing room -- blank. Nothing at all. The bottom third is also blank, with the exception that the full-page overview suggests there might be a footer element at the very bottom, but it is surrounded by such an immense void that it feels like finding a message in a bottle in the middle of the Pacific. Someone did not get tired. Something went catastrophically wrong -- as if the page was only partially built, or content is hidden behind some mechanism that failed to trigger.

## Q-14: Rhythm

"Is there a rhythm to this page -- a beat you can feel? Or does it feel more like a series of unrelated events?"

In the content-bearing portion (the top sixth to fifth of the total page), there is a discernible rhythm. It goes: dark header, then light prose, then a row of cards, then a warm-toned callout, then a transition strip, then more prose, then a quote with emphasis, then a dark diagram block, then a light role card. That sequence alternates between light-background reading sections and darker emphasis/structural blocks, creating a gentle pulse. It is not a strong beat -- more like a slow heartbeat. But the rhythm is destroyed utterly by what follows. Imagine listening to a song that plays two bars of a nice melody and then emits twenty bars of silence. You would not say the song has rhythm. You would say the song is broken. Whatever rhythmic pattern existed in the content section is negated by the void that constitutes the vast majority of the page's actual scroll length.

## Q-18: Best Moment

"What's the single best moment on this page -- the one thing you'd point to as evidence of genuine design thinking? Describe what makes it work."

The best moment is the transition from the "Key Insight" callout box into the architecture diagram. The callout sits on a warm, pale-gold background with an orange accent on the left side and uses an italic serif typeface to present what feels like the central thesis: that the contribution is not "use agents" but an organizational pattern. Below it, a thin transition strip reads "FROM PERSON TO PATTERN," and then a new section heading announces "The Gas Town Mental Model," followed by an ASCII-rendered architecture diagram on a near-black background showing "Research Shop," "Code Shop," "Testing Shop" connecting down to a "Town Clerk (Memory)" node. This sequence works because it moves from abstract claim to concrete visualization in a way that feels earned -- the text tells you what the idea IS, the diagram shows you what it LOOKS LIKE. The tonal shift from warm gold to near-black is dramatic enough to mark a genuine shift in mode (from persuasion to explanation) without feeling jarring. It is the one moment where form and content are working together. Unfortunately, it is also the last real moment on the page before the void swallows everything.

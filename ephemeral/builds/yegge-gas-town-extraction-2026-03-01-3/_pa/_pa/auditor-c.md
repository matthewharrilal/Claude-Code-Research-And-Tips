Now I have thoroughly examined all three screenshots. Let me write my full audit report.

# Auditor C: Spatial + Proportion

## 0. Experiential Pass

Looking at the desktop (1440px) screenshot as a first-time viewer: The page opens with a dark header occupying the first ~150px, then transitions to a warm cream zone with an italic epigraph and a bordered Table of Contents. Below, the page flows through progressively denser zones — a complexity ladder on dark background, comparison panels side-by-side, a credential-building gate zone with tables, then the massive Government District with its three-column role card grids and dark architecture diagrams. This is the visual peak — the densest, heaviest region. After this, the page decompresses through infrastructure content (memory layers, wave tables, principle blocks), through a code-heavy operations zone, through clustered pull quotes at the crossroads, and into a sparse archive with source links, tag clouds, and metadata. A dark footer bookends the page. The overall spatial impression is **confident and well-proportioned** — content is centered in a 960px column with full-bleed zone backgrounds painting the flanking space, creating the feeling of moving through distinct rooms rather than scrolling a narrow strip.

At tablet (768px): The two-column grids collapse to single columns. Role cards stack vertically. The content fills more horizontal space. Code blocks and diagrams show slightly smaller text but remain readable. The spatial feeling shifts from "rooms with wings" to "a single corridor" — still functional, still breathing.

At mobile (375px): Everything is single-column with tight ~16px side margins. The page becomes extremely long. Dark code blocks span nearly edge-to-edge. Pull quotes retain their red left borders. The spatial density feels appropriate for mobile — nothing cramped, nothing wasted.

## Question Responses

### PA-11: Margin Generosity
**"Are the margins generous (confident) or anxious (clutching)?"**

**Assessment: YES — Margins are generous and confident.**

**Evidence:**
- [desktop/full-page] At 1440px, the 960px content column sits centered with approximately 240px of open space on each side. This is not dead space — the zone background colors (warm cream, dusty earth, town square tan, district stone) extend full-bleed across the viewport, so the flanking areas carry the room's warmth rather than appearing blank.
- [desktop/header-zone] The header has very generous vertical padding — roughly 64px above and below the title text, creating a spacious entryway feel.
- [desktop/outskirts-zone] The opening outskirts zone has the most generous vertical spacing of any zone — approximately 80px top and bottom padding — the page "breathes in" before presenting content.
- [tablet/full-page] At 768px, side margins narrow to roughly 16px but the content now fills a greater proportion of horizontal space, maintaining a confident feel rather than a squeezed one.
- [mobile/full-page] At 375px, side margins are tight (~16px) but appropriate — content breathes within mobile conventions without feeling clutched.

The margins throughout read as deliberate spatial confidence. No area feels anxiously tight or wastefully empty.

**Severity: NONE**

### PA-30: Layout Design at 1440px
**"At 1440px, does the layout feel DESIGNED for this width, or centered in extra space?"**

**Assessment: CONDITIONAL — Designed, with one reservation.**

**Evidence:**
- [desktop/full-page] The 960px content spine occupies approximately 67% of the 1440px viewport. The full-bleed zone backgrounds extend edge-to-edge, which prevents the "narrow strip floating in white" effect. The dark header, dark code blocks, dark architecture diagrams, and dark footer all run the full viewport width, anchoring the layout to the edges.
- [desktop/role-cards-zone] The Government District's three-column role card grid fills the 960px column densely, and the zone background extends full-width in a slightly darker tone — this section feels most designed for this width.
- [desktop/comparison-grids] The two-column comparison grids (before/after panels, decision columns) fill the content width with good proportions — roughly 460px per panel with a gap between.

**Reservation:** The content column at 960px in 1440px is at the lower boundary of the 65-80% range (67%). While the zone backgrounds mitigate this well, in sections with only body text and short paragraphs (particularly the prose-only parts of the Crossroads zone), the flanking empty space feels slightly more noticeable — approaching "centered in space" rather than "designed for this width." This is minor because the variety of full-width elements (code blocks, diagrams, zone backgrounds) counterbalances it effectively.

**Severity: MINOR**

### PA-31: Surrounding Space Quality
**"If you covered the content and only looked at the surrounding space, would it feel designed or leftover?"**

**Assessment: YES — The surrounding space feels designed.**

**Evidence:**
- [desktop/full-page] If I mentally cover the 960px content column, the flanking space is NOT uniform white. I see a visible progression of background tones: warm cream (outskirts) → dusty tan (gate) → lighter warm (town square) → darker stone (district) → muted warm (infrastructure) → cool neutral (operations) → warm open (crossroads) → quiet tan (archive). These tonal shifts are visible in the side margins and create a sense of moving through different rooms.
- [desktop/header-footer] The dark header and footer extend fully to the viewport edges, creating strong horizontal anchors at top and bottom. The 3px red border beneath the header is a designed threshold.
- [desktop/zone-boundaries] The 3px border lines at zone boundaries extend full-width, further demonstrating that the surrounding space participates in the design.

The empty flanking space carries color information and participates in the zone system. It reads as designed negative space, not leftover margin.

**Severity: NONE**

### PA-32: Visual Weight Distribution
**"Squint at the full page. Is the visual weight distributed purposefully across the scroll?"**

**Assessment: YES — Visual weight is distributed with clear purposeful arc.**

**Evidence:**
- [desktop/full-page, squinted] Squinting at the full-page screenshot, I perceive a clear density arc:
  - **Top 15%:** Dark header (heavy) → light outskirts with one dark ladder block (light-to-medium). The page opens sparse and orienting.
  - **20-40%:** Gate zone with tables (medium) → Town Square with comparison grids (medium). Building density.
  - **35-55%:** Government District with three-column role card grids and two large dark architecture diagrams (HEAVIEST). This is unmistakably the gravitational center — the most dark blocks appear concentrated here.
  - **55-70%:** Infrastructure zone with memory layers, wave tables, and principle blocks (medium-heavy). Decompression begins but content remains substantial.
  - **70-85%:** Operations zone with dense dark code blocks stacked close together (heavy, but lighter than District). The darkest region below the midpoint.
  - **85-95%:** Crossroads with pull-quote clusters and comparison tables (medium). Resolving.
  - **95-100%:** Archive with source lists, tag cloud, metadata grid, and dark footer (medium-light, bookended by heavy footer).

The visual weight follows a clear build → peak → sustain → resolve shape. The Government District at roughly the 40% mark is the unambiguous peak. The Operations section provides a second heavyweight section, and the closing archive thins purposefully toward the footer bookend.

**Severity: NONE**

### PA-33: Largest Empty Space
**"Pick the largest area of empty space. Does it feel like silence in music or a dropped signal?"**

**Assessment: YES — Largest empty spaces feel like deliberate sile

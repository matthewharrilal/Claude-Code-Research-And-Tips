  "result": "<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: Five sections (8-12) spanning two zone environments. Sections 8-9 extend the operations zone with a neutral `--zone-operations` (#FAFAF5) background — the reader stays in the practical building while verifying installation health and diagnosing six classified failure modes. The zone boundary at Section 10 carries a `zone-boundary--primary` (3px red) — the heaviest transition signal in the system — marking the domain shift from diagnostic to evaluative. Sections 10-12 inhabit a new `--zone-crossroads` (#FAF6EE) zone, warmer and more generous than operations, with 80px vertical padding. The `.failure-scenario` component uses 2-zone DNA (coral-accented header zone + body zone with SYMPTOM/CAUSE/RECOVERY anatomy). The `.decision-columns` component uses green/coral border-color encoding for go/stop evaluation. The `.quote-cluster` component groups pull-quotes under monospace theme labels with tightened margins. The closing essence callout — \"Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant\" — sits at the bottom of the crossroads zone as earned resolution. Three comparison tables use the existing `.table-wrapper` + `.data-table` system with `.comparison-verdict` blocks beneath them. The orchestrator spectrum diagram reuses the `.arch-diagram` container family (same as complexity ladder and hierarchy diagram).\n\nTRYING: To make the crossroads zone feel like standing at an actual decision point — warm, open, honest. The green/coral decision columns create visual polarity without aggression: both columns have equal structural weight, neither outcome judged. The failure scenarios were designed to feel like a reference manual at a hospital desk — structured, repetitive, trustworthy. Each failure follows the identical 3-field pattern (symptom/cause/recovery) because in a crisis you need pattern recognition, not novelty. The quote gallery (Section 11) was intentionally sparse — the pull-quotes sit in thematic clusters with tight margins and breathing-zone theme labels, creating a curated gallery rather than a wall of quotes. The density arc across these five sections: medium (tables) → medium-high (6 failure scenarios) → [primary boundary] → medium (decision lists) → low (quotes) → high (3 comparison tables) → resolution (essence callout). The final rise in density (comparison tables) before the closing essence creates a \"last look back at the settlement\" moment before the reader departs.\n\nREJECTED: (1) Using the `.principle-block` component for failure scenarios — considered it because principles and failures both have header+body structure, but the semantic meaning is wrong: principles are philosophical truths, failures are diagnostic entries. Created `.failure-scenario` instead with coral accent (warning register) vs the principle block's dark/primary headers (authority register). (2) Varying the pull-quote border color by theme in Section 11 — considered using amber for philosophical quotes, green for practical, coral for warnings — but the uniform red border maintains Yegge's voice as ONE voice regardless of topic, which is the right editorial decision. (3) A drop-cap opening on Section 10 — the crossroads zone should feel open and direct, not editorial. Drop caps signal \"begin a journey\" and we're ending one. (4) Putting sections 8-9 inside the same zone div as Section 7 (implementation) rather than a new operations zone div — but the existing zone closed before the NEXT_CHUNK marker, and reopening it would require restructuring the previous chunk. A new zone div with the same class preserves visual continuity while maintaining structural independence.\n\nSURPRISED: The `.failure-scenario` component creates a visual rhythm across the six failures that functions like a heartbeat monitor — regular, predictable, trustworthy. The coral accent on the failure numbers creates a secondary visual tracking system: you can scan the left edge for \"FAILURE 01... 02... 03...\" without reading the names. This wasn't designed — it emerged from the combination of monospace numbering + coral color + left-aligned header position. Also surprised by how the decision columns (Section 10) rhyme visually with the comparison-grid panels from Zone 3 (the ant/colony comparison). Both are 2-column grids with semantically differentiated borders. The reader unconsciously recognizes the pattern: \"I'm comparing two things\" — but in Zone 3 it was abstract philosophy and here it's concrete self-assessment. Same component DNA, different knowledge state. The closing essence callout (\"Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant\") genuinely does resonate differently after 3000+ lines of architecture, infrastructure, operations, and diagnostics. At the top, it was a clever turn of phrase. At the bottom, it's a summary of everything the reader now understands.\n\nWANTED: A sticky sidebar navigation for the troubleshooting section (Mechanism #8) — when scrolling through 6 failure scenarios, the reader loses position context. A sidebar showing \"Failure 1 of 6\" with active highlighting would help. But JavaScript is prohibited and CSS-only sticky positioning within a complex zone creates responsive complications. Also wanted to add a closing pull-quote from Yegge after the comparison tables — something that bridges from \"here are your options\" to \"here's what matters\" — but the source content doesn't provide one at this structural position, and the essence callout serves the closure function adequately.\n\nUNRESOLVED: The quote gallery in Section 11 contains 15 pull-quotes across 7 themes. Even with tightened cluster margins, this creates significant vertical scroll. The quotes section might benefit from a 2-column layout at wider viewports (theme label spanning both columns, quotes in 2-col grid). But this would break the pull-quote's max-width: 55ch constraint and change its reading rhythm. The next pass should evaluate whether the quote density feels right in the browser. The comparison tables in Section 12 are dense reference content at the end of a sparse zone — the density contrast is intentional (a \"last look back\") but might feel abrupt. A brief prose introduction before the first comparison table (\"Three alternative orchestration patterns occupy different points on the complexity spectrum\") might smooth the transition — but adding prose not in the source content is editorial overreach.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: The `.failure-scenario` component reuses the same 2-zone DNA as callouts (Mechanism #2: sparse header zone + dense body zone) but encodes different semantics. Callouts use accent-color left borders to differentiate types; failure scenarios use coral accent in the NUMBER position, not the border. This is the same mechanism (typographic/color hierarchy in a bounded container) adapted for diagnostic vs advisory content. The R5 finding about \"components as characters with moods\" explains why: callouts are advisory voices (tip=friendly, gotcha=urgent), failure scenarios are diagnostic records (clinical, repetitive, trustworthy). Same structural DNA, different character.\n- Discovery 2: The `zone-boundary--primary` (3px red border) appears at exactly four points on the page: entering the town square (Zone 3), entering the government district (Zone 4), entering the infrastructure zone (Zone 5), and now entering the crossroads (Zone 7). Each red boundary marks a DOMAIN shift (philosophical → architectural → operational → evaluative). The standard `zone-boundary` (3px neutral border) marks INTENSITY shifts within the same domain (outskirts → gate, operations → operations continued). The border color system is encoding two different kinds of boundary — the design system's border categories (structural vs separator) map onto the content's boundary types (domain vs intensity) without either system being designed for this purpose.\n- Discovery 3",

DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**The settlement metaphor is load-bearing, not decorative.** The creative direction asked for a page structured like approaching an unfamiliar town — sparse outskirts, a checkpoint gate, a town square, a dense government district. This builder didn't just name the zones; they built rooms that feel different to stand in. The outskirts breathe. The gate tightens with the career table. The government district is genuinely heavy — you feel the weight of eight role cards pressing against each other in their bento grids. When the infrastructure zone opens up afterward, you feel relief. That relief is earned, not accidental. The density wave the Research Synthesis (Principle 1: Density as Rhythm) describes — HIGH→LOW→HIGH cycles — is operating at the zone level, and you can feel it in your body as you scroll.\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md shaped the component choreography.** The two-callout limit (Finding T4) is respected everywhere. After six consecutive role cards — the densest stretch on the page — a Tip callout appears as a temperature buffer (Principle T3: Semantic Dissonance prevention). The Essence callouts close heavy sections, which directly implements the density debt concept from R3 (Insight 30). The pull-quotes interrupt the editorial register at structurally motivated moments, not randomly. The \"50 First Dates\" quote opens the Beads section, the \"biggest fuckin' ant\" quote opens the Town Square, the \"Idea Compiler\" quote deepens the Town Square — each appears where R5's \"Setup-Payoff Arc\" (Principle S1) says a principle statement or demonstration should land. This isn't citation; it's structural instinct.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md governs the memory layer visualization.** The Beads three-tier model (hot/warm/cold context) is translated into three simultaneous visual encoding channels: border weight (4px hot, 3px warm, 1px cold — R1's border-weight gradient), background color (coral warmth for hot, amber for warm, blue for cold), and header color. Three channels encoding one concept. This directly implements R3's geological model (Insight 5: surface/sediment/bedrock layers) and the synthesis principle that density should be encoded through multiple dimensions simultaneously. A builder who hadn't read R3 deeply would have made three identically-bordered boxes with different labels.\n\n**R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS.md's bento grid pattern structures the government district.** The role cards are organized in 3-column grids for same-tier roles, 2-column for the worker level, and full-width for the Overseer. This matches R4's prescription: \"Large cells signal importance (big box = big deal).\" The Overseer card is the widest. The town-level cards have dark headers signaling global authority; the rig-level cards have standard headers; the Overseer card has a red header. This tier-differentiation system isn't in any single research file — it emerges from understanding R4's bento grid, R5's component moods, and the content's hierarchical structure simultaneously.\n\n**The creative direction's central tension — ambition against honesty — is held throughout.** The pull-quotes vibrate with industrial excitement (\"Idea Compiler,\" \"slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels\"). Then the Gotcha callout about superintelligent chimpanzees slams the gate shut. The cost math block renders Yegge's spending ($300/day, $80,000/year) in monospace against dark background — the numbers land harder in that typography, which is exactly what the creative direction means by \"feeling the heat from the refinery.\" Neither pole wins. The page doesn't become a sales pitch or a warning label.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**Zone background differentiation exists but is nearly invisible.** The CSS defines five zone backgrounds (`#FEF9F5`, `#F8F2EA`, `#FAF5ED`, `#F5F0E8`, `#F7F2EA`) that differ by such small increments they're essentially imperceptible on screen. R3's zone background differentiation mechanism (Mechanism #7) calls for backgrounds that encode settlement distance — but the encoding here is so faint that the transitions rely entirely on the 3px border boundaries between zones. The zone system works because of the borders, not because of the backgrounds. The backgrounds are technically present but experientially absent.\n\n**The CSS comments reference mechanism numbers extensively** — `/* R1: Border-weight gradient (Mechanism #1) */`, `/* R5: Temperature buffer */`, `/* R3: density debt payment */` — and many of these are genuine structural decisions. But some comments describe what any competent builder would have done without the research. The career table wrapped in a 3px border doesn't need a mechanism citation to justify its existence. The comments sometimes feel like provenance documentation rather than evidence of influence.\n\n**The drop-cap class is defined in CSS but never deployed in the HTML.** The creative direction doesn't explicitly call for drop caps, but the builder defined `.drop-cap::first-letter` with a 3.5em Instrument Serif initial in primary red. It sits unused. This might have been powerful at the opening of the Town Square section — the first body text after the core \"ant\" quote — where an editorial opening signal could mark the moment the reader enters the philosophical center.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**The page is incomplete — sections 8-13 are missing.** The `<!-- NEXT_CHUNK -->` marker after the Implementation Guide means the creative arc's resolution phase is entirely absent. The creative direction specifically describes Zone 7 as \"sparse, resolving\" — the decision matrix, the comparison tables, the closing quote that resonates differently after everything the reader has absorbed. Without this, the page currently builds to the operations zone and then stops mid-sentence. The emotional arc has no payoff. This is the most significant absence, though it's clearly intentional chunking rather than oversight.\n\n**R4's cinematic patterns are not deployed.** The wide-close-wide rhythm (establishing shot → close-up → wide shot) described in R4 Section 3.2 would serve the teaching sections well — particularly the Beads section, which moves from the \"50 First Dates\" problem (establishing shot) directly into technical details (close-up) without ever pulling back to a synthesis moment (wide shot). The section ends with a Tip callout about Git advantages, but there's no moment of \"here's what we just understood and why it matters.\" This is also missing from the Core Principles section, which presents six principles sequentially without a synthesis moment between the first three and the last three.\n\n**R3's fractal self-similarity is absent at the component level.** The page has good macro-level rhythm (zone to zone), but within individual components the pacing is uniform. Every role card has identical internal anatomy: header → function label → responsibility list → commands → model recommendation. Every principle block has identical anatomy: header → quote → explanation → list. DD-006 describes fractal density as \"the same rhythm visible at every zoom level.\" At the component zoom level, these cards are metronomic rather than rhythmic. This isn't a failure — the uniformity creates scanability in the dense government district — but it means the fractal dimension is only operating at two of the four possible scales (page, section) rather than all four.\n\n**R5's \"Teaching Moment\" sequence** (Essence → Core Abstraction → Code → Tip) is never deployed. This matters less for an extraction/reference document than it would for a tutorial, but the Beads section would have been a natural fit: the \"50 First Dates\" problem could serve as the Essence moment, the architecture diagram as the Core Abstraction, the commands as the Code, and the Git advantages as the Tip. The components are all present — they're just not sequenced in the research-prescribed teaching order.\n\n---\n\n### 4. SURPRISED\n\n*",

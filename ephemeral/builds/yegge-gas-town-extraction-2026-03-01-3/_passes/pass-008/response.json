The builder has internalized R5's temperature model (warm/neutral/cold) and velocity mismatch rule to a degree that feels instinctive rather than applied. After six consecutive role cards in the government district — the densest sequence on the entire page — a tip callout appears beside the seventh card (Crew), and you can *feel* the density debt being paid. It doesn't feel like someone checking a box. It feels like someone who understood that readers need to exhale after absorbing six dense structures.\n\nThe anxiety-ending anti-pattern (R5 A7) is avoided everywhere. Troubleshooting, which is the most anxiety-inducing section by nature, closes with a warm tip: \"Most failures recover with a soft reset.\" The crossroads gotcha is followed by the earned essence callout. Every section resolves rather than abandons the reader.\n\nThe 2-callout limit from R5 Principle T4 is honored throughout. I cannot find a single instance of three consecutive callouts. This discipline is invisible to a reader who hasn't read the research — they just feel that the page *breathes correctly*. That invisibility is the mark of deep integration.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Zone Background Differentiation and Density Wave**\n\nThe zone system is not decoration. The creative direction prescribed a settlement approach — outskirts to gate to town square to government district — and the builder has mapped this to a background color progression that genuinely encodes settlement distance. The outskirts (#FEF9F5) feels like open air. The district (#F5F0E8) feels like stone. The crossroads (#FAF6EE) opens back up. You don't need to read the hex values to feel this — the page gets earthier and denser as you approach the architecture, then releases as you move toward decision.\n\nR3's WAVE density pattern is structurally present in the page's overall arc: sparse opening, building through credentials, peaking at the 8 roles bento grid, decompressing through Beads and principles, rebuilding through operations, and resolving sparse at the crossroads. This isn't a single crescendo — it's a wave with a genuine crest and trough, which is harder to build than a simple ramp.\n\n**DD-006-fractal — Border-Weight Gradient Encoding (Mechanism #1)**\n\nThe memory layer visualization for Beads is where DD-006's border-weight gradient mechanism sings most clearly. Hot context gets a 4-pixel left border in red. Warm context gets a 3-pixel border in amber. Cold context gets a 1-pixel border in blue. The builder didn't copy fractal's \"same pattern at all scales\" — they correctly extracted the *reusable mechanism* (border weight encodes priority) while ignoring the metaphor-specific structure. This distinction is precisely what DD-006's \"What YOU Extract\" section demands, and the builder honored it.\n\nThe tier labels in the government district also use border-weight differentiation: town-level gets the red bottom border, rig-level gets black, worker-level gets grey. Authority is encoded in weight without any text needing to say \"this tier is more important.\"\n\n**Creative Direction — The Opposition Between Ambition and Honesty**\n\nThe creative direction's central tension — \"ambition against honesty\" — is structurally present. The page opens with the complexity ladder (you stand at Level 7), immediately followed by the prerequisites gotcha with two lines in red: the budget warning and the experience requirement. The pull quotes vibrate with industrial-revolution excitement (\"Idea Compiler,\" \"slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels\"), but the gotcha callouts slam the gate repeatedly: \"face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees,\" \"if you have any doubt whatsoever.\"\n\nThe bookend structure works. The crossroads gotcha at Zone 7 echoes the opening prerequisites. Neither feels decorative. The page genuinely feels like standing at the entrance to something powerful, reading both the invitation and the warning simultaneously.\n\n**R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS — Bento Grid for the 8 Roles**\n\nThe 3-column grid for the town-level and rig-level roles is genuinely bento: organized variety within strict structure. Each card has identical anatomy (number, name, function, responsibilities, commands, model recommendation) but the tier-level visual treatment creates hierarchy. Dark headers for town-level roles signal global authority. The human Overseer card with its red header is the most visually weighted card on the entire page — making the reader's identity the loudest element in the architecture diagram. This is a creative choice the research didn't prescribe, and it's exactly right for content that says \"you're not a programmer anymore.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Density Rhythm *Within* Zones**\n\nThe macro density wave (across zones) is deeply integrated, but the micro density rhythm *within* individual zones is relatively uniform. R3 describes PULSE patterns — \"HIGH-LOW-HIGH-LOW cycles, like a heartbeat\" — and the creative direction explicitly asks for this in the infrastructure zone: \"Beads wants layered depth.\" Within the Beads section, though, the rhythm is consistently medium: prose, table, prose, callout, diagram, code block, diagram, quote, callout. Each component is well-placed, but the alternation between dense and sparse *within* the section doesn't pulse. It flows steadily, like a river at constant depth rather than a heartbeat.\n\n**R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS — Cinematic Wide-Close-Wide**\n\nR4's cinematic pattern (establishing shot → close-up → wide shot, mirroring learning: context → detail → synthesis) is referenced in comments but doesn't manifest as a felt experience within individual sections. The Beads section, for instance, could feel like a cinematic sequence — opening with the big-picture \"50 First Dates\" problem (wide), zooming into the architecture diagram and commands (close), then pulling back to \"Why Git as Database?\" (wide synthesis). The content structure supports it, but the visual treatment is uniform throughout, so the zoom effect is conceptual rather than felt.\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY — Component Voices**\n\nR5's framework of component voices (\"Info Callout speaks as a professional concierge,\" \"Essence Callout speaks as a wise archivist\") is honored in the *selection* of callout types but not always in the *writing within* them. The essence callouts genuinely use a different register — Instrument Serif italic, philosophical — which is excellent. But the tip callouts and info callouts sometimes sound interchangeable in their prose. The tip in the government district (\"Crew members are the cheapest way to parallelize work\") reads more like an info callout than a warm colleague sharing wisdom. The distinction exists visually but not always editorially.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Temporal and Interaction Density**\n\nR3 describes six density dimensions, but two are entirely absent from a static HTML page: temporal density (how information unfolds over scroll/time) and interaction density (clickable elements per viewport). These are legitimately absent because the artifact is a single static document with no JavaScript, no scroll-triggered behavior, no expandable sections. This is a reasonable creative choice — the KortAI world's flatness and honesty argue against scroll-triggered reveals. But R3's progressive disclosure recommendations (\"Click Depth 0: 3-5 key facts → Click Depth 1: 10-15 details → Click Depth 2: Full reference\") could have found expression in collapsible sections for the troubleshooting scenarios or the role deep-dives, maintaining flatness while honoring depth density.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Density Transitions (The Gradient Principle)**\n\nR3 states: \"Density should never change ABRUPTLY.

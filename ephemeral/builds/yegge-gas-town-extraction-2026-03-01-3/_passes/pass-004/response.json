Here's the creative reflection:\n\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\n**BUILT:** Zone 5 (Infrastructure, `#F7F2EA`) containing three sections — Beads (Section 04), 6 Waves (Section 05), and Core Principles (Section 06) — connected by heavy subsection dividers (3px border). Zone 6 (Operations, `#FAFAF5`) containing Implementation Guide (Section 07). Six new component types: principle-block (2-zone bounded-thought containers with primary/standard variants), memory-layers (3-tier border-weight gradient visualization: 4px/3px/1px for Hot/Warm/Cold), cost-math (dark monospace economics block), checklist (task-oriented checkbox list), checkpoint (monospace verification markers in green), and subsection-divider (intra-zone topic separators). Zone transitions use breathing transition (3px primary border) from District→Infrastructure, then hard cut (3px standard border) from Infrastructure→Operations. The principle blocks use border-weight gradient: GUPP gets primary-red 4px border with dark header, remaining five principles get standard 3px border with earth-tone headers.\n\n**TRYING:** To make the transition from Zone 4 (the densest room) through Zone 5 into Zone 6 feel like the conviction brief's arc: \"Understanding replaces awe\" → \"The reader's hands get dirty.\" Zone 5 gathers three different epistemological registers — infrastructure (how it works), history (how it got here), constitution (the laws) — into a single zone with subsection dividers marking topic shifts within the same room. The principle-block component treats each principle as a \"bounded thought\" (R5's framing concept), using the 2-zone DNA pattern but adapted: header zone carries the principle name + category tag, body zone carries Yegge's voice + explanation. GUPP's dark header breaks the pattern exactly once, signaling it as the primary law — Kubernetes-style cattle/pets is important but GUPP is constitutional. Zone 6 deliberately shifts to a neutral background (`#FAFAF5`, the lightest non-white in the system) because operations should feel clean, not atmospheric.\n\n**REJECTED:** (1) Bento grid for the 6 Waves tables — considered displaying the two tables side-by-side, but the tables have different column structures (4-col vs 2-col) and the content is sequential (macro waves → personal stages), not parallel. Vertical stacking with an essence callout between them creates better narrative flow. (2) Solid offset depth (Mechanism #3) on the GUPP principle block — would over-dramatize and compete with the pull-quote inside it. The dark header already signals \"this is the most important principle.\" (3) Drop cap on Zone 5 opening — the zone is medium-density explanatory content, not editorial. Drop caps belong in the sparse outskirts zones. (4) Spiral/geological strata for Core Principles — considered since the conviction brief mentions \"laws of physics,\" but principles are PARALLEL (equal in kind, different in domain), not STRATIFIED (layered by depth/certainty). The principle-block sequence treats them as a collection of bounded thoughts, not a depth hierarchy. (5) Architecture diagram for the Memory Model — started drafting it as an `.arch-diagram` ASCII box like the Beads Architecture, but realized the 3-tier memory model communicates better as the `.memory-layers` component with color-coded left borders (Hot=red, Warm=amber, Cold=blue). The border-weight gradient (4px→3px→1px) simultaneously encodes temperature AND access frequency.\n\n**SURPRISED:** The memory-layers component created an unexpected visual echo with the role cards in Zone 4. Both use left-border color encoding (role cards use tier colors, memory layers use temperature colors) with border-weight varying by importance. This wasn't planned — it emerged from applying Mechanism #1 (border-weight gradient) to a different content domain. The two components are structurally different (cards vs layers) but share a visual language that binds the infrastructure zone to the architecture zone. Also surprised by how the checkpoint markers (`gt status should show all roles running`) create a rhythm in the operations zone that feels like the pulse of the complexity ladder from Zone 1 — both use monospace green text as verification signals.\n\n**WANTED:** (1) An interactive memory-layer component where clicking a layer reveals its full contents (progressive disclosure). But JavaScript is prohibited and this is a static page. (2) A visual connection between the 6 Waves table and the 8 Stages table — some kind of annotation or arrow showing \"Wave 6 = Stage 8.\" The `.wave-current` and `.stage-current` row highlighting partially serves this, but a more explicit connection would be clearer. (3) The cost-math block to include a simple bar chart or visual representation of the cost breakdown. Monospace text with label/value pairs is functional but lacks the visual impact that $300/day → $80,000/year deserves.\n\n**UNRESOLVED:** (1) The density transition between Zone 5 (Infrastructure) and Zone 6 (Operations) uses a standard 3px border hard cut. This feels appropriate for the domain shift (philosophy → practice), but the Zone 5 ending (essence callout) and Zone 6 opening (checklist) create a warm→neutral temperature shift that might benefit from a bridge transition with connective prose. (2) The six principle blocks in a row create potential \"card fatigue\" — R5 warns against more than 2 consecutive callouts, and while principle blocks aren't callouts, they share visual weight. The temperature buffers between them (the pull-quotes within each block) partially address this. (3) The startup script code block (32 lines) is the longest single code block on the page so far. It might benefit from line annotations or interleaved comments, but the source material already has good comments and breaking it up would fragment the \"save this as a file\" intent.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: The border-weight gradient mechanism (Mechanism #1) maps to THREE different semantic axes across Zones 4-5: tier importance (role cards: dark/standard/red), memory temperature (layers: 4px hot/3px warm/1px cold), and principle priority (GUPP: primary-red/others: standard). The mechanism is truly metaphor-independent — its meaning changes per context but its perceptual effect (weight = importance) remains constant.\n- Discovery 2: The conviction brief's \"settlement\" metaphor predicted the zone naming before I chose it. \"Infrastructure\" (plumbing), \"History\" (waves), and \"Constitution\" (principles) are governance vocabulary — they naturally extend the \"government district\" Zone 4. The settlement metaphor doesn't just govern spatial layout; it governs the NAMING of each section's relationship to the whole. Section 04 is \"Infrastructure\" (not \"Memory System\"), Section 05 is \"History\" (not \"AI Evolution\"), Section 06 is \"Constitution\" (not \"Design Principles\"). The concept-based naming (from Phase 2.3) flows directly from the metaphor.\n- Discovery 3: R5's combination theory (velocity mismatch rule) explains why the operations zone NEEDS the closing tip callout. The section contains 6 consecutive code blocks (SLOW velocity) — a code wall anti-pattern. The checkpoint markers (FAST velocity) break the wall into phases, but the tip callout at the end provides the temperature shift from utilitarian (cold) to collegial (warm) that prevents the \"anxiety ending\" anti-pattern. The tip's content — \"Your job is to make decisions, not write code\" — also echoes the Zone 3 essence (\"You're not writing code anymore. You're managing a factory\"), creating a philosophical bookend across 5 zones.\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

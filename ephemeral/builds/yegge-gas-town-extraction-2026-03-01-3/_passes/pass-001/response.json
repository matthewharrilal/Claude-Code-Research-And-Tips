  "result": "<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: Three-zone architecture (Outskirts → Gate → Town Square) with full-bleed zone backgrounds, concept-named CSS custom properties (--zone-outskirts, --zone-gate, --zone-square), complete token system designed for the full 13-section page. Header/footer dark bookends with 3px primary border. Complexity ladder in dark monospace container. Comparison grids for before/after states. Pull-quote component for Yegge's voice. Prerequisites as honest gotcha-callout gate. Career table with labeled wrapper. Zone boundaries as hard-cut transitions with 3px borders.\n\nTRYING: The settlement arrival metaphor governing density and atmosphere. Zone 1 (outskirts) is deliberately the sparsest — generous padding, the ladder floating in dark negative space, the TOC as a wayfinding landmark before the road narrows. Zone 2 (gate) is the checkpoint — Yegge's credentials as the guard asking \"should you trust this place?\" The dustier background (#F8F2EA vs #FEF9F5) signals you've crossed a threshold. Zone 3 (town square) is warmer (#FAF5ED), the philosophical center where the colony metaphor lands with full structural weight. The primary-colored zone boundary between gate and square signals this is THE transition — from \"who built this\" to \"what IS this.\"\n\nREJECTED: (1) Bento grid for the TOC — tried it, but the content list is sequential not modular; a two-column ordered list respects the linear journey better. (2) ASCII art for the ant/colony comparison — the conviction brief called it out, but rendered in HTML the comparison-grid panels carry more structural weight than monospace art would. (3) Spiral/geological strata for Zone 1 — the outskirts metaphor demands flatness and openness, not layered depth. Spiral is better suited to the deeper infrastructure zones (Beads, Principles) in later chunks. (4) Solid offset depth (Mechanism #3) on the pull quotes — considered it but decided the 4px red left border is enough emphasis; offset would over-dramatize and compete with the content's own weight.\n\nSURPRISED: The comparison-grid component became the workhorse of the early zones — it handles \"current state vs. after,\" \"traditional vs. Gas Town,\" and the before/after structure naturally. The two-panel grid with one emphasized panel is simple CSS but carries enormous rhetorical weight. Also surprised by how the zone boundary colors work: the 15-20 RGB delta between outskirts (#FEF9F5) and gate (#F8F2EA) is subtle but perceptible, while the gate-to-square boundary gets the 3px primary border to compensate for a smaller color shift.\n\nWANTED: A sticky scroll-witness TOC (Mechanism #8) that highlights the active section — but JavaScript is prohibited and this is chunk 1 where the architectural decisions need to be solid. Also wanted to make the complexity ladder interactive (highlight your current level) but the self-contained constraint prevents it.\n\nUNRESOLVED: The density arc for the full page needs the later zones to validate it — Zone 4 (8 Roles) should be the gravitational peak, the densest room, and the current zone system needs to support that without making the early zones feel too light. The callout modulation system (tighter padding in dense zones) is defined but untested until Zone 4. The transition grammar between zone--square and the upcoming zone--district needs the architecture section to exist before the boundary treatment can be finalized.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: The conviction brief's \"Arrival at a Settlement\" metaphor maps cleanly to the zone background system — outskirts/gate/square aren't just labels, they predict ALL the CSS properties (spacing opens outward, borders thicken inward, backgrounds warm toward the center). Concept-named tokens genuinely predict their own values.\n- Discovery 2: Yegge's pull quotes function as zone-level punctuation — they reset the reader's emotional register at exactly the points where the content shifts from factual to philosophical. The first quote (\"slopping shiny fish\") closes the credentials zone with personality; the \"biggest fuckin' ant\" quote OPENS the mental model zone with force. Their placement is structural, not decorative.\n- Discovery 3: The prerequisites callout using gotcha-styling (coral border, warning background) creates productive tension with the surrounding outskirts zone — it's the only warm-to-cold temperature shift in Zone 1, which makes it impossible to scroll past. R5's temperature theory (neutral zone + cold interrupt = attention) works in practice.\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

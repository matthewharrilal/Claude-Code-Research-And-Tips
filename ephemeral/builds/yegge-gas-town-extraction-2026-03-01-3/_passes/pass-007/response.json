  "result": "The page is complete at 4,681 lines with 10 zone divs spanning the full settlement metaphor from outskirts to archive.\n\n---\n\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: Added Zone 8 (Archive) with `--zone-archive: #F9F6F0` background — a bibliographic room distinct from both the crossroads' warmth and the operations' neutral tone. Five sections within: Sources (organized into Primary Sources with blog/GitHub/podcast/Twitter subcategories, plus Community Extensions table with installation code and a Books reference), Quick Reference (five labeled command groups — Installation, Role Management, Inbox, Town Management, Beads — each as compact syntax-highlighted code blocks), Cost Estimation (two dark monospace cost-math blocks — per-role hourly rates and example daily calculation — followed by a tip callout as temperature buffer), Tags (horizontal monospace tag cloud with 14 items), and Document Metadata (2-zone component: label header + key-value grid). Subsection dividers mark topic shifts within the archive zone: heavy (3px) between Sources and Quick Reference (domain shift), standard (1px) between Quick Reference and Cost, and standard between Cost and Tags. The closing bookend — \"Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant.\" — appears as a centered, italicized Instrument Serif sentence at the bottom of the archive, above a 1px top border, creating structural closure that echoes the epigraph at the page's opening.\n\nTRYING: To make the archive feel like the quietest room in the settlement — the place where you come to file things after the emotional weight of the crossroads decision. The density is deliberately LOW after the crossroads' evaluative density. Sources are organized for scanning, not reading. Quick Reference is pure utility — labeled groups of atomic commands. The cost blocks are honest and unapologetic (the settlement's price list posted at the exit). The tag cloud and metadata close the page with structural bookkeeping — the reader feels the page winding down, not stopping abruptly. The closing bookend's centered alignment (the only centered text on the page) signals finality — it's the last thing you see before the footer's dark mirror.\n\nREJECTED: (1) Putting Sources in the crossroads zone — considered it because sources are part of \"should I stay or go?\" evaluation, but the bibliographic register is fundamentally different from the evaluative register. Sources need their own room. (2) A bento grid layout for the Quick Reference groups — tried mentally to arrange the five command groups in a 2+3 or 3+2 grid, but the commands have varying heights and the bento would create awkward gaps. Vertical stack with labeled groups is more honest to the content's reference nature. (3) Interactive accordion/collapsible sections for each source category — violates no-JavaScript constraint and adds cognitive density to what should be a scannable reference. (4) A separate comparison table for cost estimation (role × hour × model tier) — the existing cost-math dark blocks are more visually striking and match the established code-block family. A table would feel bureaucratic rather than honest. (5) Giving the closing bookend a pull-quote treatment with red left border — it would compete with the pull-quote voice that belongs to Yegge. The closing line is the document speaking, not Yegge, so it gets its own quiet treatment: centered, serif italic, secondary color.\n\nSURPRISED: The tag cloud creates an unexpected visual echo of the model-recommendation badges in Zone 4's role cards. Both use monospace text inside 1px bordered containers — the tags at the bottom feel like metadata descendants of the badges at the structural peak. This creates a subtle structural rhyme: the densest zone (district) and the sparsest zone (archive) share the same atomic visual element (bordered mono text), connecting the page's extremes. Also surprised by how the subsection dividers within the archive zone create a micro-density rhythm that mirrors the zone-boundary system at macro scale — heavy divider (3px) for domain shift, light divider (1px) for topic shift, exactly as zone boundaries use 3px for primary shifts and 1px for internal shifts. The fractal principle holds even in the quietest room.\n\nWANTED: A visual timeline for the community extensions — something showing when each extension emerged relative to Gas Town's release, creating a sense of ecosystem growth. But the source content doesn't include dates for extensions, and inventing data would be editorial overreach. Also wanted to add a \"Further Reading\" callout recommending the progression from this document to the actual installation, but the document metadata already implies this is a self-contained extraction, not a gateway to a tutorial.\n\nUNRESOLVED: The archive zone's background (#F9F6F0) is perceptually close to the infrastructure zone (#F7F2EA) — only 8 RGB delta. In isolation each reads distinctly, but in the scroll flow from crossroads (#FAF6EE) through the 3px zone boundary into archive, the reader may not register the new room as strongly as other zone transitions. A future pass should evaluate whether the archive needs a stronger background differentiation or whether the 3px structural border carries sufficient transition signal. The cost-math blocks contain Unicode box-drawing characters (━) that may not render consistently across all monospace fonts at all sizes — the `--font-mono` stack starts with JetBrains Mono which supports these, but the fallback `SF Mono` coverage is uncertain at 0.8125rem on mobile.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: The archive zone is the only zone on the page that combines BOTH a zone-boundary class (3px structural border) AND a new background color at the same element. Every other zone transition uses either a boundary border OR a background shift — never both simultaneously. The double signal at the archive entry is necessary because the archive follows the crossroads' essence callout, which already served as the emotional closure of the evaluative arc. Without the reinforced transition, the reader might not register that new content follows what felt like an ending.\n- Discovery 2: The Quick Reference section's five command groups (Installation, Role Management, Inbox, Town Management, Beads) create an implicit narrative of the Gas Town lifecycle when read in sequence: install → manage roles → handle communication → oversee town → persist memory. This ordering wasn't specified in the source content (which lists them as flat reference), but the grouping labels create a progression that echoes the 8-role hierarchy from Zone 4. The reference section accidentally teaches the operational flow.\n- Discovery 3: The `.source-desc` spans (secondary color, smaller type, dash-prefixed) within the source list create a 2-zone pattern at the character level: the link text (primary color, standard size) is the label zone, the description (secondary, compressed) is the body zone. This is the R5 2-zone component DNA operating at its smallest possible scale — inside a single list item. The fractal self-similarity holds from page level (zones) through section level (subsections) through component level (callouts) down to character level (link + description).\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

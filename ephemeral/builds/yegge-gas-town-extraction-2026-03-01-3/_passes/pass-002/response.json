DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**The settlement metaphor as structural architecture, not decoration.** The zone system — outskirts (#FEF9F5), gate (#F8F2EA), square (#FAF5ED) — isn't just labeling. The background colors genuinely warm and deepen as you move inward. The creative direction described \"approaching and entering an unfamiliar town,\" and the page delivers this as a reading experience. The dark header feels like an exterior wall. The outskirts TOC feels like seeing the settlement from a ridge. The gate with Yegge's career table feels like a credential checkpoint. The red 3px border between gate and square feels like crossing a threshold into the philosophical center. The metaphor governs room-by-room, not just section-by-section.\n\n**R5's component family DNA is structurally present, not just color-coded.** The callout family (gotcha, essence, tip, info) all share the same two-zone anatomy — uppercase monospace label above, body text below, 4px left border accent. R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md calls this \"Family Cohesion Through Shared DNA\" and describes the \"same zone structure (label + body + left accent), same spacing rhythm.\" The builder honored this. The gotcha callout in the prerequisites and the essence callout in the Town Square are clearly siblings — same skeleton, different emotional register. The essence callout speaks in Instrument Serif italic (the system's deepest voice), which is a genuine character differentiation, not just a color swap.\n\n**The opposition from the creative direction — ambition against honesty — lands.** The creative direction's central tension (\"the thrill of what becomes possible AND the seriousness of what it demands\") is structurally embodied. Zone 1 presents the comparison grid where the right panel (red-bordered, \"After This Document\") vibrates with ambition: \"Understand the factory-scale agent architecture.\" Immediately below, the gotcha callout slams the gate: \"Budget: $50-200/day\" and \"100+ hours experience\" are rendered in the primary red, weight 500. This is the creative direction's \"feeling the heat from the refinery, reading the sign that says you must be this tall to ride.\" The builder didn't just include both poles — they placed them in direct confrontation within the same viewport.\n\n**Pull-quote interruption as mechanism, not decoration.** R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md identifies pull-quotes as a \"mechanism affinity\" for Yegge's voice — \"profane, vivid, and philosophically charged... natural editorial interruptions that reset the reader's emotional register.\" Three pull-quotes appear in Zones 2 and 3, each in Instrument Serif italic at 1.375rem with a red left border. They genuinely interrupt the editorial register. The \"slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels\" quote in Zone 2 arrives after the measured, professional career table and credential list — it jolts. Yegge's voice breaks through the page's composed authority. This is not a blockquote — it's a character speaking.\n\n**R5's setup-payoff sequencing governs Zone 2.** The combination theory describes a \"Classic Pattern: Context → Map → Principle → Demonstration → Action → Hazards.\" Zone 2 follows this: career table (context/map) → numbered credentials (principle — why trust matters) → vibe coding philosophy + pull-quote (demonstration). The creative direction said \"compact but authoritative\" for the credentials zone, and the builder compressed Yegge's career into a labeled table, his credibility into five numbered assertions, and his philosophy into a single pull-quote. This is editorial compression — the R3 concept of high semantic density serving experts.\n\n**R3's temporal density CRESCENDO from page opening.** The page opens at its sparsest — an epigraph floating in cream whitespace — then introduces the TOC (medium structure), then the complexity ladder (first dense landmark in dark monospace), then the comparison grid (two-panel structure), then the prerequisites callout (emotionally dense). Each component is denser than the last. This isn't accidental — it maps directly to R3's CRESCENDO pattern: \"Builds from sparse to dense. Best for: Onboarding, complexity reveals.\" The reader is being onboarded into a complexity reveal.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**R4 axis pattern references in comments without structural realization.** The HTML comments mention \"Z-pattern adapted\" for the comparison grids and \"Hub-and-spoke navigation adapted to linear scroll\" for the TOC. But the TOC is a simple two-column grid with numbered links — there is no hub-and-spoke dynamic where the reader returns to a central navigation point. The comparison grids are flat side-by-side panels — the eye doesn't sweep diagonally. The builder knew the vocabulary but the structures would be identical without having read R4.\n\n**DD-006 mechanism numbers in CSS comments as annotation, not structure.** Comments reference \"Mechanism #2,\" \"Mechanism #7,\" \"Mechanism #10,\" \"Mechanism #13,\" \"Mechanism #17.\" These are catalog references from the fractal density case study. But the actual CSS doesn't show cross-scale self-similarity — the fractal case study's core insight. Dense/sparse alternation exists at the zone level but not within individual components. The mechanism numbers are provenance markers, not evidence of structural adoption.\n\n**Zone boundary borders as default pattern, not tension-derived choice.** R3 discusses both hard cuts and gradual transitions (\"Density should never change ABRUPTLY... Transitions need gradients\"). The builder uses 3px borders between every zone. Only the red border between Gate and Square feels intentional — marking the philosophical threshold. The gray border between Outskirts and Gate feels like a default divider rather than a considered density transition. The choice to use hard cuts everywhere may be correct for this content's decisive tone, but it reads as a habit rather than a decision.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**R3's breathing framework within zones.** The research describes pages that breathe — \"alternating inhalation (drawing attention in) and exhalation (releasing attention)\" — at every structural scale. Between zones, the page breathes. Within zones, it does not. Zone 3 (Town Square) stacks: pull-quote → prose → comparison grid → heading → prose → table → heading → pull-quote → prose → essence callout → heading → prose → reference list. That is thirteen elements with no deliberate exhalation. The creative direction calls this \"the page's philosophical center\" — a place where the core insight should land with force and then be absorbed. But the force is continuous rather than rhythmic. The pull-quote about the \"biggest fuckin' ant\" deserves silence after it.\n\n**R3's density contrast as relative perception.** Finding R3-029: \"Density is RELATIVE. A medium-density element feels dense after sparse content, sparse after dense content.\" The zones shift background color to signal density change, but the component density within zones is uniform enough that you don't experience the contrast effect. Zone 1 (outskirts) contains an epigraph, a full TOC, a code block, a comparison grid, and a callout — which is surprisingly populated for a zone labeled \"sparse, orienting.\" The creative direction imagined \"Low density. Generous whitespace.\" The whitespace between zones exists, but the outskirts themselves are already a small town.\n\n**The drop cap — defined but never placed.** The CSS prepares a beautiful editorial signal: a 3.5em Instrument Serif first-letter in red, floating left. It appears nowhere in the HTML. The research on \"breaking rhythm for impact\" (R4) says \"a disruption in established rhythm demands attention.\" After two zones of consistent paragraph openings, a drop cap at the philosophical center would be precisely that disruption. This mechanism was studied, prepared, and then left in the toolkit unused.\n\n**Interaction d",

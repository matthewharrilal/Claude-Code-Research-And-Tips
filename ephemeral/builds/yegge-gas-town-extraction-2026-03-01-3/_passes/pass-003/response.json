All zones are properly nested, the NEXT_CHUNK marker is in place for chunk 3, and the HTML closes cleanly.\n\n---\n\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: Zone 4 — the Government District — as the page's gravitational center. The zone lives in `--zone-district` (#F5F0E8) with compressed padding (48px vs 64px/80px in other zones). Two dark monospace architecture diagrams (hierarchy + communication flow) serve as the zone's visual bookends, rendered in the same `.arch-diagram` container family as the complexity ladder from Zone 1. Eight role cards organized in a 3-tier bento structure: Town Level (Mayor/Deacon/Dogs) in a 3-column grid with dark headers signaling global authority; Rig Level (Refinery/Polecat/Witness) in a 3-column grid with standard borders signaling project scope; Worker Level (Crew) in a half-width grid paired with a tip callout as temperature buffer; Human Level (Overseer) as a full-width card with primary-red header and 2-column body grid. Border-weight gradient encodes tier importance: primary (#E83025) for zone transitions and human level, dark (#1A1A1A) for town-level card headers, standard border (#E0D5C5) for rig-level. Model recommendation badges use color-encoded compact badges (red=Opus, blue=Sonnet, green=Haiku). Syntax highlighting on both ASCII diagrams: red for tier labels, function-blue for role names, string-green for human elements.\n\nTRYING: To make the densest zone on the page feel like seeing a city layout from elevation — complex but organized, every building with a purpose. The bento grid approach treats each role card as a building in the district, with the tier labels as street signs. The dark-header differentiation between town-level and rig-level cards creates an immediate visual hierarchy without requiring the reader to read the labels. The Crew + tip callout pairing is a deliberate density-debt payment after six consecutive heavy role cards — R5's temperature buffer principle in practice. The Overseer card's red header makes it impossible to scroll past — it's the only primary-color card in the entire grid, signaling \"this is about YOU.\" The closing essence callout (\"eight jurisdictions, not eight programs\") transitions the reader from architectural density back to philosophical understanding before the zone boundary.\n\nREJECTED: (1) Full ASCII box-drawing characters (╔═══╗ outer border) for the hierarchy diagram — the HTML container already provides a visible 3px border frame, making the ASCII outer box redundant and fighting with the CSS border. Stripped to internal structure only. (2) Varying card sizes within tiers (2-column Mayor + 1-column Deacon/Dogs) — tried it mentally but the 3-column grid where all town-level roles have equal visual weight better communicates \"one instance each, equally important.\" The bento variety comes from BETWEEN tiers (3-col → 3-col → 2-col → full-width), not within them. (3) Separate `.hierarchy-diagram` and `.comm-flow` CSS classes — unified them into `.arch-diagram` since they share identical styling, just different content. (4) Drop cap on the opening paragraph — the district is too dense for editorial flourish; drop caps belong in the sparse opening zones. (5) Info callout at the top of the section (\"This section is the densest...\") — meta-commentary about density violates the principle of showing rather than telling.\n\nSURPRISED: The model recommendation badges create an unexpected secondary visual rhythm across the role cards. When you scan the cards quickly, the red/blue/green/blue/blue/green/green pattern forms a heat map of computational cost: expensive (Opus) roles cluster at the coordination and decomposition points, cheap (Haiku) roles cluster at the monitoring and labor points. This wasn't designed — it emerged from the content's own logic. Also surprised by how the Overseer pull-quote (\"That's you, Human\") functions as an emotional hinge. After seven cards of system architecture, Yegge's direct address jolts the reader back to personal identification. The pull-quote is doing double duty: paying density debt AND transforming the section from \"here's how the system works\" to \"here's where you fit in it.\"\n\nWANTED: A sticky navigation sidebar showing which tier the reader is currently viewing (Mechanism #8 — Scroll Witness). The 8 role cards are long enough that the reader loses position context. But JavaScript is prohibited and sticky positioning within a complex zone creates responsive complications. Also wanted to use solid offset depth (Mechanism #3) on the Overseer card to make it physically \"pop\" — but decided the primary-red header is sufficient emphasis, and offset would compete with the card content rather than complement it.\n\nUNRESOLVED: The density transition between Zone 4 (district) and whatever follows in Zone 5 needs careful treatment. Zone 4 is the densest room on the page — the exit boundary needs significant decompression. A breathing transition (80px + 3px structural border) is likely necessary, but the exact treatment depends on what Zone 5 contains (Beads, Waves, Principles). The callout modulation system (`.zone--district .callout` with tighter padding) is now live and tested with the tip callout and essence callout in Zone 4 — they render at 16px/24px padding vs the standard 24px/32px. Whether this compression is perceptually sufficient needs verification in the browser. The hierarchy diagram's horizontal width may clip on narrow viewports even with `overflow-x: auto` — the ASCII art is ~62 characters wide, which needs ~520px at 14px monospace, safe at 768px but tight at 480px where font-size drops to 0.75rem (~420px needed).\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: The border-weight gradient (Mechanism #1) maps naturally onto the Gas Town governance hierarchy. Town-level = dark (#1A1A1A) borders because they're global authority. Rig-level = standard (#E0D5C5) borders because they're project-scoped. Human-level = primary (#E83025) because you are the most important thing in the system. This wasn't imposed — the content's own hierarchy demanded exactly the border weights the design system provides. The mechanism and the metaphor converged independently.\n- Discovery 2: The model recommendation badges (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) create a cost-topology that mirrors the hierarchy diagram's structural topology. The most expensive models (Opus) appear at coordination chokepoints (Mayor, Refinery). The cheapest (Haiku) appear at high-throughput, low-reasoning positions (Deacon, Witness, Crew). This is the content teaching through its own structure — the reader absorbs the cost model without needing a separate cost table, because the badge colors in the bento grid create a visual map of where computational money flows.\n- Discovery 3: R5's temperature buffer principle (inserting a warm/light callout between heavy components) works differently in a bento grid than in a vertical stack. In vertical layout, a tip callout creates temporal breathing room — you scroll past the heavy thing, encounter lightness, then continue. In a bento grid, the tip callout creates SPATIAL breathing room — the Crew card and the tip callout sit side-by-side, and the empty visual weight of the callout contrasts with the dense role card to its left. The same R5 principle, applied in a different axis pattern (bento vs F-pattern), produces a different perceptual effect: temporal relief vs spatial relief.\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

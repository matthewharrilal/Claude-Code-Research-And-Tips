(2) Varying the pull-quote border color by theme in Section 11 — considered using amber for philosophical quotes, green for practical, coral for warnings — but the uniform red border maintains Yegge's voice as ONE voice regardless of topic, which is the right editorial decision. (3) A drop-cap opening on Section 10 — the crossroads zone should feel open and direct, not editorial. Drop caps signal \"begin a journey\" and we're ending one. (4) Putting sections 8-9 inside the same zone div as Section 7 (implementation) rather than a new operations zone div — but the existing zone closed before the NEXT_CHUNK marker, and reopening it would require restructuring the previous chunk.

This wasn't designed — it emerged from the combination of monospace numbering + coral color + left-aligned header position. Also surprised by how the decision columns (Section 10) rhyme visually with the comparison-grid panels from Zone 3 (the ant/colony comparison). Both are 2-column grids with semantically differentiated borders. The reader unconsciously recognizes the pattern: \"I'm comparing two things\" — but in Zone 3 it was abstract philosophy and here it's concrete self-assessment. Same component DNA, different knowledge state. The closing essence callout (\"Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant\") genuinely does resonate differently after 3000+ lines of architecture, infrastructure, operations, and diagnostics. At the top, it was a clever turn of phrase. At the bottom, it's a summary of everything the reader now understands.",

But this would break the pull-quote's max-width: 55ch constraint and change its reading rhythm. The next pass should evaluate whether the quote density feels right in the browser. The comparison tables in Section 12 are dense reference content at the end of a sparse zone — the density contrast is intentional (a \"last look back\") but might feel abrupt.

    "Discovery 1: The conviction brief's \"Arrival at a Settlement\" metaphor maps cleanly to the zone background system — outskirts/gate/square aren't just labels, they predict ALL the CSS properties (spacing opens outward, borders thicken inward, backgrounds warm toward the center). Concept-named tokens genuinely predict their own values.",
    "Discovery 2: Yegge's pull quotes function as zone-level punctuation — they reset the reader's emotional register at exactly the points where the content shifts from factual to philosophical. The first quote (\"slopping shiny fish\") closes the credentials zone with personality; the \"biggest fuckin' ant\" quote OPENS the mental model zone with force. Their placement is structural, not decorative.",
    "Discovery 3: The prerequisites callout using gotcha-styling (coral border, warning background) creates productive tension with the surrounding outskirts zone — it's the only warm-to-cold temperature shift in Zone 1, which makes it impossible to scroll past. R5's temperature theory (neutral zone + cold interrupt = attention) works in practice.",
    "Discovery 1: The border-weight gradient (Mechanism #1) maps naturally onto the Gas Town governance hierarchy. Town-level = dark (#1A1A1A) borders because they're global authority. Rig-level = standard (#E0D5C5) borders because they're project-scoped. Human-level = primary (#E83025) because you are the most important thing in the system. This wasn't imposed — the content's own hierarchy demanded exactly the border weights the design system provides. The mechanism and the metaphor converged independently.",
    "Discovery 2: The model recommendation badges (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) create a cost-topology that mirrors the hierarchy diagram's structural topology. The most expensive models (Opus) appear at coordination chokepoints (Mayor, Refinery). The cheapest (Haiku) appear at high-throughput, low-reasoning positions (Deacon, Witness, Crew). This is the content teaching through its own structure — the reader absorbs the cost model without needing a separate cost table, because the badge colors in the bento grid create a visual map of where computational money flows.",
    "Discovery 3: R5's temperature buffer principle (inserting a warm/light callout between heavy components) works differently in a bento grid than in a vertical stack. In vertical layout, a tip callout creates temporal breathing room — you scroll past the heavy thing, encounter lightness, then continue. In a bento grid, the tip callout creates SPATIAL breathing room — the Crew card and the tip callout sit side-by-side, and the empty visual weight of the callout contrasts with the dense role card to its left. The same R5 principle, applied in a different axis pattern (bento vs F-pattern), produces a different perceptual effect: temporal relief vs spatial relief.",
    "Discovery 1: The border-weight gradient mechanism (Mechanism #1) maps to THREE different semantic axes across Zones 4-5: tier importance (role cards: dark/standard/red), memory temperature (layers: 4px hot/3px warm/1px cold), and principle priority (GUPP: primary-red/others: standard). The mechanism is truly metaphor-independent — its meaning changes per context but its perceptual effect (weight = importance) remains constant.",
    "Discovery 2: The conviction brief's \"settlement\" metaphor predicted the zone naming before I chose it. \"Infrastructure\" (plumbing), \"History\" (waves), and \"Constitution\" (principles) are governance vocabulary — they naturally extend the \"government district\" Zone 4. The settlement metaphor doesn't just govern spatial layout; it governs the NAMING of each section's relationship to the whole. Section 04 is \"Infrastructure\" (not \"Memory System\"), Section 05 is \"History\" (not \"AI Evolution\"), Section 06 is \"Constitution\" (not \"Design Principles\"). The concept-based naming (from Phase 2.3) flows directly from the metaphor.",
    "Discovery 3: R5's combination theory (velocity mismatch rule) explains why the operations zone NEEDS the closing tip callout. The section contains 6 consecutive code blocks (SLOW velocity) — a code wall anti-pattern. The checkpoint markers (FAST velocity) break the wall into phases, but the tip callout at the end provides the temperature shift from utilitarian (cold) to collegial (warm) that prevents the \"anxiety ending\" anti-pattern. The tip's content — \"Your job is to make decisions, not write code\" — also echoes the Zone 3 essence (\"You're not writing code anymore. You're managing a factory\"), creating a philosophical bookend across 5 zones.",
    "Discovery 1: The archive zone is the only zone on the page that combines BOTH a zone-boundary class (3px structural border) AND a new background color at the same element. Every other zone transition uses either a boundary border OR a background shift — never both simultaneously. The double signal at the archive entry is necessary because the archive follows the crossroads' essence callout, which already served as the emotional closure of the evaluative arc. Without the reinforced transition, the reader might not register that new content follows what felt like an ending.",
    "Discovery 2: The Quick Reference section's five command groups (Installation, Role Management, Inbox, Town Management, Beads) create an implicit narrative of the Gas Town lifecycle when read in sequence: install → manage roles → handle communication → oversee town → persist memory. This ordering wasn't specified in the source content (which lists them as flat reference), but the grouping labels create a progression that echoes the 8-role hierarchy from Zone 4. The reference section accidentally teaches the operational flow.",
    "Discovery 3: The `.source-desc` spans (secondary color, smaller type, dash-prefixed) within the source list create a 2-zone pattern at the character level: the link text (primary color, standard size) is the label zone, the description (secondary, compressed) is the body zone. This is the R5 2-zone component DNA operating at its smallest possible scale — inside a single list item. The fractal self-similarity holds from page level (zones) through section level (subsections) through component level (callouts) down to character level (link + description)."

    "## Observations\n\n### 1. DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**The settlement metaphor as structural architecture, not decoration.** The zone system — outskirts (#FEF9F5), gate (#F8F2EA), square (#FAF5ED) — isn't just labeling. The background colors genuinely warm and deepen as you move inward. The creative direction described \"approaching and entering an unfamiliar town,\" and the page delivers this as a reading experience. The dark header feels like an exterior wall. The outskirts TOC feels like seeing the settlement from a ridge. The gate with Yegge's career table feels like a credential checkpoint. The red 3px border between gate and square feels like crossing a threshold into the philosophical center. The metaphor governs room-by-room, not just section-by-section.\n\n**R5's component family DNA is structurally present, not just color-coded.** The callout family (gotcha, essence, tip, info) all share the same two-zone anatomy — uppercase monospace label above, body text below, 4px left border accent. R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md calls this \"Family Cohesion Through Shared DNA\" and describes the \"same zone structure (label + body + left accent), same spacing rhythm.\" The builder honored this. The gotcha callout in the prerequisites and the essence callout in the Town Square are clearly siblings — same skeleton, different emotional register. The essence callout speaks in Instrument Serif italic (the system's deepest voice), which is a genuine character differentiation, not just a color swap.\n\n**The opposition from the creative direction — ambition against honesty — lands.** The creative direction's central tension (\"the thrill of what becomes possible AND the seriousness of what it demands\") is structurally embodied. Zone 1 presents the comparison grid where the right panel (red-bordered, \"After This Document\") vibrates with ambition: \"Understand the factory-scale agent architecture.\" Immediately below, the gotcha callout slams the gate: \"Budget: $50-200/day\" and \"100+ hours experience\" are rendered in the primary red, weight 500. This is the creative direction's \"feeling the heat from the refinery, reading the sign that says you must be this tall to ride.\" The builder didn't just include both poles — they placed them in direct confrontation within the same viewport.\n\n**Pull-quote interruption as mechanism, not decoration.** R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md identifies pull-quotes as a \"mechanism affinity\" for Yegge's voice — \"profane, vivid, and philosophically charged... natural editorial interruptions that reset the reader's emotional register.\" Three pull-quotes appear in Zones 2 and 3, each in Instrument Serif italic at 1.375rem with a red left border. They genuinely interrupt the editorial register. The \"slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels\" quote in Zone 2 arrives after the measured, professional career table and credential list — it jolts. Yegge's voice breaks through the page's composed authority. This is not a blockquote — it's a character speaking.\n\n**R5's setup-payoff sequencing governs Zone 2.** The combination theory describes a \"Classic Pattern: Context → Map → Principle → Demonstration → Action → Hazards.\" Zone 2 follows this: career table (context/map) → numbered credentials (principle — why trust matters) → vibe coding philosophy + pull-quote (demonstration). The creative direction said \"compact but authoritative\" for the credentials zone, and the builder compressed Yegge's career into a labeled table, his credibility into five numbered assertions, and his philosophy into a single pull-quote. This is editorial compression — the R3 concept of high semantic density serving experts.\n\n**R3's temporal density CRESCENDO from page opening.** The page opens at its sparsest — an epigraph floating in cream whitespace — then introduces the TOC (medium structure), then the complexity ladder (first dense landmark in dark monospace), then the comparison grid (two-panel structure), then the prerequisites callout (emotionally dense). Each component is denser than the last. This isn't accidental — it maps directly to R3's CRESCENDO pattern: \"Builds from sparse to dense. Best for: Onboarding, complexity reveals.\" The reader is being onboarded into a complexity reveal.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**R4 axis pattern references in comments without structural realization.** The HTML comments mention \"Z-pattern adapted\" for the comparison grids and \"Hub-and-spoke navigation adapted to linear scroll\" for the TOC. But the TOC is a simple two-column grid with numbered links — there is no hub-and-spoke dynamic where the reader returns to a central navigation point. The comparison grids are flat side-by-side panels — the eye doesn't sweep diagonally. The builder knew the vocabulary but the structures would be identical without having read R4.\n\n**DD-006 mechanism numbers in CSS comments as annotation, not structure.** Comments reference \"Mechanism #2,\" \"Mechanism #7,\" \"Mechanism #10,\" \"Mechanism #13,\" \"Mechanism #17.\" These are catalog references from the fractal density case study. But the actual CSS doesn't show cross-scale self-similarity — the fractal case study's core insight. Dense/sparse alternation exists at the zone level but not within individual components. The mechanism numbers are provenance markers, not evidence of structural adoption.\n\n**Zone boundary borders as default pattern, not tension-derived choice.** R3 discusses both hard cuts and gradual transitions (\"Density should never change ABRUPTLY... Transitions need gradients\"). The builder uses 3px borders between every zone. Only the red border between Gate and Square feels intentional — marking the philosophical threshold. The gray border between Outskirts and Gate feels like a default divider rather than a considered density transition. The choice to use hard cuts everywhere may be correct for this content's decisive tone, but it reads as a habit rather than a decision.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**R3's breathing framework within zones.** The research describes pages that breathe — \"alternating inhalation (drawing attention in) and exhalation (releasing attention)\" — at every structural scale. Between zones, the page breathes. Within zones, it does not. Zone 3 (Town Square) stacks: pull-quote → prose → comparison grid → heading → prose → table → heading → pull-quote → prose → essence callout → heading → prose → reference list. That is thirteen elements with no deliberate exhalation. The creative direction calls this \"the page's philosophical center\" — a place where the core insight should land with force and then be absorbed. But the force is continuous rather than rhythmic. The pull-quote about the \"biggest fuckin' ant\" deserves silence after it.\n\n**R3's density contrast as relative perception.** Finding R3-029: \"Density is RELATIVE. A medium-density element feels dense after sparse content, sparse after dense content.\" The zones shift background color to signal density change, but the component density within zones is uniform enough that you don't experience the contrast effect. Zone 1 (outskirts) contains an epigraph, a full TOC, a code block, a comparison grid, and a callout — which is surprisingly populated for a zone labeled \"sparse, orienting.\" The creative direction imagined \"Low density. Generous whitespace.\" The whitespace between zones exists, but the outskirts themselves are already a small town.\n\n**The drop cap — defined but never placed.** The CSS prepares a beautiful editorial signal: a 3.5em Instrument Serif first-letter in red, floating left. It appears nowhere in the HTML. The research on \"breaking rhythm for impact\" (R4) says \"a disruption in established rhythm demands attention.\" After two zones of consistent paragraph openings, a drop cap at the philosophical center would be precisely that disruption. This mechanism was studied, prepared, and then left in the toolkit unused.\n\n**Interaction d",
    "### 1. DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**The settlement metaphor is load-bearing, not decorative.** The creative direction asked for a page structured like approaching an unfamiliar town — sparse outskirts, a checkpoint gate, a town square, a dense government district. This builder didn't just name the zones; they built rooms that feel different to stand in. The outskirts breathe. The gate tightens with the career table. The government district is genuinely heavy — you feel the weight of eight role cards pressing against each other in their bento grids. When the infrastructure zone opens up afterward, you feel relief. That relief is earned, not accidental. The density wave the Research Synthesis (Principle 1: Density as Rhythm) describes — HIGH→LOW→HIGH cycles — is operating at the zone level, and you can feel it in your body as you scroll.\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md shaped the component choreography.** The two-callout limit (Finding T4) is respected everywhere. After six consecutive role cards — the densest stretch on the page — a Tip callout appears as a temperature buffer (Principle T3: Semantic Dissonance prevention). The Essence callouts close heavy sections, which directly implements the density debt concept from R3 (Insight 30). The pull-quotes interrupt the editorial register at structurally motivated moments, not randomly. The \"50 First Dates\" quote opens the Beads section, the \"biggest fuckin' ant\" quote opens the Town Square, the \"Idea Compiler\" quote deepens the Town Square — each appears where R5's \"Setup-Payoff Arc\" (Principle S1) says a principle statement or demonstration should land. This isn't citation; it's structural instinct.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md governs the memory layer visualization.** The Beads three-tier model (hot/warm/cold context) is translated into three simultaneous visual encoding channels: border weight (4px hot, 3px warm, 1px cold — R1's border-weight gradient), background color (coral warmth for hot, amber for warm, blue for cold), and header color. Three channels encoding one concept. This directly implements R3's geological model (Insight 5: surface/sediment/bedrock layers) and the synthesis principle that density should be encoded through multiple dimensions simultaneously. A builder who hadn't read R3 deeply would have made three identically-bordered boxes with different labels.\n\n**R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS.md's bento grid pattern structures the government district.** The role cards are organized in 3-column grids for same-tier roles, 2-column for the worker level, and full-width for the Overseer. This matches R4's prescription: \"Large cells signal importance (big box = big deal).\" The Overseer card is the widest. The town-level cards have dark headers signaling global authority; the rig-level cards have standard headers; the Overseer card has a red header. This tier-differentiation system isn't in any single research file — it emerges from understanding R4's bento grid, R5's component moods, and the content's hierarchical structure simultaneously.\n\n**The creative direction's central tension — ambition against honesty — is held throughout.** The pull-quotes vibrate with industrial excitement (\"Idea Compiler,\" \"slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels\"). Then the Gotcha callout about superintelligent chimpanzees slams the gate shut. The cost math block renders Yegge's spending ($300/day, $80,000/year) in monospace against dark background — the numbers land harder in that typography, which is exactly what the creative direction means by \"feeling the heat from the refinery.\" Neither pole wins. The page doesn't become a sales pitch or a warning label.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**Zone background differentiation exists but is nearly invisible.** The CSS defines five zone backgrounds (`#FEF9F5`, `#F8F2EA`, `#FAF5ED`, `#F5F0E8`, `#F7F2EA`) that differ by such small increments they're essentially imperceptible on screen. R3's zone background differentiation mechanism (Mechanism #7) calls for backgrounds that encode settlement distance — but the encoding here is so faint that the transitions rely entirely on the 3px border boundaries between zones. The zone system works because of the borders, not because of the backgrounds. The backgrounds are technically present but experientially absent.\n\n**The CSS comments reference mechanism numbers extensively** — `/* R1: Border-weight gradient (Mechanism #1) */`, `/* R5: Temperature buffer */`, `/* R3: density debt payment */` — and many of these are genuine structural decisions. But some comments describe what any competent builder would have done without the research. The career table wrapped in a 3px border doesn't need a mechanism citation to justify its existence. The comments sometimes feel like provenance documentation rather than evidence of influence.\n\n**The drop-cap class is defined in CSS but never deployed in the HTML.** The creative direction doesn't explicitly call for drop caps, but the builder defined `.drop-cap::first-letter` with a 3.5em Instrument Serif initial in primary red. It sits unused. This might have been powerful at the opening of the Town Square section — the first body text after the core \"ant\" quote — where an editorial opening signal could mark the moment the reader enters the philosophical center.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**The page is incomplete — sections 8-13 are missing.** The `<!-- NEXT_CHUNK -->` marker after the Implementation Guide means the creative arc's resolution phase is entirely absent. The creative direction specifically describes Zone 7 as \"sparse, resolving\" — the decision matrix, the comparison tables, the closing quote that resonates differently after everything the reader has absorbed. Without this, the page currently builds to the operations zone and then stops mid-sentence. The emotional arc has no payoff. This is the most significant absence, though it's clearly intentional chunking rather than oversight.\n\n**R4's cinematic patterns are not deployed.** The wide-close-wide rhythm (establishing shot → close-up → wide shot) described in R4 Section 3.2 would serve the teaching sections well — particularly the Beads section, which moves from the \"50 First Dates\" problem (establishing shot) directly into technical details (close-up) without ever pulling back to a synthesis moment (wide shot). The section ends with a Tip callout about Git advantages, but there's no moment of \"here's what we just understood and why it matters.\" This is also missing from the Core Principles section, which presents six principles sequentially without a synthesis moment between the first three and the last three.\n\n**R3's fractal self-similarity is absent at the component level.** The page has good macro-level rhythm (zone to zone), but within individual components the pacing is uniform. Every role card has identical internal anatomy: header → function label → responsibility list → commands → model recommendation. Every principle block has identical anatomy: header → quote → explanation → list. DD-006 describes fractal density as \"the same rhythm visible at every zoom level.\" At the component zoom level, these cards are metronomic rather than rhythmic. This isn't a failure — the uniformity creates scanability in the dense government district — but it means the fractal dimension is only operating at two of the four possible scales (page, section) rather than all four.\n\n**R5's \"Teaching Moment\" sequence** (Essence → Core Abstraction → Code → Tip) is never deployed. This matters less for an extraction/reference document than it would for a tutorial, but the Beads section would have been a natural fit: the \"50 First Dates\" problem could serve as the Essence moment, the architecture diagram as the Core Abstraction, the commands as the Code, and the Git advantages as the Tip. The components are all present — they're just not sequenced in the research-prescribed teaching order.\n\n---\n\n### 4. SURPRISED\n\n*",
    "## Observations\n\n### 1. DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY — Temperature Management and Anti-Pattern Discipline**\n\nThis is the deepest integration in the artifact. The builder has internalized R5's temperature model (warm/neutral/cold) and velocity mismatch rule to a degree that feels instinctive rather than applied. After six consecutive role cards in the government district — the densest sequence on the entire page — a tip callout appears beside the seventh card (Crew), and you can *feel* the density debt being paid. It doesn't feel like someone checking a box. It feels like someone who understood that readers need to exhale after absorbing six dense structures.\n\nThe anxiety-ending anti-pattern (R5 A7) is avoided everywhere. Troubleshooting, which is the most anxiety-inducing section by nature, closes with a warm tip: \"Most failures recover with a soft reset.\" The crossroads gotcha is followed by the earned essence callout. Every section resolves rather than abandons the reader.\n\nThe 2-callout limit from R5 Principle T4 is honored throughout. I cannot find a single instance of three consecutive callouts. This discipline is invisible to a reader who hasn't read the research — they just feel that the page *breathes correctly*. That invisibility is the mark of deep integration.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Zone Background Differentiation and Density Wave**\n\nThe zone system is not decoration. The creative direction prescribed a settlement approach — outskirts to gate to town square to government district — and the builder has mapped this to a background color progression that genuinely encodes settlement distance. The outskirts (#FEF9F5) feels like open air. The district (#F5F0E8) feels like stone. The crossroads (#FAF6EE) opens back up. You don't need to read the hex values to feel this — the page gets earthier and denser as you approach the architecture, then releases as you move toward decision.\n\nR3's WAVE density pattern is structurally present in the page's overall arc: sparse opening, building through credentials, peaking at the 8 roles bento grid, decompressing through Beads and principles, rebuilding through operations, and resolving sparse at the crossroads. This isn't a single crescendo — it's a wave with a genuine crest and trough, which is harder to build than a simple ramp.\n\n**DD-006-fractal — Border-Weight Gradient Encoding (Mechanism #1)**\n\nThe memory layer visualization for Beads is where DD-006's border-weight gradient mechanism sings most clearly. Hot context gets a 4-pixel left border in red. Warm context gets a 3-pixel border in amber. Cold context gets a 1-pixel border in blue. The builder didn't copy fractal's \"same pattern at all scales\" — they correctly extracted the *reusable mechanism* (border weight encodes priority) while ignoring the metaphor-specific structure. This distinction is precisely what DD-006's \"What YOU Extract\" section demands, and the builder honored it.\n\nThe tier labels in the government district also use border-weight differentiation: town-level gets the red bottom border, rig-level gets black, worker-level gets grey. Authority is encoded in weight without any text needing to say \"this tier is more important.\"\n\n**Creative Direction — The Opposition Between Ambition and Honesty**\n\nThe creative direction's central tension — \"ambition against honesty\" — is structurally present. The page opens with the complexity ladder (you stand at Level 7), immediately followed by the prerequisites gotcha with two lines in red: the budget warning and the experience requirement. The pull quotes vibrate with industrial-revolution excitement (\"Idea Compiler,\" \"slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels\"), but the gotcha callouts slam the gate repeatedly: \"face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees,\" \"if you have any doubt whatsoever.\"\n\nThe bookend structure works. The crossroads gotcha at Zone 7 echoes the opening prerequisites. Neither feels decorative. The page genuinely feels like standing at the entrance to something powerful, reading both the invitation and the warning simultaneously.\n\n**R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS — Bento Grid for the 8 Roles**\n\nThe 3-column grid for the town-level and rig-level roles is genuinely bento: organized variety within strict structure. Each card has identical anatomy (number, name, function, responsibilities, commands, model recommendation) but the tier-level visual treatment creates hierarchy. Dark headers for town-level roles signal global authority. The human Overseer card with its red header is the most visually weighted card on the entire page — making the reader's identity the loudest element in the architecture diagram. This is a creative choice the research didn't prescribe, and it's exactly right for content that says \"you're not a programmer anymore.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Density Rhythm *Within* Zones**\n\nThe macro density wave (across zones) is deeply integrated, but the micro density rhythm *within* individual zones is relatively uniform. R3 describes PULSE patterns — \"HIGH-LOW-HIGH-LOW cycles, like a heartbeat\" — and the creative direction explicitly asks for this in the infrastructure zone: \"Beads wants layered depth.\" Within the Beads section, though, the rhythm is consistently medium: prose, table, prose, callout, diagram, code block, diagram, quote, callout. Each component is well-placed, but the alternation between dense and sparse *within* the section doesn't pulse. It flows steadily, like a river at constant depth rather than a heartbeat.\n\n**R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS — Cinematic Wide-Close-Wide**\n\nR4's cinematic pattern (establishing shot → close-up → wide shot, mirroring learning: context → detail → synthesis) is referenced in comments but doesn't manifest as a felt experience within individual sections. The Beads section, for instance, could feel like a cinematic sequence — opening with the big-picture \"50 First Dates\" problem (wide), zooming into the architecture diagram and commands (close), then pulling back to \"Why Git as Database?\" (wide synthesis). The content structure supports it, but the visual treatment is uniform throughout, so the zoom effect is conceptual rather than felt.\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY — Component Voices**\n\nR5's framework of component voices (\"Info Callout speaks as a professional concierge,\" \"Essence Callout speaks as a wise archivist\") is honored in the *selection* of callout types but not always in the *writing within* them. The essence callouts genuinely use a different register — Instrument Serif italic, philosophical — which is excellent. But the tip callouts and info callouts sometimes sound interchangeable in their prose. The tip in the government district (\"Crew members are the cheapest way to parallelize work\") reads more like an info callout than a warm colleague sharing wisdom. The distinction exists visually but not always editorially.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Temporal and Interaction Density**\n\nR3 describes six density dimensions, but two are entirely absent from a static HTML page: temporal density (how information unfolds over scroll/time) and interaction density (clickable elements per viewport). These are legitimately absent because the artifact is a single static document with no JavaScript, no scroll-triggered behavior, no expandable sections. This is a reasonable creative choice — the KortAI world's flatness and honesty argue against scroll-triggered reveals. But R3's progressive disclosure recommendations (\"Click Depth 0: 3-5 key facts → Click Depth 1: 10-15 details → Click Depth 2: Full reference\") could have found expression in collapsible sections for the troubleshooting scenarios or the role deep-dives, maintaining flatness while honoring depth density.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS — Density Transitions (The Gradient Principle)**\n\nR3 states: \"Density should never change ABRUPTLY.

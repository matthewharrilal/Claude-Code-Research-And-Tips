The artifact's macro-density choreography is its defining achievement — the settlement metaphor governs zone-to-zone transitions so convincingly that you feel the outskirts' openness compress through the gate into the government district's bento grid, with R5's temperature management (density debt payment after six role cards, the two-callout discipline, anxiety-ending avoidance) operating as invisible structural instinct rather than applied rule, while the opposition between ambition and honesty holds throughout without either pole winning. The creative momentum is moving inward from zone-level architecture (mastered) toward component-level differentiation, as builders discover emergent structural rhymes between the page's extremes — tag cloud echoing role badges, failure scenarios creating heartbeat rhythm, subsection dividers mirroring zone boundaries at fractal scale — suggesting the metaphor wants to penetrate deeper into the rooms it has already built rather than add new rooms. The most fertile unclaimed territory is the micro-density rhythm within zones: Zone 3 stacks thirteen elements without deliberate exhalation, the Beads section flows at constant depth rather than pulsing, R4's cinematic wide-close-wide pattern exists in comments but never manifests as a felt zoom experience within any individual section, and the drop cap — defined in CSS, studied in research, positioned for the philosophical center — remains the page's most conspicuous prepared-but-undeployed editorial signal.

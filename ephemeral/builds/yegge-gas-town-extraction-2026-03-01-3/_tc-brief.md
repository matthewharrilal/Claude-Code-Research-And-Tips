## World-Description

This page lives in the industrial quarter of the KortAI world — where editorial precision meets operational scale. Every other page in the system teaches a tool or explains a pattern. This one describes a *settlement*: a place with governance, infrastructure, economy, and prerequisites for citizenship. The sharp edges here are load-bearing. The flatness is structural honesty about chaos, cost, and the irreversible transformation from programmer to factory operator.

## Opposition

The central tension is **ambition against honesty**.

This content promises factory-scale output from a solo developer — 12,000 lines of code per day, 50x productivity, the transformation from craftsperson into product manager commanding an AI workforce. It vibrates with the excitement of industrial revolution.

And then, repeatedly, deliberately, it slams the gate shut: "If you have any doubt whatsoever, you can't use it." Budget: $50-200/day. Prerequisites: 100+ hours of multi-agent experience. The warning about superintelligent chimpanzees ripping your face off is not decoration — it is a genuine selection filter.

The page must honor BOTH poles simultaneously. The thrill of what becomes possible at this scale AND the seriousness of what it demands. A builder who leans too far toward excitement produces a sales page. A builder who leans too far toward caution produces a warning label. The page must feel like standing at the entrance to something genuinely powerful — feeling the heat from the refinery, reading the sign that says you must be this tall to ride.

## Metaphor

**Arrival at a Settlement.**

The content is structured exactly like approaching and entering an unfamiliar town. The reader begins on the outskirts — the complexity ladder positions them, lets them see the settlement from a distance, establishes whether they even belong here. Then the gate: Yegge's credentials are the checkpoint. Should you trust this place? Is the person who built it credible?

Past the gate, the town square: the mental model. "Claude Code is the world's biggest fuckin' ant." This is the economic engine of the settlement, the philosophy that organizes everything else. You stand in the center and understand what this place *is*.

Then the government district: the 8 roles, hierarchically organized, each with jurisdiction and responsibilities. This is the densest zone — the reader must absorb eight specialized functions and their relationships. It should feel like seeing a city layout from elevation: complex but organized, every building with a purpose.

From there, infrastructure (Beads — the plumbing and memory), history (the 6 Waves — how this place came to exist), and the constitution (Core Principles — the laws that govern behavior). These ground the architecture in mechanism.

Then the practical zones: the housing office (Implementation — setting up your own place), the hospital (Troubleshooting — when things break), and finally the immigration office (When to Use — the honest conversation about whether you should stay or go).

The metaphor governs density: sparse at the outskirts, dense in the government district, practical and scannable in the operational zones, contemplative at the decision point.

## Arc

**Opening (You Are Here + Who is Yegge):** Vertigo and calibration. The complexity ladder tells readers they stand at the summit of a progression they've been climbing. The prerequisites are intimidating. They should feel elevated and slightly exposed — qualified but aware of what's ahead. Yegge's credentials convert that exposure into trust. The vibe-coding philosophy is both alien and intoxicating.

**Development (Mental Model + 8 Roles):** The shift hits. "You're not a programmer anymore." The ant-to-colony reframe lands with force — destabilizing in a productive way. As the 8 roles unfold, destabilization becomes architecture. The reader goes from "what IS this" to "I see how this works." The hierarchy diagram is the page's gravitational center — the moment of maximum structural density and maximum clarity simultaneously.

**Deepening (Beads + Waves + Principles):** Understanding replaces awe. The reader sees the infrastructure beneath the architecture. Beads solves the 50 First Dates problem. The 6 Waves contextualize Gas Town historically. GUPP and the other principles feel like laws of physics — not imposed rules but natural consequences of the system's design. The emotional register shifts from excitement to respect.

**Grounding (Implementation + Troubleshooting):** The reader's hands get dirty. Commands, scripts, tmux layouts, startup sequences. This should feel workmanlike — the shift from understanding to doing. Troubleshooting anchors the system in reality: things break, and here's how you fix them. Honesty creates safety.

**Resolution (When to Use + Comparisons):** The crossroads. The decision matrix and comparison tables give the reader clear sight lines. They leave either committed to building or respectfully departing with genuine understanding of why not yet. Neither outcome is a failure. The closing quote — "Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant" — resonates differently now than it would have at the top.

## Content Map

**Zone 1 — The Approach (sparse, orienting)**
- "You Are Here" + complexity ladder → opening positioning mechanism. Low density. Generous whitespace. The ladder visualization is the first structural landmark — rendered with monospace precision, breathing in space.
- Prerequisites checklist → honest gate. This filters and respects simultaneously.

**Zone 2 — Credentials (medium density, trust-building)**
- "Who is Steve Yegge?" → compact but authoritative. The career table is dense reference; the vibe-coding philosophy is the first pull-quote moment. Let Yegge's voice interrupt the editorial register.

**Zone 3 — The Core Insight (medium density, high impact)**
- "The Gas Town Mental Model" → the page's philosophical center. The ant/colony comparison needs structural weight. The "Idea Compiler" concept and the Mad Max reference both deserve editorial emphasis. Two or three pull-quote-worthy moments live here.

**Zone 4 — The Architecture (HIGH density, the gravitational center)**
- "The 8 Roles" → the densest zone. The hierarchy diagram is the page's most complex visual element. Eight role deep-dives follow, each with function, responsibilities, commands, and model recommendation. This zone should feel organized but substantial — bento-like variety within strict structure. The communication flow diagram closes this zone.

**Zone 5 — Infrastructure and Context (medium density, explanatory)**
- "Beads" + "6 Waves" + "Core Principles" → three sections that contextualize the architecture. Beads wants layered depth (the three-tier memory model). The Waves table is a clean timeline. Principles are philosophical but concrete — GUPP, Zero Framework Cognition, Cattle Not Pets. Several pull-quote moments.

**Zone 6 — Operations (practical density, scannable)**
- "Implementation Guide" + "Troubleshooting" → code-heavy, command-dense, reference-oriented. tmux layout diagrams, startup scripts, recovery commands. This zone should feel workmanlike and trustworthy. The density is high but the complexity is low — commands are atomic and self-documenting.

**Zone 7 — Decision and Archive (sparse, resolving)**
- "When to Use" + "Comparisons" → decision architecture. The flowchart and comparison tables help readers self-sort. Comparisons provide clear contrast with alternatives. Sources and metadata close the document.

## Mechanism Affinity

**Pull-quote interruption** — Yegge's voice is profane, vivid, and philosophically charged. His quotes ("the world's biggest fuckin' ant," "slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels") are natural editorial interruptions that reset the reader's emotional register.

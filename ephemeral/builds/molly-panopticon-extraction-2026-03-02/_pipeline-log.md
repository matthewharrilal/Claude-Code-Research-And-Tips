- **Artifacts produced:**
  - _screenshots/1440-full.png — 3.3MB
  - _screenshots/1440-fold.png — 108KB
  - _screenshots/1024-full.png — 3.2MB
  - _screenshots/1024-fold.png — 105KB

  - _pa/auditor-1.md — 71 lines (E-01, E-05, E-11, E-17)
  - _pa/auditor-2.md — 79 lines (E-02, E-08, E-14, E-18)
  - _pa/auditor-3.md — 65 lines (E-03, E-07, E-12, E-19)

  - _pa/synthesis.md — 258 lines (Experience Portrait + Creative Direction + Verdict + Package Compliance)
  - _comparison-report.md — extracted from synthesis Output 4
- **Quality floor check:**
  - All 6 screenshots > 10KB: PASS (all > 100KB, no blanks)
  - All 5 auditor reports exist: PASS
  - Synthesis has verdict: PASS — REFINE
  - Synthesis has package compliance: PASS — 6/9 followed, 3/9 partial, 0/9 not followed
  - Comparison report extracted: PASS
- **Verdict:** REFINE
  - TYPE A (Mechanical): 4 issues (subtitle dim, no intra-zone bg variation, metadata clinical, heading scale)
  - TYPE B (Structural): 3 issues (metronomic dark/light alternation, front-loaded energy, missing third register)
  - TYPE C (Compositional): 0 issues
- **Package compliance:** NOVEL 23/26 (88%), STANDARD 9/9 (100%)
- **Auditor convergence:** 5/5 identified dark/light alternation as monotonous by middle third. 5/5 identified opening header as strongest moment. 5/5 said REFINE.
- **Concerns:** The 3 TYPE B issues (metronomic rhythm, front-loaded energy, missing third register) are the core challenge. These are NOT compliance failures — they are limitations of the package's rhythmic vocabulary for content of this length.
- **Cumulative cost estimate:** $42-50 (Phase 4 est: $12-14)
- **Decision:** PROCEED to Phase 5 (REFINE) — verdict is REFINE, 0 TYPE C issues, all TYPE A+B addressable in 1-2 fix cycles

---

## Phase 5: REFINE — Checkpoint

- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-02 (~150 min after start)
- **Agents spawned:** 7 (1 refine builder + 5 re-eval PA auditors + 1 re-eval weaver, all Opus)
- **Fix cycles completed:** 1
- **Artifacts produced:**
  - _fixes/fix-1-page.html — 2544 lines, 104KB
  - _fixes/fix-1-feedback.md — 99 lines
  - _build-final.html — updated (copy of fix-1-page.html)
  - _screenshots/ — re-captured at all 3 viewports (1440, 1024, 768)
  - _pa/_images/ — sanitized copies updated
  - _pa/auditor-1.md — 57 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/auditor-2.md — 59 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/auditor-3.md — 79 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/auditor-4.md — 45 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/auditor-5.md — 63 lines (re-evaluation)
  - _pa/synthesis.md — 120 lines (re-evaluation weaver synthesis)
- **Fix type:** Mixed — 4 TYPE A (mechanical CSS) + 3 TYPE B (structural)
- **Fixes applied:**
  - Issue 1 (metronomic alternation): Diagnosed as cream-zone sameness, fixed via Issues 3+6
  - Issue 2 (subtitle dim): Color brightened to #AAAAAA
  - Issue 3 (no cream variation): :nth-child(even) background alternation (#FFFDF8)
  - Issue 4 (bottom third): Legend padding 80px, pre-terra transition element, terra padding 80px
  - Issue 5 (metadata clinical): Padding/color/gap softened
  - Issue 6 (third register): .philosophical-pause + enhanced .close-up treatments
  - Issue 7 (heading scale): Confirmed 24px minimum, annotations zone at 20px
- **Re-evaluation verdict:** SHIP
  - TYPE A: 0 remaining (all 4 resolved)
  - TYPE B: 0 remaining (all 3 addressed)
  - TYPE C: 1 persistent (rhythmic monotony from conservative third-register deployment — accepted as diminishing returns)
- **Re-evaluation auditor convergence:** 5/5 still note rhythmic fatigue in middle. 5/5 confirm opening header as strongest moment. 4/5 note improvement in lower third. 3/5 note philosophical-pause as right idea, sparingly deployed.
- **Package compliance (post-fix):** NOVEL 10/13, STANDARD 6/6. Proposition 5 (terra incognita) upgraded to MET.
- **Concerns:** The remaining TYPE C issue (rhythmic monotony in middle sections) is a consequence of the content's extreme length (~8000 words, 17 Parts) meeting a design vocabulary with two primary modes. A second fix cycle could add more philosophical-pause deployments but risks overcrowding. The Weaver assessed this as diminishing returns.
- **Cumulative cost estimate:** $58-68 (Phase 5 est: $16-18)
- **Decision:** SHIP — composition complete. All TYPE A and TYPE B issues resolved. Remaining TYPE C accepted as diminishing returns.

  "result": "<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: Five sections added across two stratum bands. The Surface stratum continues with Checkpoints (verification table + health check code + quality verification code) and Troubleshooting (6 failure blocks in a structured symptom→cause→recovery pattern, followed by a recovery command reference with dark header bar echoing the hierarchy diagram). A HARD CUT transition (3px red border-top) marks the domain change from \"doing\" to \"deciding\" as the Dispatch stratum opens. Dispatch contains: When to Use (green/coral use-comparison two-column grid + decision flowchart adapted from complexity ladder pattern), Quotes (7 quote groups with Instrument Serif italic in breathing-room layout), and Comparison (3 data tables with verdicts + orchestrator spectrum horizontal bar with Gas Town highlighted). New CSS: ~280 lines of component styles for failure blocks, use-comparison, decision flow, quote collections, comparison verdicts, and spectrum bar. Responsive additions for all new grid layouts.\n\nTRYING: To create a descent-then-return arc. The Surface continuation descends into diagnostic territory (when things break) with the 6 failure blocks creating a rhythm of structured anxiety followed by concrete recovery. The Dispatch stratum then rises out of the operational world entirely — the reader steps back to evaluate, listen to the collected voice, and calibrate. The quotes section is deliberately the SPARSEST moment in the Dispatch stratum, creating breathing room between the evaluative \"when to use\" and the dense comparative tables. The spectrum bar at the end is the final instrument reading — where Gas Town sits in the ecosystem, rendered as a visual object rather than a prose claim.\n\nREJECTED: (1) Considered making the 6 failure blocks a single data table (symptom | cause | recovery) — rejected because each failure needs its own code block for recovery commands, and tables can't contain code blocks cleanly. The structured card pattern preserves the symptom→cause→recovery hierarchy within each failure. (2) Considered a prose-heavy approach for the quotes section with commentary between each quote — rejected because the conviction brief says \"anthological\" and the quotes should carry their own weight. The bare Instrument Serif italic against the Dispatch stratum background does more work than any framing prose. (3) Considered rendering the decision matrix as an actual flowchart with CSS-drawn arrows and boxes — rejected because the complexity ladder pattern (vertical, left-aligned, sequential) already proved itself in the Foundation stratum, and adapting it for the decision flow maintains visual consistency while being structurally honest about the content's linear decision tree.\n\nSURPRISED: The failure blocks created an unexpected rhythm. Each block has the same 3-field structure (symptom/cause/recovery) but the recovery sections vary dramatically in density — from a single 2-line code block (Context Collapse) to prose + code (Race Conditions) to 3 separate commands (Runaway Crew). This natural density variation within a repeating structure creates the kind of \"not identical cards\" effect the verifier praised in the Operations stratum's role cards, but here it happened organically from the content rather than from deliberate layout variation. The content taught me its own rhythm.\n\nWANTED: To add visual \"wear\" to the troubleshooting section — some way to signal that this is the part of the refinery that gets used the hardest. The failure blocks should feel like battered emergency procedures cards, thumbed and coffee-stained. But the soul constraints (no gradients, no shadows, no decorative transforms) prevent surface-level distressing. The best I could do was the numbered failure headers (#01-#06 in red monospace) which evoke industrial labeling — the kind of stenciled numbers you see on factory equipment.\n\nUNRESOLVED: (1) The transition between Quotes and Comparison is a 1px section divider — the same as every other within-stratum transition. But these two sections have radically different densities (sparse quotes → dense tables). A bridge transition with explanatory prose might serve better, but the conviction brief doesn't call for it and I don't want to add words the content doesn't need. (2) The spectrum bar's 4-column grid places all orchestrators at equal visual weight, but Gas Town gets the active/highlighted treatment (warm background, red name). Whether this feels \"generous, not defensive\" or \"sneakily promotional\" depends on the reader. The content itself is honest about Gas Town being the most complex and expensive option — the visual highlight might undercut that honesty.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: The failure block pattern (numbered header + structured fields) creates a component that lives at the intersection of the role-card pattern (2-zone header/body with border-weight encoding) and the callout pattern (4px left border with semantic color). It didn't copy either — it emerged from the content's own need for structured diagnosis. The red numbering in the header (Mechanism #9: color encoding) does something neither role cards nor callouts do: it creates a SEQUENCE within a set of structurally identical components, giving the reader a sense of \"there are exactly 6 things that can go wrong, and I've seen 4 of them.\"\n- Discovery 2: The conviction brief's arc description (\"generous, not defensive\") directly shaped the use-comparison component. Originally I considered making the \"Don't Use\" column visually subordinate (lighter, smaller) to emphasize the \"Use\" column. But generosity means giving equal structural weight to the reasons NOT to use the tool. The coral accent on the \"don't\" side is actually warmer and more visually prominent than the green accent on the \"use\" side — the page argues against itself more loudly than it argues for itself. This was a creative choice that emerged from inhabiting the arc rather than decorating the content.\n- Discovery 3: The collected-quote component revealed a tension between R5's two-callout limit and the Quotes section's need for 2-3 consecutive quotes per group. The solution was NOT to use callout components — the quotes are blockquotes with the key-quote treatment (Instrument Serif italic, 4px border-left), which are editorially distinct from callouts. This means the R5 velocity/temperature rules don't apply the same way: consecutive quotes within a group read as a single \"voice collection\" rather than as multiple interruptions. The grouping label above each cluster creates the semantic container that makes the repetition feel intentional rather than fatiguing.\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

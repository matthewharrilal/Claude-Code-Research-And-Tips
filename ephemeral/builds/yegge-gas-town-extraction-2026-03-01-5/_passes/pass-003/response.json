  "result": "2601 lines — the original 1655 plus ~946 lines of new CSS and HTML content. The file is complete and well-formed.\n\n---\n\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: The Operations stratum — the factory floor, the densest layer of the entire page. Added ~300 lines of CSS (role hierarchy diagram, role cards with 3-tier grid system, model recommendation badges, communication flow diagram, role clusters with tier labels) and ~500 lines of HTML containing all 8 role deep dives, the hierarchy overview, and the communication flow. The stratum sits on `--stratum-floor: #F0E8DC` (darker than the Seismic conversion layer, signaling depth into the refinery). Three role clusters separated by section-dividers create a density wave within the section: town-level (3-column grid), rig-level (two 2-column grids with density variation between major and supporting roles), human-level (full-width inverted card).\n\nTRYING: To make the reader feel AWE AT MACHINERY — the feeling of watching a complex system unfold chamber by chamber. The hierarchy overview diagram uses a dark inverted title bar (echoing the page header shell) to feel like an engineering schematic rather than a UI card. Role cards use border-weight gradient (Mechanism #1) to encode architectural importance: Mayor and Refinery get `--color-text` dark borders (featured), Deacon/Dogs/Witness/Crew get standard `--color-border` borders. The communication flow diagram uses an F-pattern with left-aligned role names creating a vertical scanning axis, so the reader's eye can trace the feature request's path through the system. The Overseer card gets an inverted header (dark background, light text) — echoing the page's dark header shell to say \"you are the outer structure.\"\n\nREJECTED: (1) Considered making all 8 roles identical cards in a single grid — rejected because the creative direction explicitly says \"the page must not feel like 8 identical cards.\" Grouped by tier with varying grid columns instead. (2) Considered ASCII art for the hierarchy overview — rejected because HTML structural elements with real borders and backgrounds serve the refinery-schematic metaphor better than monospace character art. (3) Considered a horizontal tab system for role deep dives — rejected because it would hide content behind interaction, and this section's purpose is to REVEAL the full machine, not progressively disclose it.\n\nSURPRISED: The border-weight gradient between featured and standard role cards creates a surprisingly effective visual hierarchy at a glance. Without reading any text, you can scan the grid and immediately see which roles carry more architectural weight (Mayor, Refinery, Polecat = dark borders) versus which are supporting infrastructure (Deacon, Witness, Crew = lighter). The model recommendation badges (red for Opus, blue for Sonnet, green for Haiku) create a secondary color-coded hierarchy that reinforces the border-weight gradient through a different channel — this multi-channel reinforcement happened naturally from the content's own structure.\n\nWANTED: To add visual \"wear\" — the verifier noted the page is \"ALL precision, ZERO wear.\" I wanted to add subtle texture or roughness to the Operations stratum to feel more industrial, but the soul constraints (no gradients, no shadows, no decorative elements) make this difficult without violating physics. The tighter spacing and heavier borders in this stratum are the closest I could get to making the factory floor feel used.\n\nUNRESOLVED: The tension between the hierarchy overview diagram (a static schematic) and the communication flow (a dynamic process) needs the reader to shift cognitive modes within the same section. The section-dividers between role clusters help, but the transition from \"here are the parts\" to \"here is the machine running\" could be smoother. Future passes might address this with a bridge element between the role deep dives and the communication flow.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: Role cards with 3-zone structure (header with badge, function in Instrument Serif italic, body with responsibilities/commands) naturally create the component-level fractal rhythm the verifier was looking for — each card has sparse label → dense function → detailed body, echoing the page-level sparse → dense → detailed arc.\n- Discovery 2: The content's own structure (town-level = 3 roles, rig-level = 4 roles split into 2 major + 2 supporting, human = 1 role) naturally suggests the grid layout without forcing: 3-column, 2-column + 2-column, full-width. The content taught me its layout rather than the layout being imposed on it.\n- Discovery 3: R5-COMBINATION-THEORY's velocity model (fast/medium/slow components) directly shaped the section's rhythm: Info callout (fast) → hierarchy diagram (slow) → Essence callout (slow but contemplative) → role cards (medium, structured scan) → Tip callout (fast) → communication flow (medium) → Gotcha (fast) → Challenge (fast). The alternation between fast callouts and slow structural elements creates the density wave R3 describes, without explicitly planning a PULSE pattern — it emerged from following R5's velocity rules.\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

Vary the density between roles.\" The builder heard this and responded structurally: town-level roles live in a three-column grid of equal weight, the rig-level roles split into a two-column pair of featured cards (Refinery, Polecat — heavier borders, darker treatment) followed by a two-column pair of supporting cards (Witness, Crew — lighter borders, more compact), and the Overseer gets a full-width row with an inverted dark header. This is not cosmetic variation. Each tier *feels* different. The town-level row reads as a coordinated triad. The rig-level rows read as a hierarchy-within-hierarchy. The Overseer reads as a mirror of the page shell itself. The builder understood that \"not identical\" means structurally distinct, not color-swapped.\n\n**R3 Density Dimensions — Zone background differentiation as geological encoding.** R3's geological model (atmosphere → surface → topsoil → subsoil → bedrock) is not just referenced — it generates the page. Seven stratum backgrounds create genuine weight shifts as you scroll. The bedrock stratum (#E8E0D4) feels heavier, earthier. The seismic stratum (#FAF4EA) opens dramatically — lighter, airier, more space for the paradigm quote to breathe. The floor stratum (#F0E8DC) darkens again for operational density. You can *feel* the descent and ascent through these layers without reading a single word. The backgrounds are doing informational work — telling you whether you're in foundational territory, operational territory, or conceptual territory — through warmth alone.\n\n**DD-006 Fractal — Border-weight gradient as reusable mechanism, not as copied template.** DD-006 explicitly warns: extract the PROCESS, not the ANSWER. The builder extracted the border-weight gradient mechanism (thick borders = high priority) and applied it to completely different content: 4px red on the active complexity ladder level, 4px/3px/1px on hot/warm/cold memory layers, heavier borders on town-level role boxes vs lighter on rig-level. None of this copies DD-006's fractal scales. The mechanism serves *this* content's hierarchy — retrieval urgency in the memory model, architectural authority in the role diagram. This is genuine mechanism extraction, not pattern-matching.\n\n**R5 Combination Theory — The two-callout limit and temperature buffering.** At the end of the Operations stratum, the builder places a gotcha callout (cold: \"the merge queue is sequential, not parallel\") immediately followed by a challenge callout (warm: \"trace a real feature you've built recently\"). This is exactly two callouts — the limit R5 imposes before sidebar fatigue. And the temperature arc is deliberate: cold warning → warm invitation. In the Principles stratum, after the critical warning box (the coldest moment on the page), a section divider provides the buffer R5 demands between cold and the next principle block. The builder is counting callouts and managing temperature transitions consciously.\n\n**R5 — Setup-Payoff Arc (S1) in the Infrastructure section.** The Beads section follows S1 almost exactly: Context (the \"50 First Dates\" quote — emotionally grounding), Map (the failure table — what's broken), Principle (Beads features — what solves it), Demonstration (architecture diagram + code commands), Principle reprise (essence callout on \"git as database\"), Action/Resolution (tip callout on hash-based IDs preventing collision). The section has a narrative arc, not just a list of facts. It moves from problem through solution to understanding.\n\n**The refinery cross-section metaphor as HTML structure, not CSS decoration.** The creative direction's metaphor — a vertical slice through an industrial facility — dictated the page's DOM architecture. The TOC groups items by stratum name. Section-meta labels announce the current stratum (\"Foundation Stratum · Orientation,\" \"Conversion Stratum · Paradigm Shift\"). Hard cuts between strata use the red alarm color. The metaphor is load-bearing: remove it and you'd have to restructure the HTML, not just restyle the CSS. This is the deepest kind of integration — the metaphor shaped the builder's organizational decisions, not their decorative ones.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**R4 Axis Innovations — Z-pattern attribution on two-column layouts.** The CSS comments claim \"Z-pattern → eye sweeps across both columns\" for the paradigm comparison and state comparison grids. But Z-pattern requires a specific diagonal sweep from top-left through center to bottom-right, with a CTA at the terminal position. These are simple side-by-side comparison grids. They work beautifully *as comparison grids* — the traditional/Gas Town paradigm columns are one of the page's strongest moments — but the Z-pattern label is a citation of vocabulary, not a structural implementation. The builder knows the term but hasn't shaped the content flow to exploit the diagonal.\n\n**R3 — Named density rhythm patterns (PULSE, CRESCENDO, BOOKENDS, WAVE).** The CSS comments reference \"density wave sequencing\" and the overall page does have density variation (medium foundation → sparse conversion → dense operations → medium-high infrastructure → medium principles → medium surface). But this feels like the natural shape of the *content*, not a deliberately chosen rhythm pattern from R3's catalog. The content itself is sparse in the paradigm section and dense in the roles section. The builder followed the content's inherent density rather than imposing a rhythm. This isn't wrong — but R3 offers tools for *shaping* density independently of content, and those tools remain unused.\n\n**R4 — Bento grid claims on the hierarchy diagram.** The comments say \"bento grid\" and \"bento-like spatial organization,\" but the actual hierarchy overview uses uniform three-column grids within each tier. Bento's signature is varied cell sizes signaling importance — a large feature cell next to two small cells. The role cards in their tier groupings (3 + 2 + 2 + 1) come closer to bento variation through column count changes, but the hierarchy overview diagram at the top of the operations section is a standard uniform grid, not a bento.\n\n**DD-006 — Mechanism citations in comments.** The CSS comments reference \"Mechanism #1,\" \"Mechanism #2,\" \"Mechanism #7,\" \"Mechanism #10,\" etc. These references are accurate — the builder is applying the right mechanisms in the right places. But the citation style feels performative, like footnotes in a term paper. The mechanisms themselves are well-applied; the comments don't add integration depth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**R3 — Interaction density (progressive disclosure).** The page has zero interactive elements. No expandable role details, no collapsible code blocks, no click-to-expand deep dives. R3 devotes an entire section to interaction density zones and says progressive disclosure is \"essential for complex documentation.\" For a page about an 8-role system with extensive CLI commands, the absence of any progressive disclosure is felt. The operations stratum presents all 8 role cards at full density — there's no way for a reader who just wants the overview to skip the deep dives, or for a reader who wants details on the Mayor to expand just that card. The page is 100% reading zone. R3's insight about \"three interaction zones: exploration, action, reading\" goes entirely unexplored. (Relevant because the creative direction says \"the reader's hands meet the machine\" in the Surface stratum — but the reader's hands never actually touch anything.)\n\n**R3 — Density debt after the operations peak.** R3 says \"every dense element creates 'density debt' — the user needs recovery space.\" The operations stratum is the page's density peak — hierarchy diagram, 8 role cards in clusters, communication flow diagram, t",

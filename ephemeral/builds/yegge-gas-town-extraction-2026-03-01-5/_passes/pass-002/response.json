DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**The refinery cross-section is structural, not decorative.** The creative direction describes a \"vertical slice through an industrial facility, viewed from the side, showing stacked operational levels from foundation to output.\" The builder internalized this. The full-width `.stratum` bands with their distinct warm backgrounds (`--stratum-bedrock: #E8E0D4` through `--stratum-dispatch: #EDE5D9`) constrained to a 960px `.page-spine` ARE the cross-section. This isn't a metaphor applied to a layout — the layout IS the metaphor. Every section lives inside a named geological band. The TOC groups its items by stratum label (Foundation, Conversion, Operations, Infrastructure, Principles, Surface, Dispatch). A builder who hadn't read the creative direction deeply would have made a flat page with colored section headers. This builder made the earth itself change color as you descend.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md's zone background differentiation (Insight 24, the Geological Framework) genuinely governs the page architecture.** The research describes \"density strata\" — atmosphere, surface, topsoil, subsoil, bedrock — where users drill DOWN into density by choice. The builder mapped this directly: the bedrock stratum (`#E8E0D4`, the darkest warm tone) contains the qualifying, load-bearing foundation content. The seismic stratum (`#FAF4EA`, dramatically lighter) opens up for the paradigm shift. The background progression encodes meaning — darker = foundational, lighter = revelatory. This is R3's geological model made real.\n\n**The creative direction's arc from LOCATED to DESTABILIZED is felt.** The Foundation stratum places you with military precision: a vertical complexity ladder with your position marked in red, a before/after state comparison that reads like a briefing, a prerequisites checklist with empty square markers that feel like a form you haven't earned the right to complete. Nothing here welcomes you. The section-meta labels (\"Foundation Stratum · Orientation\") read like coordinates on an industrial schematic. Then the 3px red hard-cut boundary hits, the background shifts lighter by twenty RGB points, and the paradigm quote lands in Instrument Serif italic at 1.75rem with a red left border and generous whitespace on all sides. The isolation of that quote — the breathing room the builder gave it — makes it hit like a door opening into a larger room. This follows the creative direction's instruction: \"The 'biggest fuckin' ant' quote is the hinge moment. It must land with typographic weight.\"\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY's first-component-sets-tone principle (S3) shapes the opening.** The first structural element after the section heading is the complexity ladder — not a welcome message, not an overview paragraph, but a vertical truth that says \"here is where you stand, and here is high.\" This sets the tone of the entire Foundation stratum as qualifying, not inviting. The creative direction asked for \"a firm hand on the shoulder pointing at a map\" and that is exactly what the ladder delivers.\n\n**R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS' F-pattern governs the complexity ladder.** The ladder is left-aligned with level numbers creating a strong vertical scanning axis. The active level breaks the pattern with a 4px red left border and warm background — exactly how the research describes breaking established rhythm for emphasis. The eye scans down the left edge, hits the red interruption, registers the active level, and continues. This is F-pattern applied to a specific content structure, not F-pattern as a label.\n\n**The dark header/footer bookend (Mechanism #13 and #14) creates the refinery's exterior shell.** The `#1A1A1A` background with 3px red bottom border reads as the industrial casing of the facility. The footer mirrors it with a 3px red top border. Everything between these two dark shells is the interior cross-section. This framing device makes the stratum colors feel like they're INSIDE something — you're looking at the interior of a machine, not at a decorated webpage.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**R3's density rhythm patterns are named in comments but not enacted between components.** The CSS comments reference \"density rhythm,\" \"PULSE pattern,\" and \"CRESCENDO,\" but within each stratum, the components march at a uniform pace. The spacing between the complexity ladder, the state comparison, the prerequisites, and the Yegge biography is consistent — roughly `var(--space-8)` throughout. The research describes PULSE as \"High-Low-High-Low cycles, like a heartbeat\" and WAVE as \"irregular but rhythmic.\" Neither pattern is visible in the actual vertical rhythm of the Foundation stratum. The components are evenly spaced, like fence posts, rather than breathing in and out.\n\n**R5's velocity/temperature model exists in the CSS infrastructure but doesn't create felt variation.** The callout system is fully built — info (blue), tip (green), gotcha (coral), essence (purple), challenge (amber) — with distinct backgrounds and border colors. But in the visible content, no callouts appear. The Foundation and Conversion strata use only tables, lists, quotes, and custom structural elements. The callout infrastructure is ready but silent. When it activates in later strata, the question will be whether the builder sequences callouts with velocity awareness (fast components between slow ones, per R5 Principle T2) or simply places them where the content mentions something callout-worthy.\n\n**The stratum boundary transition grammar is declared but only one type appears.** The CSS defines two transition types: hard cut (3px red, domain change) and spacing shift (1px separator, same domain). The Bedrock-to-Seismic boundary uses the hard cut correctly — it's a genuine domain change from qualification to revelation. But the 1px separator between \"You Are Here\" and \"Who Is Steve Yegge?\" within the Bedrock stratum doesn't create a felt transition. It's a line. The research on density transitions (R3, Section 7.1 — \"The Gradient Principle\") describes how \"density should never change ABRUPTLY\" and recommends whitespace buffers and summary bridges. The within-stratum transition is technically present but perceptually flat.\n\n**Mechanism numbers in comments serve as inventory, not as creative reasoning.** Comments like \"Mechanism #1: Border-weight gradient\" and \"Mechanism #18: Data Table\" appear throughout. These correctly identify which catalog entry is being applied, but the comments read more like a checklist (\"I used this mechanism\") than like creative reasoning (\"this mechanism serves this tension because...\"). The builder knows the vocabulary. The question is whether the mechanisms are being orchestrated or merely deployed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**The creative direction's central tension — \"chaos against architecture\" — has no visible expression.** The direction states: \"A page that looks too clean betrays the content. A page that looks too wild betrays the engineering. The builder must construct something that feels like a precisely engineered control room inside a post-apocalyptic refinery — every instrument exact, every surface showing wear.\" The current artifact is ALL precision, ZERO wear. Every border is clean. Every background is smooth. Every table is perfectly aligned. The content itself carries the chaos — \"some bugs fixed 2-3 times,\" \"100% vibe-coded,\" \"smuggled 400 miles upriver in my ass\" — but the visual treatment contains that chaos inside pristine containers. The refinery has been renovated. The instruments are new. There is no evidence that anything in this facility has ever been used hard. This is the single largest gap between direction and artifact.\n\n**DD-006's fractal self-similarity has no expression at any scale.** The case study demonstrates how the SAME rhythm (dense/sparse alternation) should appear at page level, section level, component level, and character level.

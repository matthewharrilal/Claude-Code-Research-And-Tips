You are a reader. You are about to read several documents that represent the creative philosophy and research of a design system. Then you will read an HTML page built to embody that philosophy.

Your job is not to audit. Your job is not to check compliance. Your job is to FEEL whether the page was built by someone who deeply understood the material, or by someone who read a different document entirely.

## THE WORLD THIS PAGE LIVES IN

You are building inside a world with its own physics.

This world belongs to KortAI — a design system born from editorial confidence and geometric precision. Every surface is flat. Every edge is sharp. Every color is warm. The atmosphere is earth-toned cream and near-black, punctuated by a single red (#E83025) that appears only when something demands attention.

The geometry refuses roundness. Not as a rule imposed from outside, but as a property of reality — the way gravity is a property of reality. Borders are sharp because the world is decisive. Surfaces are flat because the world is honest. Shadows do not exist because nothing here pretends to float above the page.

Three typefaces speak: Instrument Serif for display headings (editorial authority), Inter for body text (readable precision), JetBrains Mono for code (literal truth). No other voices.

Spacing follows a 4px heartbeat. Colors stay warm: every background hex satisfies R >= G >= B. The container spine holds at 940-960px — wide enough for authority, narrow enough for intimacy.

This is not a style guide you are applying. This is the world you are building in. Its constraints are not limitations — they are the physics that make your creative decisions meaningful. A sharp edge in a world of sharp edges is invisible. A moment of generous whitespace in a world of precision is a statement.

Build as if this world has always existed, and you are adding a room to it.

## THE CREATIVE DIRECTION THE BUILDER RECEIVED

## World-Description

This page lives in the part of the KortAI world where the geometry gets industrial. Where the sharp edges stop being aesthetic and start being structural — load-bearing walls in a factory that builds other factories. The earth tones here are closer to rust and engine grease than cream and paper. The single red appears not as accent but as alarm: the content itself warns you away unless you belong here.

## Opposition

The central tension is **chaos against architecture**. Every sentence in this document serves two masters simultaneously.

On one side: a system so precisely hierarchical it has 8 named roles, explicit communication flows, model-tier recommendations per role, and startup sequences that read like launch checklists. GUPP is a protocol. The merge queue is sequential. Quality gates exist. The architecture diagram has clean boxes and clean arrows.

On the other side: "some bugs fixed 2-3 times." "Some fixes get lost." "Code is 3 weeks old — smuggled 400 miles upriver in my ass." "100% vibe-coded — I have never looked at the code myself." Nondeterministic idempotence. Comfort with chaos as a literal prerequisite.

The page must hold both truths without resolving them. The architecture IS the chaos management. The chaos IS the productive engine. A page that looks too clean betrays the content. A page that looks too wild betrays the engineering. The builder must construct something that feels like a precisely engineered control room inside a post-apocalyptic refinery — every instrument exact, every surface showing wear.

## Metaphor

The structural metaphor is the **refinery cross-section** — a vertical slice through an industrial facility, viewed from the side, showing stacked operational levels from foundation to output.

This is not decorative. It emerges from the content's own architecture: the document literally moves from bedrock (prerequisites, "you are here" on the complexity ladder) up through the paradigm shift (the mental model), through the factory floor (8 roles), through the infrastructure systems (Beads memory), through the operating principles (GUPP, zero framework cognition), to the surface level (daily workflow, troubleshooting), and finally the dispatch office (when to use, comparisons with alternatives).

The cross-section organizes the page into visible strata:

- **Foundation stratum**: Who this is for, where they stand, what they need. Dense with qualification. The bedrock that everything rests on.
- **Conversion stratum**: The paradigm shift. Ant → colony. Programmer → PM. This is where the ground transforms — the narrowest layer but the most seismically important.
- **Operations stratum**: The 8 roles. The widest, densest layer. The factory floor itself. This is where the page earns its authority — showing the full machine.
- **Infrastructure stratum**: Beads, the memory system. Runs beneath the operations floor like plumbing and wiring. Essential but subordinate.
- **Principles stratum**: The operating rules. GUPP, cattle-not-pets, nondeterministic idempotence. The physics of this particular factory.
- **Surface stratum**: Installation, daily workflow, troubleshooting. Where the reader's hands meet the machine.
- **Dispatch stratum**: Decision guidance, comparisons. The loading dock — should this cargo even be here?

## Arc

**Opening (Foundation):** The reader should feel *located*. Not welcomed — placed. A firm hand on the shoulder pointing at a map that says "you are here, and here is high." The complexity ladder is a vertical truth: you earned your way to this altitude. The prerequisites feel like a bouncer's checklist — not hostile, but serious. The emotion is **respect earned, not given**.

**First turn (Conversion):** A door opens. The core insight — "nature prefers colonies" — should land like a paradigm crack. The reader's mental model of what they've been doing (making the ant run longer) should suddenly feel small. Not wrong — small. The emotion shifts from located to **destabilized**. The comparison diagrams (traditional vs. Gas Town) should feel like seeing a new dimension.

**Ascent (Operations):** The 8 roles unfold and the reader should feel **awe at machinery**. Not intimidation — the awe of watching a complex system that makes sense. Each role is a new chamber in the factory revealed. The hierarchy diagram is the peak density moment — the most information per viewport in the entire page. The deep dives are pressure-relief valves between peaks.

**Deepening (Infrastructure + Principles):** After the operational peak, the reader descends into systems. Beads should feel like **discovering the hidden plumbing** — "oh, THAT's how they share memory." The principles (GUPP, cattle-not-pets) should feel like **laws of physics being named** — not invented, recognized. The 6 waves table provides temporal context: you're not just learning a tool, you're standing at a point in evolution.

**Surface (Implementation):** Relief. **Grounding**. After the conceptual density, the reader's hands find concrete surfaces: `go install`, `gt init`, tmux layouts, startup scripts. The emotion is "I could actually do this." The daily workflow section should feel like watching someone's morning routine — intimate, practical, demystifying.

**Closure (Decision):** Honest self-assessment. The "when NOT to use" section should feel **generous, not defensive** — like a master craftsman saying "this tool isn't for every job." The comparison matrices provide the final calibration: where Gas Town sits in the ecosystem. The reader leaves feeling oriented, not sold.

## Content Map

**Foundation stratum** maps to: "You Are Here" + "Who is Steve Yegge?"
- The complexity ladder diagram is the page's first structural landmark — vertical, sharp, immediately orienting.
- Yegge's bio establishes credibility through career facts, not rhetoric. The table format serves this: compact authority.
- Density: MEDIUM. Enough to establish stakes, not so much it delays the core insight.

**Conversion stratum** maps to: "The Gas Town Mental Model"
- The "biggest fuckin' ant" quote is the hinge moment. It must land with typographic weight — Instrument Serif, generous whitespace.
- The Traditional vs. Gas Town comparison is the content's most important diagram. Two columns, stark contrast.
- The "Idea Compiler" concept deserves its own breathing moment.
- Density: LOW spatially, HIGH semantically. Few elements, each carrying maximum meaning.

**Operations stratum** maps to: "The 8 Roles Architecture"
- The hierarchy overview diagram is the page's density peak. The full system visible at once.
- The 8 role deep-dives need rhythm: each role gets consistent structure (function, responsibilities, commands, model recommendation) but the page must not feel like 8 identical cards. Vary the density between roles.
- The communication flow diagram resolves the roles into action — it shows the machine running, not just sitting.
- Density: HIGH, with deliberate breathing moments between role clusters (town-level roles, rig-level roles, human level).

**Infrastructure stratum** maps to: "Beads: The Memory System"
- Opens with the "50 First Dates" problem — immediately relatable, emotionally grounding after the architectural density.
- The memory model layers (hot/warm/cold) are a natural teaching progression.
- "Why Git as Database?" is a principle worth isolating.
- Density: MEDIUM-HIGH, but more narrative than the roles section.

**Principles stratum** maps to: "The 6 Waves of AI" + "Core Principles"
- The 6 waves table provides historical sweep — the reader sees where they sit in time.
- GUPP, zero framework cognition, cattle-not-pets, nondeterministic idempotence: each deserves distinct treatment. These are laws, not tips.
- Density: MEDIUM. Conceptual weight is high but spatial density should be moderate.

**Surface stratum** maps to: "Implem

# DD-006-fractal — Fractal Density Case Study

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Exploration:** DD-006-fractal.html (36/40, highest-scored DD exploration)
**Pattern:** FRACTAL (Meta-Pattern)
**Status:** Crown jewel — 20+ inbound references, mandatory for all OD/AD/CD work

---

## 1. NOT A TEMPLATE Warning

**⚠️ THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE — IT IS A CASE STUDY**

This document shows what ONE metaphor produced for ONE specific content tension. Pattern-matching to this output defeats the purpose of tension-derived composition.

**Why this warning exists:**

When you see fractal self-similarity with 4 discrete scales (page/section/component/character) and specific CSS values (80px sparse padding, 24px dense padding, specific border weights), your working memory treats it as a TEMPLATE to adapt, not a PROOF to study.

This is pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.

**Your assignment:** Extract the PROCESS (how tension → metaphor → 4-scale rhythm), not the ANSWER (fractal → page/section/component/character → these specific CSS values).

**The trap:** "My content has alternating complexity too, so I'll use fractal with 4 scales at 80px/32px/16px/4px."

**The correct path:** "My content has rhythmic variation. Phase 1-2 tension derivation will reveal MY metaphor. It might converge to fractal (genuine independent discovery) or diverge completely. The scales might be 3, 5, or continuous. The spacing values will be derived from MY content's perceptual needs, not copied from this artifact. I won't know until after Phase 3."

---

## 2. Purpose of This Case Study

**What this case study proves:** Self-similar rhythm across ALL structural scales (page → section → component → character) CAN be compositionally resolved and produces recognizable, coherent structure.

**What tension type it addresses:** Content with alternating density needs at EVERY level simultaneously — not just page sections alternating dense/sparse, but ALSO paragraphs alternating, AND component zones alternating, AND code lines alternating. Opposition exists at all scales, not just one.

**What mechanism it demonstrates:**
- Dense/sparse alternation (Mechanism #5)
- Spacing compression gradient (Mechanism #4)
- Border-weight gradient encoding (Mechanism #1)
- Zone background differentiation (Mechanism #7)
- Typographic scale jumping (Mechanism #11)
- 2-zone component DNA at multiple scales (Mechanism #2)

---

## 3. Tension That Produced This

**Content Analyzed:**

**Content:** Documentation explaining self-similarity concept — 1,060 lines
**Subject:** Teaching fractal density pattern through demonstration at 4 scales
**Challenge:** Content ABOUT self-similarity must DEMONSTRATE self-similarity

### Phase 1 — Multi-Axis Questioning (Actual Questions)

**Meta-Content Axis (Content About Content):**
- Q: Does content describe a pattern that should be VISIBLE in the content itself?
- A: YES — Content teaches "same rhythm at every scale" so the page must SHOW this

**Complexity Spectrum Axis:**
- Q: Does content serve audiences with different depth needs (novice vs expert)?
- A: YES — Some readers need concept overview, others need implementation details
- Q: Can the SAME content support both simultaneously?
- A: YES — If rhythm is self-similar, shallow readers stop early, deep readers continue

**Structural Harmony Axis:**
- Q: Does content structure mirror the concept being taught?
- A: MUST — Teaching fractal patterns with non-fractal structure creates cognitive dissonance

### Phase 2 — Tension Derivation (Actual Table)

| Side A | Opposition | Side B | Overlap | Width Score |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Conceptual explanation (abstract) | ←→ | Concrete demonstration (visible) | Both needed for comprehension | 9/10 |
| Shallow reading (overview only) | ←→ | Deep reading (full implementation) | Both serve valid learning paths | 8/10 |
| Page-level structure | ←→ | Character-level structure | Fractal requires ALL scales | 10/10 |
| Teaching the pattern | ←→ | BEING the pattern | Meta-content demands alignment | 10/10 |

**Richness Score:** 37/40 → 92.5% → Track 2 warranted (high tension, creative metaphor needed)

### What Axes Were Explored

**Explored:**
1. **Meta-Content Harmony** (PRODUCTIVE — led to "content must demonstrate what it teaches")
2. **Depth Spectrum** (PRODUCTIVE — led to fractal rhythm supporting multiple reading depths)
3. **Scale Self-Similarity** (PRODUCTIVE — led to 4-level fractal structure)
4. **Simple vs Complex** (REJECTED — content is uniformly medium complexity)
5. **Linear vs Networked** (REJECTED — content follows linear progression)

### What Candidates Were Considered and Rejected

**Metaphor Candidates Considered:**

1. **Nested Boxes** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Visual representation of containment at multiple scales
   - Why rejected: Static nesting doesn't convey RHYTHM (dense/sparse alternation)

2. **Musical Rhythm** (rejected)
   - Why tried: Rhythm is inherently temporal, could map to spatial content flow
   - Why rejected: Music metaphor doesn't encode visual DENSITY (spacing, borders, typography)

3. **Fractal Self-Similarity** (SELECTED)
   - Why tried: Natural world fractals (fern leaves, coastlines, snowflakes) show same pattern at all scales
   - Why it worked: Fractal metaphor NATURALLY demands rhythm repetition at page/section/component/character levels simultaneously
   - **The collapse moment:** Realizing fractal doesn't just mean "nested" — it means THE SAME RHYTHM VISIBLE AT EVERY ZOOM LEVEL

---

## 4. The Search in Action

### The Metaphor Discovery Moment

**The insight:** Content had a self-referential requirement — teaching fractal density means the page ITSELF must be fractal. The metaphor emerged from content identity, not from content structure analysis.

**Why this metaphor resonated:** Fractals in nature (fern leaves 🌿) aren't just "small copies of big things" — they're the SAME BRANCHING RHYTHM repeated at every zoom level. A fern frond has dense leaflets (inhale) alternating with sparse gaps (exhale). Zoom into one leaflet: same dense/sparse rhythm. Zoom into one sub-leaflet: SAME RHYTHM. This is fractal.

Mapping to documentation: Page sections alternate dense/sparse. Zoom into one section: paragraphs alternate dense/sparse. Zoom into one component: zones alternate dense/sparse. Zoom into code: lines alternate dense/sparse.

### What Made This Metaphor Resonate with the Tensions

**Tension 1 (Conceptual vs Concrete):**
- Metaphor resolution: The page IS a fractal (concrete) while TEACHING fractals (conceptual)
- Why it works: No dissonance — the visual structure matches the verbal explanation

**Tension 2 (Shallow vs Deep Reading):**
- Metaphor resolution: Readers stop at ANY scale (page overview, section detail, component implementation, code reference)
- Why it works: Fractal rhythm at all scales means stopping at ANY level yields coherent understanding

**Tension 3 (Page-Level vs Character-Level):**
- Metaphor resolution: The SAME alternation pattern (dense/sparse) must exist at ALL 4 scales simultaneously
- Why it works: Fractal demands cross-scale self-similarity, not isolated patterns

**Tension 4 (Teaching vs Being):**
- Metaphor resolution: The artifact doesn't just DESCRIBE fractal density — it IS fractal density
- Why it works: Meta-content alignment — students experience what they're learning

### The Moment of Collapse

**The collapse moment:** Realizing that if the page demonstrates fractal at page level (sections alternate dense/sparse) but NOT at component level (all callouts have uniform density), it's NOT fractal — it's just sectioned.

**Before collapse:** Four separate design decisions:
1. How to structure page sections (dense reference, sparse context)
2. How to structure section paragraphs (detailed steps, reflective pauses)
3. How to structure component zones (labels, content)
4. How to structure code (logic, comments)

**After collapse:** ONE fractal constraint resolves all four:
- Page level: Dense/Sparse/Dense sections
- Section level: Dense paragraphs/Whitespace/Dense paragraphs
- Component level: Dense label/Sparse body
- Character level: Dense code/Sparse comments

The metaphor doesn't generate four answers — it generates ONE RHYTHM that applies at four scales.

### How the Metaphor Dictated Structure

**The metaphor DICTATED:**

1. **4-level structure** (page/section/component/character)
   - Metaphor demanded: Fractal requires demonstration at MULTIPLE scales (not 2, not 1)
   - Not negotiable: Showing rhythm at only page+section levels fails fractal definition
   - Why 4 specifically: HTML has natural structural hierarchy (document, section, component, line)

2. **Same pattern at every scale** (dense/sparse alternation)
   - Metaphor demanded: SELF-SIMILAR means THE SAME pattern, not SIMILAR patterns
   - Not negotiable: Different rhythms at different scales = not fractal (just hierarchical)
   - Visual encoding: Background shading, spacing compression, border weights all alternate

3. **Scale visualization at top** (4-column comparison showing █░░█░░█░░ at each level)
   - Metaphor demanded: Make the fractal pattern VISIBLE immediately
   - Not negotiable: Teaching fractal without showing the pattern creates pedagogical gap
   - Implementation: Nested boxes showing dense/sparse/dense/sparse structure

### Where Mechanisms Were Applied

**Mechanisms applied from catalog:**

1. **Dense/Sparse Alternation** (Mechanism #5)
   - Applied: Page sections (80px sparse padding → 32px dense), paragraphs (1.8 sparse line-height → 1.5 dense)
   - Why here: Fractal demanded alternation rhythm at page and section scales

2. **Spacing Compression** (Mechanism #4)
   - Applied: 80px padding (sparse sections) → 32px (moderate) → 16px (dense zones) → 4px (code gutters)
   - Why here: Density gradient encodes scale depth (page → section → component → character)

3. **Border-Weight Gradient** (Mechanism #1)
   - Applied: 4px borders (high-priority callouts), 3px (section dividers), 2px (para backgrounds), 1px (separators)
   - Why here: Weight encodes importance AND scale level

4. **Zone Background Differentiation** (Mechanism #7)
   - Applied: #FEF9F5 (page sparse), #FFFFFF (section sparse), #F0EBE3 (component dense), #1A1A1A (code bedrock)
   - Why here: Background progression encodes density at each fractal level

5. **Typographic Scale Jumping** (Mechanism #11)
   - Applied: 32px (page titles) → 28px (section headings) → 20px (component headers) → 14px (code comments)
   - Why here: ~1.4x ratio between levels mirrors fractal scale reduction

6. **2-Zone Component DNA** (Mechanism #2)
   - Applied: Callouts have dense label (10px uppercase mono) + sparse body (14-17px body text)
   - Why here: Component-level fractal requires internal dense/sparse rhythm within each component

---

## 5. What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)

### ☑ REUSABLE MECHANISMS (Apply to YOUR metaphor)

☑ **Dense/Sparse Alternation** — Works for ANY rhythmic content flow
   - What it is: Alternate between visually dense zones (compact spacing, rich content) and sparse zones (generous whitespace, breathing room)
   - Why reusable: Rhythm is universal; what creates "dense" vs "sparse" adapts to your content
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR content rhythm (not dense/sparse specifically) to spacing/background alternation

☑ **Spacing Compression Gradient** — Works for ANY depth/hierarchy/importance encoding
   - What it is: Decrease padding/margin as you move deeper into structure or increase importance
   - Why reusable: Compression signals "more packed" universally (works for depth, priority, density)
   - How to adapt: Define YOUR compression axis (depth, confidence, complexity) and map to spacing scale

☑ **Border-Weight Gradient** — Works for ANY hierarchy/priority encoding
   - What it is: Use border thickness (4px/3px/2px/1px) to encode semantic levels
   - Why reusable: Visual weight = importance/emphasis is cross-cultural perceptual primitive
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR priority hierarchy to border-weight scale (not necessarily 4px/3px/2px/1px)

☑ **Zone Background Differentiation** — Works for ANY zone/category/state encoding
   - What it is: Use background color progression to distinguish zones or states
   - Why reusable: Color differentiation aids scanability regardless of semantic meaning
   - How to adapt: Map YOUR zones (not sparse/dense specifically) to background palette

☑ **Typographic Scale Jumping** — Works for ANY content hierarchy
   - What it is: ~1.4-1.5x ratio between heading levels creates clear hierarchy
   - Why reusable: Scale jumps signal importance universally
   - How to adapt: Use YOUR content heading structure, maintain ratio principle

☑ **2-Zone Component DNA** — Works for ANY component needing label+content split
   - What it is: Sparse meta-level label (uppercase, mono, small) + dense content zone
   - Why reusable: Label/content split is universal component pattern
   - How to adapt: Apply to YOUR components (callouts, cards, sections) regardless of metaphor

### ✗ NOT REUSABLE (Metaphor-Specific)

✗ **4-level structure** (page/section/component/character)
   - Why not reusable: YOUR content may have 3 levels, 5 levels, or continuous depth
   - The decision: 4 scales matched HTML's natural structural hierarchy (contingent on HTML semantics)
   - YOUR metaphor: Might use 3 scales (page/section/element) or 5 (page/chapter/section/component/character)

✗ **Fractal vocabulary** ("self-similar", "zoom level", "scale", "rhythm")
   - Why not reusable: Only makes sense within fractal metaphor
   - The decision: Labels reinforce fractal metaphor coherence (metaphor-dependent)
   - YOUR metaphor: Will have different vocabulary (geological layers, musical movements, spatial zones)

✗ **Specific spacing values** (80px/32px/16px/4px)
   - Why not reusable: Derived from THIS content's viewport constraints + perceptual testing
   - The decision: 80px sparse padding felt spacious at 1440px viewport without wasting vertical space
   - YOUR metaphor: Will derive spacing from YOUR content density needs + viewport + perceptual floor

✗ **Dense/sparse as THE dichotomy**
   - Why not reusable: YOUR content tension might be warm/austere, simple/complex, fast/slow
   - The decision: "Dense vs sparse" maps to information packing (contingent on documentation content type)
   - YOUR metaphor: Might encode confidence (high/low), certainty (established/exploratory), speed (quick/deep)

✗ **Same pattern at ALL scales**
   - Why not reusable: Fractal metaphor demands self-similarity; YOUR metaphor might demand VARIATION
   - The decision: Fractal = repetition; other metaphors might use progression, transformation, divergence
   - YOUR metaphor: Geological layers CHANGE as you go deeper (topsoil → bedrock), not repeat

✗ **Background progression from light to dark**
   - Why not reusable: Light-to-dark encodes "increasing density" in fractal; YOUR metaphor might reverse this
   - The decision: Darker backgrounds feel heavier/denser (perceptual bias)
   - YOUR metaphor: Might use color HUE shift (blue → red), saturation (muted → vibrant), or temperature (cool → warm)

## 6. Your Divergence Assignment

### Divergence Verification Table

| Comparison Dimension | DD-006 Fractal | Your Metaphor | Convergence? | Justification Required |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Core Metaphor** | Fractal self-similarity (natural world patterns) | [Your metaphor] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Spatial Encoding** | SAME rhythm at ALL scales (page/section/component/character) | [Your encoding] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Primary Tension** | Meta-content alignment (teaching fractal BY BEING fractal) | [Your tensions] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Structural Pattern** | 4 discrete scales with identical dense/sparse alternation | [Your structure] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |
| **Visual Treatment** | Spacing compression (80px → 4px) + background shading + border weights | [Your treatment] | ☐ Similar ☐ Different | If similar, justify below |

### If Convergence Detected (Any "Similar" boxes checked)

**You MUST provide STRONG evidence of independent derivation:**

#### Evidence of Independent Convergence

**Requirement:** Show your Phase 1-2 work proving you derived this metaphor independently.

1. **Phase 1 Multi-Axis Questions:**
   [Paste your actual questions — must be content-specific, not copied from this case study]
   - Did you independently discover meta-content tension (content teaching what it demonstrates)?
   - Did you independently identify the need for ALL scales (not just page or section)?

2. **Phase 2 Tension Table:**
   [Paste your actual tension derivation — must show genuine opposition + overlap analysis]
   - Does your tension table show independent discovery of cross-scale harmony requirement?
   - Does your richness score independently justify creative metaphor search?

3. **Phase 3 Search Query:**
   [Paste your query — must be constructed from YOUR tensions, not adapted from this case study]
   - Did "fractal" emerge from YOUR query, or did you pattern-match from this case study?

4. **Convergence Explanation:**
   [Explain WHY your independent process led to same metaphor]

   **Example valid convergence:**
   > "My content ALSO teaches a self-similar pattern (recursive data structures in code). The meta-content tension is identical: teaching recursion with recursive documentation structure. Fractal metaphor emerged independently because recursion = self-similarity at all depths. Convergence is genuine — two different contents with identical meta-structural requirements led to same metaphor."

   **Example INVALID convergence (pattern-matching):**
   > "My content has sections and paragraphs, so I'll use fractal with 4 scales like DD-006."
   > ← This is pattern-matching. Sections+paragraphs exist in ALL documentation. That's not sufficient tension for fractal.

#### If You Cannot Provide Strong Evidence

**STOP. You pattern-matched.**

Re-run Phase 3 with explicit constraint: **"Fractal is taken. What ELSE resolves this tension?"**

**Alternative metaphors to explore:**
- **Nested Russian Dolls** (containment at scales, but WITHOUT rhythm alternation)
- **Zoom Lens Photography** (same scene at different zoom levels, emphasizing detail revelation)
- **Microscope Slides** (scientific observation metaphor, discrete magnification levels)
- **Musical Canon** (same melody repeated at different time offsets, emphasizing temporal rhythm)
- [Generate 3 more alternatives specific to YOUR content]

If you explore alternatives and STILL converge to fractal after genuine search, document the alternatives you rejected and why fractal was stronger.

### If Divergence Confirmed (All "Different" boxes checked)

**You successfully diverged. Extract the mechanisms, ignore the layout.**

#### Successful Divergence — What to Do Next

1. **Extract applicable mechanisms** (Section 5 — Reusable list)
   - Review ☑ mechanisms (Dense/Sparse Alternation, Spacing Compression, Border-Weight Gradient, etc.)
   - Select 2-4 most relevant to YOUR metaphor
   - Ignore metaphor-specific decisions (✗ items like "4-level structure", "fractal vocabulary")

2. **Proceed to implementation** (Phase 4 in tension-composition skill)
   - Use mechanisms catalog as toolbox
   - Build YOUR metaphor, not this one
   - Your 4-scale structure might be 3-tier, 6-tier, or continuous gradient

3. **Contribute to library growth**
   - Your metaphor will become a NEW case study
   - Library enriches (more proof points), doesn't repeat

### Regeneration Path (If Pattern-Matching Detected)

**If you realized you pattern-matched AFTER reading this case study:**

1. **Acknowledge it** — Pattern-matching isn't "wrong," but it's NOT creative derivation
2. **Decide:**
   - **Option A:** Accept pattern-match, document as "Adapted from DD-006 fractal case study"
     - Acceptable for low-risk content where creative novelty isn't required
     - Must still apply mechanisms correctly (not copy CSS values blindly)
   - **Option B:** Regenerate with constraint ("fractal is taken, what ELSE works?")
     - Required for high-value content, design system contributions, or published work
3. **If regenerating:**
   - Return to Phase 2 tension table
   - Add constraint: "Fractal self-similarity metaphor is off-limits"
   - Re-run Phase 3 search with constraint active
   - Generate 3+ alternative metaphors (Nested Dolls, Zoom Lens, Microscope, Musical Canon, etc.)
   - Select best alternative based on tension fit (NOT similarity to fractal)
   - Commit to alternative BEFORE re-reading library

**Verification that regeneration worked:**
- Can you describe your metaphor WITHOUT using the word "fractal"?
- Does your metaphor have vocabulary unique to it (not borrowed from DD-006)?
- If someone reads both case studies side-by-side, would they see DIVERGENT solutions, not VARIANTS?

1. WHY THIS EXISTS

R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md captures 51 findings expanding density beyond the
single spatial dimension into six distinct dimensions: temporal, depth,
semantic, cognitive, interaction, and spatial. It was produced on 2026-02-04
by research sub-agent R-3 and serves as the PRIMARY research input for ALL
Density Dimension (DD) explorations (DD-001 through DD-006). This file has
the highest inbound reference count of any research file in the repository,
with citations from RESEARCH-ACTIVE.md, RETROACTIVE-AUDIT-DD-001-006.md,
density-patterns.md, PATTERN-INDEX.md, PIPELINE-MANIFEST.md, BACKBONE.md,
the 109K README.md, multiple STAGE-HEADERs, and DD-outbound-findings.md.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS

"What dimensions of density exist beyond spatial arrangement, and how can
each be independently manipulated to create rhythm, pacing, and cognitive
comfort in documentation showcases?"

3. STATUS

ACTIVE (locked data). 51 findings (R3-001 through R3-051) are complete and
immutable. Approximately 76% of findings have been applied during DD
explorations. The R3-023 to DD-F-006 chain is a critical cross-reference
pathway. No new findings will be added.

# R3: Density Dimensions Research

## Research Agent: R-3
## Focus: Multidimensional Density Beyond Spatial Arrangement
## Date: 2026-02-04

---

## Executive Summary

Density in interface design is typically reduced to a single dimension: spatial density (how many elements per unit area). This research expands density into **six distinct dimensions**, each offering unique design leverage for documentation showcases. The goal is to move beyond "cramped vs spacious" thinking toward a rich vocabulary of density manipulation.

---

## 1. TEMPORAL DENSITY

### 1.1 Definition
Temporal density measures how information unfolds over time and scroll progression. It's the "pacing" of information delivery.

### 1.2 Key Insights

**Insight 1: Scroll Velocity Mapping**
Different content types demand different scroll-to-information ratios:
- **High temporal density**: Information changes rapidly as user scrolls (data tables, API references)
- **Low temporal density**: Information changes slowly, allowing absorption (hero sections, philosophy statements)

**Insight 2: The "First Fold" Paradox**
The first viewport often needs to be simultaneously:
- Low temporal density (welcoming, not overwhelming)
- High semantic density (value proposition must be clear)

This tension drives the need for LAYERED density (see Depth Density).

**Insight 3: Density Rhythm Patterns**

```
Pattern: PULSE
████░░░░████░░░░████░░░░
High-Low-High-Low cycles, like a heartbeat
Best for: Tutorials, learning journeys

Pattern: CRESCENDO
░░░░░███████████████████
Builds from sparse to dense
Best for: Onboarding, complexity reveals

Pattern: BOOKENDS
████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░████
Dense start and end, sparse middle
Best for: Context-Action-Summary structures

Pattern: WAVE
░░██████░░░░████████░░░░
Irregular but rhythmic
Best for: Long-form documentation
```

**Insight 4: Scroll-Triggered Density Shifts**
Using intersection observers to change density as sections come into view. A component can START sparse (overview) and BECOME dense (details) as user commits attention.

### 1.3 Temporal Density Recommendations for Showcase
- Open with low temporal density (the page "breathes in")
- First interaction point should trigger density increase (the page "exhales" information)
- Maintain PULSE pattern for sustained engagement
- End sections with density release (whitespace palate cleanser)

---

## 2. DEPTH DENSITY

### 2.1 Definition
Depth density measures information layering in the z-axis, even in 2D layouts. It's about foreground/background relationships and progressive disclosure.

### 2.2 Key Insights

**Insight 5: The Geological Model**
Information can be stratified like rock layers:
- **Surface layer**: Headlines, icons, primary actions (always visible)
- **Sediment layer**: Supporting text, secondary info (revealed on hover/focus)
- **Bedrock layer**: Full documentation, source code (linked/expandable)

Each layer has its own appropriate density.

**Insight 6: Z-Index as Information Priority**
Higher visual z-index (shadows, overlays, popups) should correlate with LOWER information density. The thing demanding attention should be digestible.

**Insight 7: Progressive Disclosure Density Gradient**
```
Click Depth 0: 3-5 key facts (sparse)
Click Depth 1: 10-15 details (moderate)
Click Depth 2: Full reference (dense)
Click Depth 3+: Source code/raw data (maximum)
```

Each click "drills down" into denser strata.

**Insight 8: The Hover Reveal Anti-Pattern**
High-density content revealed on hover is problematic:
- Touch devices lose access
- Accidental triggers cause cognitive whiplash
- Better: Hover reveals PREVIEWS, click reveals CONTENT

**Insight 9: Shadow Depth as Density Signal**
Deeper shadows (higher elevation) can signal that an element CONTAINS compressed information waiting to expand. Cards with drop shadows are "information icebergs."

### 2.3 Depth Density Recommendations for Showcase
- Use 3 distinct depth levels maximum
- Surface: Pattern names, visual preview
- Sediment: Use cases, quick facts
- Bedrock: Full documentation, code, variations
- Shadows should increase with information potential

---

## 3. SEMANTIC DENSITY

### 3.1 Definition
Semantic density measures meaning per unit area. A single word can be semantically dense ("Kubernetes") or sparse ("the").

### 3.2 Key Insights

**Insight 10: The Jargon Paradox**
High semantic density via jargon is:
- **Efficient** for experts (one term encodes complex concept)
- **Hostile** for novices (meaning is inaccessible)

Showcase components should offer BOTH semantic layers:
- Expert-facing dense labels
- Novice-facing expanded definitions

**Insight 11: Icon Semantic Density**
Icons are semantically dense but:
- Require learned vocabulary
- Fail silently (user doesn't know what they don't know)
- Need label pairing for accessibility and learnability

**Insight 12: Component Type Semantic Ranking**
```
HIGHEST SEMANTIC DENSITY:
- Code snippets (entire behaviors in few characters)
- Mathematical notation
- Technical diagrams

MEDIUM SEMANTIC DENSITY:
- Structured tables
- Lists with hierarchy
- Annotated screenshots

LOWEST SEMANTIC DENSITY:
- Prose paragraphs
- Hero images
- Decorative elements
```

**Insight 13: Semantic Density vs Reading Speed**
High semantic density SLOWS reading but COMPRESSES content. The tradeoff:
- Reference documentation: favor semantic density (experts scan)
- Learning content: favor semantic expansion (novices absorb)

### 3.3 Semantic Density Recommendations for Showcase
- Lead with medium semantic density (accessible but substantive)
- Offer density toggles (simple/advanced views)
- Code blocks are dense islands - surround with explanation whitespace
- Never orphan jargon without context

---

## 4. COGNITIVE DENSITY

### 4.1 Definition
Cognitive density measures mental processing required per unit area. Related to but distinct from semantic density - a simple concept can be presented in a cognitively dense way.

### 4.2 Key Insights

**Insight 14: The Novelty Factor**
Cognitive density = Information + Novelty + Decision Points

A familiar pattern (button, card) has LOW cognitive density.
A novel interaction pattern has HIGH cognitive density regardless of information content.

**Insight 15: Decision Fatigue Zones**
Areas with many interactive choices are cognitively dense:
- Filter bars with 10+ options
- Navigation menus with deep hierarchy
- Forms with conditional logic

These need visual sparsity to offset cognitive density.

**Insight 16: The Explanation Burden**
If something needs explanation, it carries cognitive density debt:
- Tooltip-dependent UI = cognitively dense
- Self-evident UI = cognitively sparse

Showcase patterns should be MORE self-evident than production patterns.

**Insight 17: Color as Cognitive Load**
Each color carrying meaning adds cognitive density:
- 2-3 semantic colors: manageable
- 7+ semantic colors: overwhelming

Showcase should use color sparingly for maximum impact.

**Insight 18: Motion as Cognitive Density**
Animation adds cognitive density:
- Meaningful motion (state change): justified density
- Decorative motion: unjustified density tax

Showcase animations should be DEMONSTRATIVE (showing how components work) not DECORATIVE.

### 4.3 Cognitive Density Recommendations for Showcase
- Favor familiar patterns with novel content over novel patterns
- Limit interactive decisions per viewport to 3-5
- Use animation to EXPLAIN, not decorate
- Maximum 3 semantic colors per section

---

## 5. INTERACTION DENSITY

### 5.1 Definition
Interaction density measures clickable/interactive elements per viewport and the complexity of interactions available.

### 5.2 Key Insights

**Insight 19: The Touch Target Tax**
High interaction density requires:
- Larger touch targets (44px minimum)
- More whitespace between targets
- Creating a VISUAL density ceiling

You cannot have maximum visual density AND maximum interaction density simultaneously.

**Insight 20: Interaction Density Zones**
```
EXPLORATION ZONE: High interaction density
- Many small interactions
- Encourages discovery
- Low commitment per action
Example: Component gallery with hover previews

ACTION ZONE: Low interaction density
- Few, prominent interactions
- Clear primary/secondary hierarchy
- High commitment actions
Example: Pricing page with CTA buttons

READING ZONE: Minimal interaction density
- Text dominates
- Interactions are escape hatches (nav, search)
- Content consumption focus
Example: Long-form documentation
```

**Insight 21: The Playground Pattern**
Dedicated high-interaction zones (code playgrounds, interactive demos) should be:
- Visually bounded (clear "this is interactive" signaling)
- Cognitively isolated (user can ignore until ready)
- Optionally collapsible

**Insight 22: Interaction Depth vs Breadth**
- **Broad**: Many simple interactions (star ratings, toggles)
- **Deep**: Few complex interactions (code editors, drag-drop)

Showcase should favor BREADTH (many pattern interactions) over DEPTH (complex single interactions).

### 5.3 Interaction Density Recommendations for Showcase
- Clear zone demarcation (exploration vs action vs reading)
- Breadth over depth for pattern variety
- Interactive elements should be DISCOVERABLE but not DEMANDING
- Touch-friendly density limits apply even on desktop

---

## 6. DENSITY METAPHORS & FRAMEWORKS

### 6.1 The Breathing Framework
Pages should BREATHE - alternating inhalation (drawing attention in, increasing density) and exhalation (releasing attention, decreasing density).

```
INHALE: Hero section → User attention gathered
EXHALE: Overview grid → Attention distributed
INHALE: Feature deep-dive → Focus narrowed
EXHALE: Gallery view → Browsing mode
INHALE: CTA section → Decision point
EXHALE: Footer → Completion, relaxation
```

### 6.2 The Tidal Framework
Information arrives in WAVES with natural rhythm:
- **High tide**: Dense information arrives
- **Low tide**: Whitespace, absorption time
- **Tidal pools**: Isolated dense pockets (code blocks, data tables) that retain density even at "low tide"

### 6.3 The Musical Framework
Density as DYNAMICS in music:
- **Forte (ff)**: Maximum density moments (comprehensive tables, code)
- **Piano (p)**: Sparse, quiet sections (hero, transitions)
- **Crescendo**: Building density (onboarding flows)
- **Decrescendo**: Releasing density (section conclusions)
- **Staccato**: Sharp density spikes (callouts, alerts)
- **Legato**: Smooth density flows (prose, narratives)

### 6.4 The Fractal Framework
**Insight 23: Self-Similar Density**
Good density patterns are FRACTAL - the same rhythm appears at multiple scales:
- Page level: Dense sections alternate with sparse
- Section level: Dense paragraphs alternate with whitespace
- Component level: Dense labels with sparse backgrounds
- Character level: Dense code with sparse comments

### 6.5 The Geological Framework
**Insight 24: Density Strata**
Information forms layers, with appropriate density at each depth:
- **Atmosphere**: Marketing fluff, decorative (lowest density)
- **Surface**: Headlines, navigation (low density)
- **Topsoil**: Summaries, overviews (medium density)
- **Subsoil**: Detailed content (medium-high density)
- **Bedrock**: Reference, specs, source (highest density)

Users drill DOWN into density by choice.

---

## 7. DENSITY TRANSITIONS

### 7.1 The Gradient Principle
Density should never change ABRUPTLY. Transitions need gradients:
```
BAD:  ████████░░░░░░░░ (jarring cliff)
GOOD: ████████▓▓▓░░░░░ (smooth gradient)
```

### 7.2 Transition Techniques
- **Whitespace Buffers**: Extra margin before/after dense sections
- **Summary Bridges**: Brief text bridging dense zones
- **Visual Dividers**: Horizontal rules that signal density shift
- **Progressive Cards**: Cards that expand/collapse to manage transitions

### 7.3 Density Shock Points
**Insight 25: The Expansion Moment**
When user clicks to expand content, the density shock should be ANTICIPATED:
- Show loading skeleton at expected density
- Animate expansion rather than instant reveal
- Provide "collapse" affordance prominently

---

## 8. SHOWCASE-SPECIFIC DENSITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 Overall Density Architecture
```
SECTION          | Temporal | Depth | Semantic | Cognitive | Interaction
-----------------|----------|-------|----------|-----------|------------
Hero             | Low      | 1     | High     | Low       | Low
Pattern Grid     | Medium   | 2     | Medium   | Medium    | High
Pattern Detail   | High     | 3     | High     | Medium    | Medium
Code Examples    | High     | 2     | Maximum  | High      | Low
CTA/Conclusion   | Low      | 1     | Medium   | Low       | Low
```

### 8.2 Pattern Card Density
Each pattern card should have LAYERED density:
- **Surface**: Name + Icon (sparse)
- **Visible**: 3-word description + preview (medium)
- **Hover/Click**: Full description + variants (dense)

### 8.3 The "10-Second Test"
**Insight 26**: In 10 seconds, user should absorb:
- What the showcase IS (semantic)
- What they CAN DO (interaction)
- Where to GO DEEPER (depth)

This requires LOW cognitive density at the top, with clear density gradients downward.

### 8.4 Density Red Flags to Avoid
- Wall of cards without visual hierarchy
- Code blocks without context whitespace
- Multiple competing interaction zones
- Semantic jargon without progressive disclosure
- Motion that adds cognitive load without teaching

---

## 9. NOVEL DENSITY CONCEPTS

### 9.1 Density Potential
**Insight 27**: An element's "density potential" is how much MORE dense it COULD become. A collapsed accordion has high density potential. An expanded one has realized that potential.

Showcase should visually signal density potential (expansion affordances, "more" indicators).

### 9.2 Density Inheritance
**Insight 28**: Child elements inherit density context from parents. A card inside a dense section FEELS denser than the same card in a sparse section. Design cards for their CONTEXT, not in isolation.

### 9.3 Density Contrast
**Insight 29**: Density is RELATIVE. A medium-density element feels dense after sparse content, sparse after dense content. Use this for emphasis: surround key information with contrasting density.

### 9.4 Density Debt
**Insight 30**: Every dense element creates "density debt" - the user needs recovery space. Fail to pay this debt and users experience fatigue. The debt is paid with whitespace, visual calm, and processing time.

---

## 10. SYNTHESIS: THE DENSITY MANIFOLD

Density is not a single dimension but a MANIFOLD - a multi-dimensional surface where each point represents a specific combination of density types.

**The Ideal Showcase Point on the Manifold:**
- Temporal: RHYTHMIC (pulse pattern)
- Depth: 3-LAYERED (surface/sediment/bedrock)
- Semantic: TIERED (novice/expert modes)
- Cognitive: FAMILIAR-NOVEL (known patterns, new content)
- Interaction: ZONED (exploration/action/reading areas)

**Navigation Through the Manifold:**
As users interact, they move through the density manifold:
- Scrolling moves through temporal density
- Clicking moves through depth density
- Learning reduces cognitive density
- Exploration maps interaction density

The showcase should provide CLEAR NAVIGATION through this manifold - users should always know:
- Where they ARE (current density state)
- Where they CAN GO (available density transitions)
- How to RETURN (density escape routes)

---

1. WHY THIS EXISTS

R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md captures 39 findings establishing the theoretical
framework for how KortAI's 11 documentation components should combine,
covering harmony, tension, sequence, grouping, nesting, and meta-relationships.
It was produced on 2026-02-04 by research sub-agent R-5 and uniquely bridges
external research with internal design-extraction references (PERCEPTUAL-TRUTHS.md,
CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE.md, batch-04-heavy-cross.html, COMPONENTS-REGISTRY.md).
It serves as the PRIMARY research input for the Combination Dimension (CD)
stage (Stage 5) of the KortAI showcase pipeline.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS

"How should KortAI's 11 documentation components combine — what creates
harmony, what creates productive tension, what sequencing and grouping rules
should govern component choreography?"

3. STATUS

ACTIVE (locked data). 39 findings (R5-001 through R5-039) are complete and
immutable. No new findings will be added. CD explorations have not yet begun;
findings remain largely unapplied.

# R5-COMBINATION-THEORY
## Component Combination Principles for KortAI Documentation

**Research Agent:** R-5
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Sources:** PERCEPTUAL-TRUTHS.md, CHARACTER-FAMILY-COMPLETE.md, batch-04-heavy-cross.html, COMPONENTS-REGISTRY.md

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the theoretical framework for how KortAI's 11 documentation components should combine. It addresses harmony (what goes together), tension (productive contrast), sequence (ordering), grouping (spatial relationships), nesting (containment), and meta-relationships (moods, voices, kinship).

The core insight: **Components are not interchangeable puzzle pieces.** Each has a character, a density signature, and a structural role. Combination is choreography, not collision.

---

## Part 1: Component Harmony

### Principle H1: Family Cohesion Through Shared DNA

Components within the same family combine seamlessly because they share structural DNA.

**Callout Family (Info, Tip, Gotcha, Essence, Challenge):**
- Same zone structure (label + body + left accent)
- Same spacing rhythm (24px top, 28px bottom asymmetric)
- Same typography pattern (uppercase label, sans-serif body)
- **Harmony mechanism:** Color differentiation creates semantic variety within structural unity

**Example — Natural Callout Sequence:**
```
[Info Callout] — "Before you begin..."
[Tip Callout] — "You can also try..."
[Gotcha Callout] — "Watch out for..."
```

This reads as a cohesive advisory unit, not three separate interruptions.

### Principle H2: Contrast Creates Perceived Harmony

Paradoxically, high-contrast pairings can feel harmonious when they fulfill complementary roles.

**High-Harmony Contrasting Pairs:**

| Pair | Contrast Type | Harmony Mechanism |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Code Snippet + Essence Callout | Dark/Light, Technical/Philosophical | Philosophy explains code's "why" |
| File Tree + Decision Matrix | Dense/Open, Vertical/Horizontal | Map → Options pattern |
| Task Component + Reasoning | Action/Deliberation | Tasks emerge from reasoning |

**Why this works:** The contrast is *functional*, not decorative. Each component answers a question the other raises.

### Principle H3: Shared Visual Anchors

Components harmonize when they share visual anchor points:

**Left-Anchored Components:**
- All Callouts (left border flag)
- File Tree (left border)
- Decision Matrix (left border)
- Code Snippet (no anchor, but dark mass creates left-edge gravity)

**Framed Components:**
- Core Abstraction (1px frame)
- Reasoning Component (1px frame)

**Recommendation:** When mixing anchored and framed components, place anchored components before framed components. The left-anchor creates reading momentum; the frame signals "pause and consider."

### Finding H4: The "Editorial Spread" Pattern

Components that feel like they belong on the same magazine spread:
- **File Tree + Core Abstraction** — Structure map + principle explanation
- **Decision Matrix + Reasoning** — Options + deliberation
- **Code Snippet + Tip Callout** — Example + practical advice
- **Essence Callout + Challenge Callout** — Wisdom + action prompt

These pairs have complementary *editorial roles* — one sets up, one pays off.

---

## Part 2: Component Tension

### Principle T1: Productive Tension vs. Jarring Collision

Tension is useful when it creates *cognitive pause* without *cognitive dissonance*.

**Productive Tension Examples:**

| Pair | Tension Source | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Gotcha Callout + Code Snippet | Warning before example | "Don't do this" → "This is wrong" |
| Essence Callout + Reasoning | Axiom + Deliberation | "The principle" → "But consider..." |
| Task Component + Gotcha | Action list + Hazard | "Do these things" → "But not this way" |

**Jarring Collision Examples:**

| Pair | Why It Fails | Effect |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Essence + Essence (consecutive) | Axiom fatigue | Dilutes importance of both |
| Gotcha + Gotcha (consecutive) | Alarm fatigue | Reader tunes out warnings |
| Code Snippet + Code Snippet (no separation) | No breathing room | Wall of code, no comprehension |
| Reasoning + Reasoning (consecutive) | Decision paralysis | Too many forks without resolution |

### Principle T2: The Velocity Mismatch Rule

Components have reading velocities:
- **Fast:** Callouts (quick scan), Tasks (checklist scan)
- **Medium:** Decision Matrix (columnar scan), File Tree (structured scan)
- **Slow:** Code Snippet (line-by-line), Reasoning (deliberate), Core Abstraction (contemplative)

**Rule:** Avoid placing two SLOW components consecutively without a FAST component between them.

**Bad:**
```
[Reasoning Component] — 2 columns of analysis
[Core Abstraction] — Philosophy + code
[Code Snippet] — 40 lines of example
```
This creates reader fatigue. Insert breathing room:

**Good:**
```
[Reasoning Component] — 2 columns of analysis
[Tip Callout] — "Given the above, start with Option A"
[Core Abstraction] — Philosophy + code
[Code Snippet] — 40 lines of example
```

### Principle T3: Semantic Dissonance

Components have semantic temperatures:
- **Warm:** Tip (friendly), Challenge (inviting), Essence (reverent)
- **Neutral:** Info, File Tree, Decision Matrix, Code Snippet
- **Cold:** Gotcha (warning), Task (utilitarian)

**Rule:** Don't oscillate rapidly between warm and cold.

**Dissonant:**
```
[Tip Callout] — "Here's a friendly tip!"
[Gotcha Callout] — "DANGER: This will break your system"
[Challenge Callout] — "Try this fun experiment!"
```

**Better:**
```
[Tip Callout] — "Here's a friendly tip!"
[Code Snippet] — Example of the tip
[Gotcha Callout] — "But avoid this common mistake"
```

The neutral Code Snippet acts as a *temperature buffer*.

### Finding T4: The 2-Callout Limit

**Never place more than 2 callouts consecutively.** After 2 callouts, readers experience "sidebar fatigue" — the margin annotation loses its power to interrupt.

If you need 3+ advisories:
1. Group them into a single Info Callout with bullets
2. Interleave with prose or code
3. Use a Decision Matrix to compare the considerations

---

## Part 3: Sequence Patterns

### Principle S1: The Setup-Payoff Arc

Every documentation section should have a narrative arc:

**Classic Pattern:**
1. **Context** — Info Callout or prose (where are we?)
2. **Map** — File Tree or Decision Matrix (what are the options?)
3. **Principle** — Essence Callout or Core Abstraction (why does this matter?)
4. **Demonstration** — Code Snippet (show me)
5. **Action** — Task Component or Challenge Callout (what do I do?)
6. **Hazards** — Gotcha Callout (what can go wrong?)

**Not every section needs all 6**, but they should appear in this order when present.

### Principle S2: Density Wave Sequencing

Page density should follow a wave pattern, not a plateau:

```
LOW  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
     │ Intro │ Example │ Reflection │ Next │
MED  ████░░░░░░░░░████████░░░░░░░░░░██████
HIGH ░░░░░░████████░░░░░░░░░████████░░░░░░
```

**Translation:**
1. Start LOW (orientation, callout)
2. Build to HIGH (code block, file tree)
3. Release to LOW-MED (callout, prose)
4. Build again if section continues

**Anti-pattern:** Starting with Code Snippet (reader has no context) or ending with Code Snippet (no resolution).

### Principle S3: The First Component Rule

The first component on a page or section sets the *tone*:

| First Component | Sets Tone Of |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Info Callout | Helpful guide |
| Code Snippet | Technical reference |
| Essence Callout | Philosophical treatise |
| Task Component | Practical tutorial |
| Decision Matrix | Decision-making guide |
| Gotcha Callout | Troubleshooting guide |

**Choose deliberately.** A section starting with Code Snippet says "we assume you know what this is." A section starting with Info Callout says "let me orient you first."

### Principle S4: The Resolution Component

Sections should end with *resolution*, not *tension*:

| Good Endings | Bad Endings |
|--------------|-------------|
| Task Component (clear next steps) | Gotcha Callout (anxiety without action) |
| Challenge Callout (invitation to practice) | Reasoning Component (open question) |
| Tip Callout (parting wisdom) | Code Snippet (no interpretation) |
| Prose summary | Decision Matrix (options but no guidance) |

**Exception:** Reasoning Component is acceptable as an ending when the recommendation zone provides clear guidance.

### Finding S5: The "Teaching Moment" Sequence

When explaining a concept, use this proven sequence:

```
[Essence Callout] — "The core principle"
[Core Abstraction] — Principle + minimal code proof
[Code Snippet] — Full implementation example
[Tip Callout] — Practical advice for applying it
```

This moves from abstract → concrete → practical, matching how developers process new concepts.

---

## Part 4: Grouping Principles

### Principle G1: Semantic Proximity

Related components should be visually proximate:

**Tight Grouping (8-16px gap):**
- Code Snippet + its explanatory Tip Callout
- Decision Matrix + Reasoning Component analyzing the options
- File Tree + Core Abstraction explaining the structure

**Standard Grouping (24-32px gap):**
- Between different topics within a section
- Between prose and component

**Section Break (48-64px gap):**
- Between major conceptual sections
- Before/after a "teaching moment" sequence

### Principle G2: The Container Signal

**Framed components (Core Abstraction, Reasoning) signal completeness.** They say: "This is a bounded thought."

**Anchored components (Callouts, Decision Matrix) signal annotation.** They say: "This relates to what's around it."

**Grouping implication:** Don't place two framed components adjacent without a non-framed component between them. Two bounded thoughts need connective tissue.

```
[Core Abstraction] — Bounded teaching moment
[Tip Callout] — "In practice, this means..." ← Connection
[Reasoning Component] — Bounded deliberation
```

### Principle G3: Visual Weight Balance

Components have visual weight:

| Weight | Components |
|--------|------------|
| Heavy | Code Snippet (dark mass), Reasoning (large frame), Core Abstraction (frame + dark code) |
| Medium | Decision Matrix, Task Component, File Tree |
| Light | All Callouts (left anchor only, no full container) |

**Rule:** Balance heavy components with light ones. A page of all-heavy components feels oppressive. A page of all-light components feels insubstantial.

**Golden Ratio:** For every heavy component, include 1-2 light components before the next heavy component.

### Finding G4: The "Advisory Cluster"

When multiple advisories relate to the same concept, group them:

**Instead of scattered:**
```
[Prose about X]
[Gotcha about X]
[Prose about Y]
[Tip about X]
[Code for X]
```

**Use an advisory cluster:**
```
[Prose about X]
[Info Callout] — Context for X
[Tip Callout] — Advice for X
[Gotcha Callout] — Warning about X
[Code for X]
```

The cluster reads as a single "advisory moment" rather than scattered interruptions.

---

## Part 5: Nesting vs. Stacking

### Principle N1: Components Generally Stack, Not Nest

KortAI components are designed to **stack vertically**, not nest within each other. The flat, editorial design philosophy rejects deep nesting.

**Stack (Correct):**
```
[Core Abstraction]
  └── Contains embedded Code Snippet (allowed, this is intentional composite design)

[Reasoning Component]
  └── Amber summary zone at bottom (built-in, not nested component)
```

**Nest (Incorrect):**
```
[Info Callout containing [Code Snippet]]  ← NO
[Task Component containing [Tip Callout]] ← NO
```

### Principle N2: Composite Components Are Pre-Composed

Two components are explicitly composites:
- **Core Abstraction** = Essence-style quote + Code Snippet
- **Reasoning Component** = Question + Two-column comparison + Summary

These are *intentionally designed* composites. Don't create ad-hoc composites by nesting.

### Principle N3: When Nesting Feels Necessary, Re-sequence

If you feel the urge to nest components, it usually means they should be sequential:

**Urge:** "I want a Tip Callout inside this Code Snippet to explain line 5."

**Solution:** Place the Tip Callout before or after the Code Snippet, reference the line number:
```
[Tip Callout] — "In line 5 below, notice how we..."
[Code Snippet]
```

**Urge:** "I want a Gotcha inside this Task Component item."

**Solution:** Add the Gotcha after the task list:
```
[Task Component]
[Gotcha Callout] — "When completing task 3, avoid..."
```

### Finding N4: The Depth Limit

Maximum effective depth is **1 level**:
- Component → Embedded zone (e.g., Core Abstraction → Code zone)
- Page → Components
- Section → Components

Beyond this, complexity exceeds editorial restraint.

---

## Part 6: Component Relationships

### Framework R1: Kinship Model

Components have relationships analogous to family structures:

**Siblings (Same Family DNA):**
- Info, Tip, Gotcha, Essence, Challenge (Callout siblings)
- Code Snippet, File Tree (Technical siblings)
- Decision Matrix, Reasoning Component (Analytical siblings)

**Parent-Child (Composite Containment):**
- Core Abstraction is parent to Essence-style quote (child) and Code Snippet (child)
- Reasoning Component is parent to Question zone, Columns, and Summary zone

**Cousins (Shared Traits, Different Families):**
- Essence Callout & Core Abstraction — both use serif italic, reverent tone
- Task Component & Decision Matrix — both create structured lists/grids
- File Tree & Code Snippet — both use monospace typography

### Framework R2: Component Moods

Components have emotional valences:

| Component | Primary Mood | Secondary Mood |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Info Callout | Helpful | Neutral |
| Tip Callout | Friendly | Encouraging |
| Gotcha Callout | Urgent | Protective |
| Essence Callout | Reverent | Contemplative |
| Challenge Callout | Inviting | Playful |
| Code Snippet | Authoritative | Technical |
| File Tree | Methodical | Comprehensive |
| Decision Matrix | Impartial | Systematic |
| Core Abstraction | Wise | Teaching |
| Task Component | Productive | Focused |
| Reasoning Component | Deliberate | Balanced |

**Mood Combinations:**
- **Contemplative + Teaching:** Essence → Core Abstraction (builds depth)
- **Urgent + Productive:** Gotcha → Task (protect then act)
- **Inviting + Technical:** Challenge → Code Snippet (explore by doing)

### Framework R3: Component Voices

If components spoke, they would have distinct voices:

| Component | Voice Register | Speaking Style |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Info Callout | Professional concierge | "Allow me to mention..." |
| Tip Callout | Experienced colleague | "Between us, I've found..." |
| Gotcha Callout | Vigilant advisor | "Stop. This matters." |
| Essence Callout | Wise archivist | "If you remember nothing else..." |
| Challenge Callout | Enthusiastic mentor | "Try this, it's interesting..." |
| Code Snippet | Silent transcriptionist | *Says nothing, shows everything* |
| File Tree | Methodical librarian | "Everything has its place." |
| Decision Matrix | Impartial cartographer | "Here are your options." |
| Core Abstraction | Sagacious teacher | "The principle. Now watch." |
| Task Component | Efficient assistant | "Here's what to do." |
| Reasoning Component | Thoughtful counselor | "Consider both sides. My guidance: ..." |

**Voice Harmony Rule:** Don't follow an enthusiastic voice with an authoritative voice immediately. Provide transition.

```
[Challenge Callout] — "Try this fun experiment!"
[Prose transition] — "When you do, you'll notice..."
[Code Snippet] — The example
```

---

## Part 7: Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A1: Callout Cacophony

**Pattern:**
```
[Info Callout]
[Tip Callout]
[Gotcha Callout]
[Challenge Callout]
```

**Why it fails:** The margin annotation loses its interruption power. Reader experiences "sidebar blindness."

**Fix:** Limit to 2 consecutive callouts. Interleave with prose or code.

### Anti-Pattern A2: Code Wall

**Pattern:**
```
[Code Snippet — 50 lines]
[Code Snippet — 30 lines]
[Code Snippet — 45 lines]
```

**Why it fails:** No interpretation, no breathing room, no comprehension scaffolding.

**Fix:** Interleave with explanatory callouts or prose. Maximum 40-50 lines per snippet before commentary.

### Anti-Pattern A3: Decision Paralysis

**Pattern:**
```
[Decision Matrix — 5 options]
[Reasoning Component — "Option A vs B"]
[Reasoning Component — "Option B vs C"]
[Reasoning Component — "Option C vs D"]
```

**Why it fails:** Too many decision forks without resolution. Reader can't synthesize.

**Fix:** One Decision Matrix → One Reasoning Component with clear recommendation. If more options need analysis, create separate sections.

### Anti-Pattern A4: Orphaned Heavy Components

**Pattern:**
```
[Prose paragraph]
[Core Abstraction]
[Next section header]
```

**Why it fails:** Heavy component (Core Abstraction) needs decompression. Jumping to next section feels abrupt.

**Fix:** Add a Tip Callout or prose summary after heavy components:
```
[Prose paragraph]
[Core Abstraction]
[Tip Callout] — "In practice, this principle means..."
[Next section header]
```

### Anti-Pattern A5: Temperature Whiplash

**Pattern:**
```
[Essence Callout] — Reverent wisdom
[Gotcha Callout] — DANGER! WARNING!
[Challenge Callout] — Have fun trying this!
```

**Why it fails:** Emotional register oscillates too rapidly. Reader experiences tonal dissonance.

**Fix:** Use neutral components (Code Snippet, prose) as temperature buffers between warm and cold components.

### Anti-Pattern A6: Missing Context Start

**Pattern:**
```
# Section: Authentication
[Code Snippet — JWT implementation]
```

**Why it fails:** No orientation. Reader doesn't know what they're looking at or why.

**Fix:**
```
# Section: Authentication
[Info Callout] — "This section covers JWT token generation..."
[Code Snippet — JWT implementation]
```

### Anti-Pattern A7: Anxiety Ending

**Pattern:**
```
[Code Snippet — Implementation]
[Gotcha Callout] — "This will fail if X happens"
[End of section]
```

**Why it fails:** Section ends on anxiety without resolution. Reader left worried.

**Fix:**
```
[Code Snippet — Implementation]
[Gotcha Callout] — "This will fail if X happens"
[Tip Callout] — "To prevent this, always verify..."
[End of section]
```

## Part 9: Quantitative Guidelines

### Guideline Q1: Component Density Limits

| Page Length | Max Heavy Components | Max Callouts | Max Code Snippets |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Short (< 500 words) | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| Medium (500-1500 words) | 2-3 | 5-6 | 4-5 |
| Long (> 1500 words) | 4-5 | 8-10 | 6-8 |

### Guideline Q2: Spacing Standards

| Relationship | Gap |
|--------------|-----|
| Related components (e.g., Code + explaining Tip) | 16px |
| Standard separation | 24px |
| Different topics | 32px |
| Section break | 48px |

### Guideline Q3: Reading Rhythm Ratios

For a balanced page:
- **Heavy components:** 20-30% of component count
- **Medium components:** 30-40% of component count
- **Light components:** 30-40% of component count

## Part 10: Summary of Findings

### The 20 Core Findings

1. **Family DNA creates natural harmony** — Callouts combine seamlessly because they share structural DNA
2. **Functional contrast is harmonious** — Philosophy explaining code feels unified, not dissonant
3. **Left-anchored components create reading momentum** — Place before framed components
4. **Framed components signal pause** — Use them for "bounded thoughts" requiring contemplation
5. **Two-callout limit prevents sidebar fatigue** — Never more than 2 consecutive callouts
6. **Velocity mismatch causes fatigue** — Insert FAST components between consecutive SLOW components
7. **Temperature buffers prevent whiplash** — Neutral components between warm and cold
8. **Setup-payoff arc structures sections** — Context → Map → Principle → Demo → Action → Hazards
9. **Density should wave, not plateau** — Alternate high and low density
10. **First component sets section tone** — Choose deliberately based on intent
11. **Sections need resolution endings** — Don't end on anxiety (Gotcha) or ambiguity (Decision Matrix)
12. **Teaching moment sequence is proven** — Essence → Core Abstraction → Code → Tip
13. **Semantic proximity requires tight spacing** — Related components should be visually close
14. **Heavy components need breathing room** — Follow with light components
15. **Advisory clusters reduce scatter** — Group related callouts together
16. **Components stack, don't nest** — Flat editorial design, maximum depth of 1
17. **Composite components are pre-designed** — Don't create ad-hoc nesting
18. **Components have moods** — Combine compatible moods, buffer incompatible ones
19. **Components have voices** — Don't follow enthusiastic with authoritative without transition
20. **Anti-patterns are specific and avoidable** — Callout cacophony, code wall, decision paralysis, orphaned heavy components, temperature whiplash, missing context, anxiety endings

INLINE THREADING HEADER — Phase 2B
File: docs-spa/app/showcase/research/RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md
Tier: A | Batch: 4 | Generated: 2026-02-06
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. WHY THIS EXISTS

RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md is the cross-research unification document that distills
the 337 findings from five parallel research agents (R1-R5) into a coherent
set of design principles, implementation frameworks, and strategic insights.
It was produced on 2026-02-04 after all five research streams completed. Its
authority derives from being the ONLY file that synthesizes across all research
dimensions (documentation patterns, creative layouts, density dimensions, axis
innovations, combination theory) into unified actionable principles. It serves
as the mandatory pre-read for any exploration or section build.

2. THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS

"What unified design principles emerge when all five research dimensions are
synthesized together, and how should these principles govern the KortAI
showcase pipeline?"

3. STATUS

ACTIVE (locked data). Synthesis conclusions are stable. The underlying R1-R5
data is immutable. This synthesis may be extended if new cross-research
insights emerge during future exploration stages (AD, CD) but existing
principles will not be modified.

4. SOUL ALIGNMENT

Soul-adjacent, not soul-implementing. This file synthesizes external research
that feeds into soul-constrained work but does not itself implement or enforce
soul tokens (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none, KortAI color palette). The
research principles it contains INFORM the soul-constrained design decisions
made during explorations and section builds, but the soul enforcement happens
at the exploration and build level, not at the research synthesis level.

5. BUILT ON

Source                          | Role                      | Key Values                                                    | Path
R1-DOCUMENTATION-PATTERNS.md   | Research input (28 findings)  | Density rhythm, whitespace, typography hierarchy, viewport rule   | docs-spa/app/showcase/research/R1-DOCUMENTATION-PATTERNS.md
R2-CREATIVE-LAYOUTS.md          | Research input (27 findings)  | Broken grid, pull quotes, editorial asymmetry, magazine layout    | docs-spa/app/showcase/research/R2-CREATIVE-LAYOUTS.md
R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md        | Research input (51 findings)  | Six density dimensions (temporal, depth, semantic, cognitive, interaction, spatial) | docs-spa/app/showcase/research/R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md
R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS.md          | Research input (192 findings) | Z/F/Gutenberg patterns, bento grid, spiral/diagonal movement     | docs-spa/app/showcase/research/R4-AXIS-INNOVATIONS.md
R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md        | Research input (39 findings)  | Component harmony, tension, sequencing, grouping, nesting         | docs-spa/app/showcase/research/R5-COMBINATION-THEORY.md
DD explorations (DD-001 to DD-006) | Validation source        | Exploration outcomes that tested R3 findings in practice          | docs-spa/app/showcase/explorations/DD-*/

6. MUST HONOR

#  | Constraint                                          | Rationale
1  | Do not modify synthesis conclusions unilaterally     | 5-8 downstream files depend on these principles for scoping and checkpoint tracking
2  | All principle attributions (R-X + R-Y) must be accurate | Traceability to source research streams must be maintained
3  | Cross-research principle numbering must remain stable | FINDINGS-INDEX.md and checkpoint files reference principle numbers
4  | Soul alignment is "adjacent" not "implementing"      | This file must not claim soul enforcement authority it does not have

7. WHAT BREAKS IF THIS CHANGES

Changing synthesis conclusions would affect:
- showcase/checkpoints/ tracking files that reference synthesis principles
- All future exploration scoping that uses synthesis as the strategic frame
- FINDINGS-INDEX.md cross-references to unified principles
- showcase/CLAUDE.md mandatory pre-read requirement (agents would load stale mental models)
- Any checkpoint verification that tests whether explorations align with synthesis
Blast radius: MEDIUM (5-8 inbound references). Changes would not break file integrity
but would create semantic drift between strategy and execution.

9. RESEARCH DEBT

- R2 count discrepancy: CLAUDE.md claims 78 R2 findings but only 27 exist in R2 file.
  This means the synthesis may reference R2 findings by number ranges that do not exist.
  Impact: LOW (synthesis references R2 by theme, not by individual finding ID).
- AD stage findings (192) are entirely unapplied. Synthesis principles derived from R4
  are currently theoretical and unvalidated by exploration. Impact: MEDIUM (Principles 2
  and related axis content have no exploration evidence yet).
- CD stage findings (39) are also unapplied. R5-derived synthesis is unvalidated.
  Impact: MEDIUM (Principle 3 on component combination lacks exploration evidence).

10. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

Q1: Does every unified principle in this file correctly attribute its source
    research streams (e.g., "R-1 + R-3" for Density as Rhythm)?
Q2: Can showcase/CLAUDE.md's mandatory pre-read list be satisfied — does this
    file exist and contain the expected synthesis structure?
Q3: Do the DD exploration outcomes (DD-001 through DD-006) align with the
    density-related synthesis principles stated here?
Q4: Are there any synthesis conclusions that reference R2 finding IDs above
    R2-027 (which would be invalid given the actual count)?
Q5: Is the soul alignment characterization ("adjacent, not implementing")
    consistent with how downstream STAGE-HEADERs reference this file?

# RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS
## Unified Framework from All 5 Research Agents

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Sources:** R1-R5 Research Documents

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Cross-Research Synthesis

Five parallel research agents explored distinct dimensions of showcase design:
- **R-1:** Documentation patterns from premium sites (Stripe, Vercel, Linear, Notion)
- **R-2:** Creative layouts from magazines, dashboards, design systems
- **R-3:** Density dimensions beyond spatial (temporal, depth, semantic, cognitive, interaction)
- **R-4:** Axis innovations (Z, F, Gutenberg, bento, spiral)
- **R-5:** Component combination theory (harmony, tension, sequence, grouping)

### The Master Insight

> **"The best documentation showcases treat layout as content, not container. Components are characters in a narrative, not items in a list. Density has rhythm. Axes have choreography. Combinations have chemistry."**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## UNIFIED DESIGN PRINCIPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Principle 1: Density as Rhythm (R-1 + R-3)

**Synthesis:** Premium docs use density rhythm (HIGH→LOW→HIGH cycles). R-3 extends this to 6 dimensions.

| Dimension | Application to Showcase |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Spatial | Component count per viewport |
| Temporal | Information reveal over scroll |
| Depth | Progressive disclosure layers |
| Semantic | Meaning per unit area |
| Cognitive | Mental processing required |
| Interaction | Interactive elements per viewport |

**Implementation:** Each section should have a density "signature" across all 6 dimensions:

```
Section 1 (Catalog): LOW spatial, HIGH semantic, MEDIUM temporal
Section 3 (Density): Variable spatial, LOW cognitive, MEDIUM interaction
Section 6 (Stress): HIGH all dimensions (deliberate challenge)
```

### Principle 2: Layout as Choreography (R-2 + R-4)

**Synthesis:** Magazine layouts "break the grid" intentionally. Axis patterns guide eye movement.

| Pattern | When to Use | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Z-Pattern | Hero sections, overview pages | R-4 |
| F-Pattern | Text-heavy content, references | R-4 |
| Bento Grid | Component catalog, visual variety | R-2, R-4 |
| Bookends | Context→Action→Summary structures | R-3 |
| PULSE | Tutorials, learning journeys | R-3 |

**Implementation:** Match axis pattern to section purpose:
- Section 1 (Catalog): Bento grid for visual overview
- Section 4 (Axis): Demonstrate each pattern explicitly
- Section 5 (Structures): F-pattern for detailed patterns

### Principle 3: Components as Characters (R-5 + KortAI Soul)

**Synthesis:** Components have personality traits that affect combination chemistry.

| Component | Velocity | Temperature | Weight |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Code Snippet | SLOW | Neutral | Heavy |
| Info Callout | FAST | Neutral | Light |
| Tip Callout | FAST | Warm | Light |
| Gotcha Callout | FAST | Cold | Medium |
| Essence Callout | SLOW | Warm/Reverent | Medium |
| Challenge Callout | FAST | Warm | Medium |
| File Tree | MEDIUM | Neutral | Heavy |
| Decision Matrix | MEDIUM | Neutral | Heavy |
| Core Abstraction | SLOW | Reverent | Heavy |
| Task Component | FAST | Utilitarian | Medium |
| Reasoning | SLOW | Deliberate | Heavy |

**Implementation:** Never stack same-temperature or same-velocity consecutively without buffer.

### Principle 4: Whitespace as Design Element (R-1 + R-2)

**Synthesis:** 38% retention improvement from smart whitespace. "Tech Spec" aesthetic aligns with KortAI.

**Specific Guidance:**
- 24px between related components
- 48px between different sections
- 92px+ hero margins
- One major concept per viewport

### Principle 5: Editorial Confidence Through Typography (R-1 + R-2 + KortAI)

**Synthesis:** Typography creates hierarchy without decoration. Sharp edges = confidence.

**Type Hierarchy:**
1. Size (largest = most important)
2. Weight (bold = emphasis)
3. Color (red accent = attention)
4. Space (more space = more important)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## CONFLICTING INSIGHTS + RESOLUTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Conflict 1: Grid Breaking vs. Sharp Edges

**R-2 Finding:** "Breaking the grid" creates visual interest and signals human design.
**KortAI Soul:** Sharp edges, flat design, editorial precision.

**Resolution:** Break the grid with CONTENT positioning, not with DECORATION. Use:
- Pull quotes that bleed margins
- Full-width components that span columns
- Asymmetric spacing between sections
- **NOT** rounded corners, shadows, or decorative elements

### Conflict 2: Progressive Disclosure vs. Flat Design

**R-3 Finding:** Depth density uses progressive disclosure with hover reveals.
**KortAI Soul:** Flat design, no shadows.

**Resolution:** Use progressive disclosure through:
- Expandable/collapsible sections (flat toggles, not 3D buttons)
- Scroll-based reveals (content appears on scroll)
- Click-to-expand (not hover-to-reveal)
- **NOT** shadow elevation for depth signaling

### Conflict 3: Density Maximization vs. Breathing Room

**R-3 Finding:** High semantic density is efficient for experts.
**R-1 Finding:** Whitespace improves retention by 38%.

**Resolution:** Vary density by SECTION PURPOSE:
- Reference sections: HIGH density acceptable
- Learning sections: LOW density, generous whitespace
- Stress tests: HIGH density (deliberate showcase of limits)

## 1. Who is Steve Yegge?

### Professional Background

Steve Yegge is a 40-year software development veteran with a career that provides unique credibility for building Gas Town:

| Company | Role | Relevance |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Amazon** | Early employee | Built internal tools at scale |
| **Google** | Senior Engineer | Famous for "Stevey's Blog Rants," internal platforms |
| **Sourcegraph** | Senior role | Code intelligence, developer tooling |
| **Current** | Full-time AI development advocate | Building the future of agent-assisted dev |

### Why His Opinion Matters

- **~1 million lines vibe-coded in 2025** - Not theory, practice
- **Built Beads (225K lines of Go)** - Proof of concept at scale
- **Built Gas Town using Gas Town** - Recursive validation
- **Transparent about limitations** - Warns about chaos, costs, maturity
- **Decades of platform engineering** - Knows what scales and what breaks

### Public Presence

- **Twitter/X:** @steve_yegge (primary announcements)
- **Medium:** steve-yegge.medium.com (deep philosophical pieces)
- **GitHub:** github.com/steveyegge (Gas Town, Beads, MCP Agent Mail)
- **Podcasts:** Changelog, O'Reilly Radar

### The "Vibe Coding" Pioneer

Steve didn't just adopt AI-assisted development - he pioneered "vibe coding" as a philosophy:

> "Work becomes fluid, an uncountable that you sling around freely, like slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels at the docks."

**Vibe coding principles:**
- Describe what you want (the "vibe")
- AI generates the code
- You never read the code directly
- Judge by outcomes, not implementation
- Accept some bugs, focus on throughput

---

## 2. The Gas Town Mental Model

### The Core Insight

> "Claude Code is the world's biggest fuckin' ant. Everyone is focused on making their ant run longer... when nature prefers colonies."

This is the fundamental shift Gas Town represents:

```
TRADITIONAL APPROACH                 GAS TOWN APPROACH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━                ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

     One Big Ant                     Ant Colony
         |                               |
    Make it                        Build the
    run longer                     factory
         |                               |
    Context window               Multiple workers
    limits everything            share the load
         |                               |
    You are the                  You are the
    programmer                   Product Manager
```

### The Factory Metaphor

Gas Town isn't an agent - it's a **factory for agents**:

| Traditional Dev | Gas Town |
|-----------------|----------|
| You write code | You file features |
| You debug | Agents debug |
| You're the implementer | You're the PM |
| Single context window | Many workers, shared memory |
| Session ends, context lost | Workers persist, memory survives |

### The "Idea Compiler"

> "Gas Town is an Idea Compiler. You just make up features, design them, file the implementation plans, and sling work around to your polecats and crew."

**Input:** Your ideas and feature requests
**Output:** Working code, shipped products

You're not writing code anymore. You're managing a factory.

### Why "Gas Town"?

The Mad Max: Fury Road reference isn't accidental:

- **Post-apocalyptic resourcefulness** - Work with chaos, not against it
- **Clear role hierarchy** - Mayor, Deacon, Dogs, Workers
- **Survival-focused** - Throughput over perfection
- **Community-built** - Everyone contributes to the economy

**Responsibilities:**
- Receives high-level directives from Overseer
- Routes work to appropriate rigs
- Manages cross-rig coordination
- Handles town-level decisions
- Primary AI coordinator for the entire town

**Commands:**
```bash
gt mayor up        # Start mayor

- Execute assigned tasks
- Maintain context across sessions
- Specialize in rig-specific knowledge
- Report completion to Refinery
- Ephemeral but can be persistent workspaces

**Commands:**
```bash
gt polecat up <rig> alice      # Start polecat named "alice"
gt polecat up <rig> bob        # Start polecat named "bob"
gt polecat list <rig>          # List polecats for rig
gt polecat assign alice <task> # Assign task to alice
```

**Naming convention:** Human names (alice, bob, carol) help with mental model

**Model recommendation:** Sonnet (implementation work, main workhorse)

---

#### 6. Witness (Per-Rig Observer)

**Function:** Observes and records rig activity - watches over polecats

**Responsibilities:**
- Watches all work in assigned rig
- Records history and context
- Provides state to new workers
- Reports anomalies to Deacon
- Unsticks drifting agents

**Commands:**
```bash
gt witness up <rig>    # Start witness for rig
gt witness report      # Get current state report
```

**Model recommendation:** Haiku (observation and logging don't need heavy reasoning)

---

#### 7. Crew (Ephemeral Workers)

**Function:** Short-lived, task-specific burst workers

**Responsibilities:**
- Execute single tasks
- No persistent state
- Cheap and disposable
- Used for parallel bursts
- Spawn, complete, disappear

**Commands:**
```bash
gt crew spawn <rig> --task "fix this bug"
gt crew count <rig>    # Count active crew
gt crew purge <rig>    # Kill all crew
```

**Model recommendation:** Haiku (simple, isolated tasks)

---

#### 8. Overseer (Human Boss - YOU)

**Function:** Product Manager and decision maker

**Responsibilities:**
- Define features and priorities
- Review inbox decisions
- Approve major changes
- Provide human judgment
- Has identity in the system with own inbox

**Interface:**
- Human inbox for decisions
- tmux panes for observation
- `gt` CLI for commands
- Can send and receive town mail

> "That's you, Human. As the Overseer, you have an identity in the system, and your own inbox, and you can send and receive town mail."

## 4. Beads: The Memory System

### The "50 First Dates" Problem

> "Agents suffer from '50 First Dates' syndrome - they wake up with no memory of yesterday."

Every new Claude session starts fresh. This is the fundamental problem Beads solves.

### Why Markdown Plans Fail at Scale

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Not queryable | Agents must parse dozens of files to reconstruct work graph |
| No dependency tracking | Agents can't compute which tasks are unblocked |
| Conflict-prone | Multiple agents editing same files |
| Implicit task stacks | "Intelligent wandering" without clear direction |

### What Beads Does

**Beads** (github.com/steveyegge/beads) is a ~225K line Go project providing:

- **Git-backed storage:** All state persisted in git
- **Universal context:** Shared context across all agents
- **Memory management:** Agents can read/write context
- **Hash-based IDs:** (e.g., `bd-a1b2`) prevent merge conflicts
- **Dependency tracking:** Explicit links between tasks
- **Memory decay:** Compaction summarizes old closed tasks

### Why Git as Database?

> "Git as database provides durable, diffable, auditable storage with zero infrastructure."

- **Survives crashes:** Everything is committed
- **Audit trail:** Full history of all agent actions
- **Recovery:** Roll back to any point in time
- **Sharing:** Multiple agents share the same store
- **No heavyweight message bus required**

## 5. The 6 Waves of AI

Steve frames the evolution of AI-assisted development as six overlapping waves:

| Wave | Era | Description | Productivity |
|------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Pre-2022 | Traditional manual coding | Baseline |
| 2 | 2023 | Completions-based (Copilot-style) | ~2x |
| 3 | 2024 | Chat-based (CHOP) | ~5x |
| 4 | 2025 H1 | Coding agents (Claude Code, Amp, Codex) | ~10x |
| 5 | 2025 H2 | Agent clusters (multi-agent parallel) | ~25x |
| **6** | **2026+** | **Agent fleets (AI supervisors managing swarms)** | **~50x+** |

**Gas Town is Wave 6 infrastructure.**

### The 8 Stages of Dev Evolution

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Zero/near-zero AI |
| 2 | Agent in IDE, permissions on |
| 3 | Agent in IDE, YOLO mode |
| 4 | Agent fills screen, code is just diffs |
| 5 | CLI single agent, YOLO |
| 6 | CLI multi-agent (3-5 parallel) |
| 7 | 10+ agents, hand-managed |
| **8** | **Building your own orchestrator** |

**Critical Warning:**
> "If you're not at Stage 7, you'll get your face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees."

Gas Town is for Stage 7+ developers. If you're not there yet, go back to Ralph loops.

---

## 6. Core Principles

### GUPP: The Universal Propulsion Principle

> "If there is work on your hook, YOU MUST RUN IT."

This solves the fundamental problem that "Claude Code ends":

- Work is "slung" to agent hooks (persistent git worktrees)
- When an agent starts, it checks its hook
- If work exists, execution is immediate - no confirmation, no waiting
- Work survives crashes and restarts

**The Gupp Nudge:** Claude Code is "so miserably polite" that GUPP doesn't always work. Gas Town implements a "Gupp Nudge" - agents get a startup poke with `gt nudge` roughly 30-60 seconds after starting.

---

### Zero Framework Cognition

> "Claude makes all decisions. The orchestrator executes."

**Key design principle:** All decisions delegated to AI. No heuristics, regex, or parsing in the orchestrator. The framework provides infrastructure, not intelligence.

---

### Agents as Cattle, Not Pets

This is Kubernetes thinking applied to agents:

- Individual sessions are ephemeral
- The work graph is persistent
- The agent is not the session
- The agent is a Bead (identity with a global address)

---

### Nondeterministic Idempotence

Workflows can be interrupted and resumed at any time:

- Path is fully nondeterministic - different runs take different routes
- Workflow eventually finishes as long as you keep throwing agents at it
- Agents may make mistakes but self-correct because acceptance criteria are well-specified
- The system is resilient to individual component failures

---

### Token Spend as Health Metric

> "Token spend per developer per unit time is the new health metric that best represents how well your company is doing with AI."

**The math:**
- Agent cost: ~$10-12 per operating hour
- Recommended daily developer LLM budget: $100-300
- Yegge's personal spend: ~$300/day, ~$80,000/year
- Gas Town workshops generate 12,000 LOC/day per developer

---

### Talk to the Plan, Not the Agent

Because agents have limited context windows and experience "amnesia":

- Maintain persistent, readable plans in files
- Both you and agents reference these plans
- "Land the Plane" pattern: At session end, clean up git, update issues, spit out prompt for next session

---

## 7. Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites Checklist

Before installing Gas Town, verify:

- [ ] **Go 1.21+** installed (`go version`)
- [ ] **tmux** installed and proficient (`tmux -V`)
- [ ] **Multiple Claude accounts** for parallel agents
- [ ] **Stage 7+ experience** (100+ hours multi-agent)
- [ ] **High chaos tolerance** (some bugs, some lost work)
- [ ] **Budget:** $50-200/day

### Installation

```bash
# Step 1: Install Gas Town
go install github.com/steveyegge/gastown/cmd/gt@latest

# Step 2: Verify installation
gt version

# Step 3: Initialize your town (creates ~/.gt)
gt init
```

**Checkpoint:** You should see `Town initialized at ~/.gt`

### Adding Your First Rig

```bash
# Add a project rig
gt rig add /path/to/your/project

# Verify
gt rig list
```

**Checkpoint:** Your project should appear in the rig list

### Starting the Core Roles

Recommended startup sequence:

```bash
# 1. Start town-level roles first
gt mayor up
gt deacon up
gt dogs up

# 2. Start rig-level infrastructure
gt witness up my-project
gt refinery up my-project

# 3. Start named workers
gt polecat up my-project alice
gt polecat up my-project bob
gt polecat up my-project carol
```

**Checkpoint:** `gt status` should show all roles running

### tmux Workflow

Gas Town is tmux-native. Understand this structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  tmux session: gastown                                       │

│  └──────────────┘  │  └──────────────┘  │  └─────────────┘ │
├────────────────────┴────────────────────┴───────────────────┤
│  Window: overview                                            │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │ rpai - Agent Status Monitor                             ││
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Startup Script

Save this as `gastown-start.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
SESSION="gastown"

# Kill existing session if requested
if [ "$1" = "--fresh" ]; then
  tmux kill-session -t $SESSION 2>/dev/null
fi

# Create session
tmux new-session -d -s $SESSION -n 'overview'

# Infrastructure windows
tmux new-window -t $SESSION -n 'mayor'
tmux new-window -t $SESSION -n 'infra'
tmux split-window -h -t $SESSION:infra

# Per-rig windows
for RIG in project1 project2; do
  tmux new-window -t $SESSION -n "rig-$RIG"
  tmux split-window -h -t "rig-$RIG"
done

# Polecat windows
for POLECAT in alice bob carol; do
  tmux new-window -t $SESSION -n "$POLECAT"
done

# Inbox window
tmux new-window -t $SESSION -n 'inbox'

# Start roles
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:mayor 'gt mayor up' C-m
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:infra.0 'gt deacon up' C-m
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:infra.1 'gt dogs up' C-m
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:rig-project1.0 'gt witness up project1' C-m
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:rig-project1.1 'gt refinery up project1' C-m
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:alice 'gt polecat up project1 alice' C-m
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:bob 'gt polecat up project1 bob' C-m
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:inbox 'watch -n 5 gt inbox' C-m

# Attach
tmux select-window -t $SESSION:overview
tmux attach -t $SESSION
```

### Typical Daily Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Start town
./gastown-start.sh

# Review overnight status
gt status
gt inbox

# File new feature
gt inbox send my-project "Build user authentication"

# Refinery decomposes, assigns to polecats
# You review pending decisions
gt inbox respond 5 --approve
gt inbox respond 7 --approve

# Monitor throughout day (switch tmux windows)
# Dogs run quality checks automatically

# Evening: Review completed work
gt inbox review
gt approve 12 15 18  # Approve completed items

# End of day (polecats persist, crew killed)
gt crew purge my-project
```

---

## 8. Checkpoints and Verification

### Post-Installation Checkpoints

| Step | Command | Expected Output |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Go installed | `go version` | `go version go1.21+` |
| gt installed | `gt version` | Version number |
| Town initialized | `gt status` | Shows town state |
| Rig added | `gt rig list` | Shows your project |
| Mayor running | `gt mayor status` | `running` |

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check all role status
gt status

# Check specific rig
gt rig status my-project

# View agent health
gt deacon report
```

**Healthy state indicators:**
- All roles show `running`
- Deacon reports no anomalies
- Inbox has reasonable pending items (not 100+)
- Polecats are progressing on tasks

### Quality Verification

```bash
# Trigger Dogs quality check
gt dogs bark

# Review what passed/failed
gt dogs report
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Failures and Recovery

#### 1. Context Collapse

**Symptom:** Agents stop making sense, circular reasoning

**Cause:** Beads state corruption or no auto-compact

**Recovery:**
```bash
gt town reset --soft   # Keep config, clear state
gt beads sync --force  # Force context resync
```

---

#### 2. Race Conditions / Merge Conflicts

**Symptom:** Conflicting commits, overwritten work

**Cause:** Multiple Polecats editing same files

**Recovery:**
- Use git worktrees for file isolation
- Implement file ownership rules
- Use the Refinery's merge queue

```bash
# Check for conflicts
git status

# If conflicts exist
gt refinery resolve my-project
```

---

#### 3. Runaway Crew

**Symptom:** Cost spike, dozens of Crew spawned unexpectedly

**Cause:** Refinery misconfiguration or task explosion

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Kill all crew immediately
gt crew purge --all

# Set limits
gt config set crew.max_per_rig 5
gt config set crew.idle_timeout 15
```

---

#### 4. Mayor Deadlock

**Symptom:** No work getting assigned, town seems stuck

**Cause:** Mayor waiting for human decision on something

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Check inbox
gt inbox

# Approve/reject pending items
gt inbox respond <id> --approve
gt inbox respond <id> --reject
```

---

#### 5. Beads Desync

**Symptom:** Agents have stale context, working on old state

**Cause:** Git conflicts in Beads repo

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Force sync
gt beads sync --force

# If that fails, reset Beads
gt beads reset
```

---

#### 6. Agent Won't Start

**Symptom:** `gt polecat up` returns error

**Cause:** Claude account issue, rate limiting, or config problem

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Check config
gt config list

# Try different account
gt config set polecat.alice.account secondary

# Check Claude status
claude --version
```

---

### Recovery Command Reference

```bash
# Soft reset (keep config)
gt town reset --soft

# Hard reset (full reinstall)
gt town reset --hard

# Kill all agents
gt town down

# Restart specific role
gt polecat down my-project alice
gt polecat up my-project alice

# Force Beads sync
gt beads sync --force

# Clear inbox backlog
gt inbox clear --all

# Emergency cost stop
gt pause --all  # Pause all work
gt resume --all # Resume when ready
```

---

## 10. When to Use Gas Town

### Use Gas Town When:

- You're at Stage 7+ (10+ agents, comfortable with chaos)
- Budget is not a concern ($50-200/day)
- You want **team-scale output** as a solo developer
- You have clear product vision but need implementation velocity
- You're comfortable with imperfection (some bugs fixed 2-3 times)
- You have tmux proficiency
- You understand the PM → engineering team mental model

### Don't Use Gas Town When:

- You're below Stage 6 on the dev evolution scale
- Budget is constrained
- You need polish and stability
- You need predictable, controlled outcomes
- You're not comfortable with chaos
- The project is simple enough for Ralph loops
- You haven't mastered Levels 0-6 on the complexity ladder

## 11. Quotes and Key Statements

### On the Core Philosophy

> "Claude Code is the world's biggest fuckin' ant. Everyone is focused on making their ant run longer... when nature prefers colonies."

> "Gas Town is an Idea Compiler. You just make up features, design them, file the implementation plans, and sling work around to your polecats and crew."

> "Work becomes fluid, an uncountable that you sling around freely, like slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels at the docks."

### On Expectations

> "Some bugs fixed 2-3 times. Some fixes get lost. Focus: THROUGHPUT, not perfection."

> "You're not a programmer anymore. You're the head chef of a kitchen with AI robotic sous chefs."

### On Prerequisites

> "If you're not at Stage 7, you'll get your face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees."

> "If you have any doubt whatsoever, then you can't use it."

### On Maturity

> "Code is 3 weeks old - smuggled 400 miles upriver in my ass."

> "100% vibe-coded - I have never looked at the code myself."

### On Cost

> "If you care about costs, don't use this."

> "Expensive as hell - multiple Claude accounts needed."

### On Language Choice

> "Go is just... good. It's boring. You can always understand it!"

> "TypeScript: 1/3 to 1/2 of diffs are type wrestling."

### On Agents

> "That's you, Human. As the Overseer, you have an identity in the system, and your own inbox, and you can send and receive town mail."

> "Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant."

| **Model** | Single agent, retry loop | Multi-agent factory |
| **Complexity** | Bash script | Full system |
| **Persistence** | Via git/progress.txt | Beads data plane |
| **Parallelism** | None (sequential) | Native (many agents) |
| **Roles** | None | 8 specialized roles |
| **Setup** | Minutes | Hours/days |
| **Cost** | Single agent | Multiple accounts |
| **Use Case** | Well-defined features | Complex systems, ongoing dev |

**When to use Ralph:** Single feature, clear completion criteria, budget-conscious

---

### Gas Town vs CC Mirror

| Aspect | CC Mirror | Gas Town |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Model** | Task-based DAG | Agent factory |
| **Complexity** | Medium | High |
| **Setup** | npx command | Go install + config |
| **Dependencies** | TaskCreate/BlockedBy | Beads + Agent Mail |
| **Parallelism** | Auto-scheduled | Explicit workers |
| **Roles** | None (generic agents) | 8 specialized |
| **Persistence** | Built-in tasks | Git via Beads |
| **Cost** | Single variant | Multiple accounts |

**nummanali's take:**
> "Simplicity covers 80% with zero effort - mass-market ease. Gas Town for remaining 20%."

**When to use CC Mirror:** Most projects, getting started with multi-agent
**When to use Gas Town:** Stage 7+ scale, maximum throughput

### Gas Town vs Infinite Orchestra

| Aspect | Orchestra | Gas Town |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Model** | Self-improving | Production factory |
| **Environment** | Docker container | tmux + local |
| **Autonomy** | High (improves itself) | Human-directed |
| **Parallelism** | Sequential (for now) | Native parallel |
| **Roles** | Profiles (coder, arch) | 8 fixed roles |
| **Persistence** | Neo4j optional | Beads |
| **24/7** | Yes (designed for) | Yes (tmux) |

**When to use Orchestra:** Experimental, self-evolving systems
**When to use Gas Town:** Production development, human oversight

## Cost Estimation

```
Role-based cost per hour (estimates):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Mayor (Opus):      $15-20/hour
Refinery (Opus):   $15-20/hour
Dogs (Sonnet):     $5-8/hour
Polecats (Sonnet): $5-10/hour each
Witness (Haiku):   $1-3/hour
Deacon (Haiku):    $1-2/hour
Crew (Haiku):      $0.50-2/hour each

Example daily cost:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1 Mayor + 1 Deacon + 1 Dogs + 2 Rigs + 3 Polecats + 5 Crew
= $18 + $1.5 + $7 + $40 + $22.5 + $5
= ~$94/hour (rough estimate)

8 hours = ~$752/day (heavy usage)
Conservative usage = $50-100/day
```

## YOUR OBSERVATIONS

Write about what you experience. Use this structure, but write in your own voice. Be specific — name files, name moments, name CSS decisions. The next builder reads your observations and must know EXACTLY what you mean.

### 1. DEEPLY INTEGRATED

Material from the corpus that has genuinely shaped the artifact. Not surface references — structural influence. Where you can FEEL that the builder read the file deeply and it changed how they built.

The 48px test: If you removed all the CSS the builder added and started from scratch, would they NEED to have read these files to build what they built? If the answer is "no, any builder could have done this without reading the corpus," the integration is surface-level.

Name the specific corpus file. Quote or paraphrase the specific passage. Point to the specific CSS decision or HTML structure that shows deep integration.

### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL

Material that appears referenced but not structurally woven in. The builder seems aware of it — maybe a mechanism name appears in a class name, maybe a spacing value matches a number from the research. But the reference does not go deeper than acknowledgment.

This is not failure. It is diagnosis — the next builder can deepen these connections.

### 3. ABSENT

Material from the corpus that has no visible influence on the artifact. This is not always a problem — some corpus material may genuinely not apply to this content. But if the builder received a file about density progression and the page has uniform density throughout, that absence matters.

Distinguish between "absent because irrelevant to this content" and "absent despite being relevant."

### 4. SURPRISED

Unexpected connections or tensions between the corpus material and the artifact. Places where the builder found something in the material that you would not have predicted. Or places where the material suggests a direction the artifact contradicts.

Surprises are the most valuable observation. They indicate either creative breakthrough (good) or creative misreading (correctable).

### 5. WHAT THE NEXT BUILDER SHOULD ATTEND TO

The 2-3 highest-leverage integration opportunities. Frame these as creative invitations, not defect reports.

Good: "The research on component choreography describes how velocity changes create anticipation — the artifact's components currently have uniform pacing. What if the callouts in zone 3 tightened their spacing while zone 5 opened up?"

Bad: "Components lack velocity variation."

Each invitation should name the corpus file, the specific concept, and a concrete creative direction the next builder could explore.

Do NOT write CSS. Do NOT suggest specific values. Do NOT use CSS terminology. Write about what you EXPERIENCE — using words like heavy, breathing, flat, alive, monotonous, surprising, confident, hesitant, warm, sharp, crowded, spacious, earned, forced.

You are a reader, not a programmer. What do you feel?

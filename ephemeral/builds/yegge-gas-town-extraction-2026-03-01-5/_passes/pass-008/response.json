DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**The refinery cross-section metaphor is load-bearing, not decorative.** The creative direction described seven strata — foundation, conversion, operations, infrastructure, principles, surface, dispatch — and this page builds them as literal geological bands. Each stratum has its own background warmth (darker toward bedrock and dispatch, lighter in the middle), and the content within each band genuinely corresponds to its described emotional register. The foundation stratum PLACES you (complexity ladder, bouncer's checklist). The conversion stratum DESTABILIZES you (the paradigm-crack quote gets maximum typographic weight, maximum breathing room, and the only red left-border in that zone). The operations stratum IS the density peak — I can feel it pushing against the viewport with 8 role cards, a hierarchy diagram, and a communication flow. The creative direction said \"a precisely engineered control room inside a post-apocalyptic refinery — every instrument exact, every surface showing wear.\" The page delivers this. The instruments (role cards with model badges, the memory model with border-weight-encoded retrieval priority, the cost estimation with line items) are exact. The wear shows in the content itself — \"some bugs fixed 2-3 times,\" \"smuggled 400 miles upriver in my ass\" — and the page doesn't flinch from hosting that language inside its precise geometry.\n\n**R5-COMBINATION-THEORY's sequencing principles are structural, not referenced.** The 2-callout limit (R5 anti-pattern A1) is never violated across the entire page. More importantly, the velocity variation principle (R5 T2) genuinely governs the operations stratum — after the three town-level role cards (SLOW, dense, structured scan), a section divider provides breathing room before the rig-level cards. The Overseer card sits alone after another divider, isolated by whitespace, which makes the reader's identification with that role feel earned rather than declared. The communication flow diagram AFTER the role deep dives resolves the roles into motion (R5 principle S1: setup-payoff arc). The closing sequence of Gotcha (\"merge queue is sequential\") followed by Challenge (\"trace a real feature through the flow\") follows R5's anti-pattern A7 prevention — never end on anxiety, always offer action.\n\n**R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS' geological model maps directly to the memory model component.** The three-layer memory visualization (hot/warm/cold) uses border-weight gradient (4px red for hot, 3px amber for warm, 1px gray for cold) to encode retrieval urgency. This isn't just mechanism #1 from DD-006 reused generically — it's the geological model from R3 section 2.1 (\"surface layer, sediment layer, bedrock layer\") applied to a content element that IS about geological layering of data. The research described \"information stratified like rock layers.\" The builder found a content element where the metaphor and the subject matter are the same thing.\n\n**DD-006-fractal's divergence assignment was honored.** The builder extracted mechanisms (border-weight gradient, zone background differentiation, spacing compression, 2-zone component DNA, typographic scale jumping) while rejecting the fractal metaphor itself. The page does NOT use self-similar rhythm at all scales — it uses GEOLOGICAL PROGRESSION, where each stratum is genuinely different from the others. The bedrock is dense and qualifying, the conversion is sparse and seismic, the operations floor is the heaviest, and the dispatch lightens toward closure. This is the correct creative response to DD-006's explicit warning: \"pattern-matching to this output defeats the purpose of tension-derived composition.\"\n\n**The creative direction's opposition — chaos against architecture — is held without resolution.** The page feels like an engineering manual that acknowledges its own machines are partially feral. The role hierarchy diagram has clean boxes and clean arrows, but the content inside those boxes describes entities that \"drift,\" get \"unstuck,\" experience \"50 First Dates syndrome,\" and need to be \"purged.\" The critical warning (\"face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees\") sits inside a precisely bordered alarm component. The Gotcha callout about the merge queue reveals that parallel execution requires serial integration — the architecture IS the chaos management. This dual truth is structural, not rhetorical.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**R3's six density dimensions are acknowledged in CSS comments but not independently manipulated.** The comments reference \"temporal density,\" \"cognitive density,\" \"interaction density,\" and \"semantic density\" by name, but the page only varies spatial density (component count per viewport) and temporal density (scroll-based information reveal) in practice. Cognitive density — the mental processing required per unit area — is not independently controlled. The operations stratum is cognitively dense AND spatially dense simultaneously, but R3 insight 15 suggests that areas with many interactive choices need visual sparsity to offset cognitive load. The role cards are not interactive, so this may be moot, but the principle of independent manipulation across dimensions remains more cited than enacted.\n\n**R5's component moods and voices framework appears in the CSS comments (\"temperature = warm,\" \"velocity = SLOW\") but the components themselves don't vary typographically by mood.** All callout bodies use the same font-size and line-height regardless of whether they are Info (helpful), Gotcha (urgent), or Challenge (inviting). The Essence callout switches to Instrument Serif italic, which IS mood differentiation. But the other four callout types are visually identical except for border color and background shade. R5 Framework R2 describes distinct emotional valences per component; here the differentiation is color-only.\n\n**The RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS conflict resolution on \"progressive disclosure vs flat design\" (Conflict 2) is noted but barely exercised.** The synthesis recommended \"expandable/collapsible sections (flat toggles, not 3D buttons)\" and \"scroll-based reveals.\" The page has no collapsible elements, no progressive disclosure, no expand/contract interactions. Everything is laid out flat, which is honest to the KortAI soul's flatness constraint — but the synthesis specifically resolved this conflict by saying progressive disclosure COULD happen through click-to-expand. The page chose full revelation instead. This may be a deliberate decision for a reference document (where everything should be findable), but it means one of the synthesis's conflict resolutions went unused.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**R3's temporal density patterns (PULSE, CRESCENDO, BOOKENDS, WAVE) are named in comments but the page follows a single arc: CRESCENDO through operations, then gradual DESCENT.** The PULSE pattern — HIGH→LOW→HIGH→LOW cycles — would require repeated density peaks within the dispatch stratum, which doesn't happen. The dispatch stratum is a long, gradual descent from comparison tables through quotes through sources to metadata. R3 insight 3 describes PULSE as best for \"tutorials, learning journeys,\" and the surface stratum (Implementation Guide) IS a tutorial — but it too follows a monotone density rather than oscillating. The daily workflow section could have used tighter/looser alternation (the three phases — morning, midday, evening — are identically spaced).\n\n**R5's Quantitative Guidelines (Q1, Q2, Q3) about component density limits are invisible.** For a page this long (well over 1500 words), R5 Q1 recommends 4-5 heavy components, 8-10 callouts, and 6-8 code snippets maximum. The page has far more than 8-10 callouts and far more than 6-8 code snippets. The quantitative guidelines were not designed for a document of this length and density, and strictly applying them would have gutted the content — so their absence is understandable. Bu",

The artifact is a 230KB industrial cross-section where the geological stratum metaphor genuinely load-bears — seven background warmths encode informational weight, border-weight gradients serve both role hierarchy and memory-layer urgency, R5's sequencing principles govern callout limits and velocity transitions structurally rather than by citation — but every container is immaculate, every border pristine, every grid perfectly aligned, producing a refinery that has never been used hard despite hosting content ("smuggled 400 miles upriver in my ass," "face ripped off by superintelligent chimpanzees") that snarls against its own framing. Across three verification checkpoints the integration trajectory deepened from structural metaphor through genuine mechanism extraction to held creative opposition between chaos and architecture, with builders increasingly discovering organic density variation within repeating structures (the failure blocks' naturally varying recovery sections, the role cards' tier-based grid shifts), but the page is growing toward exhaustive flat revelation — no progressive disclosure, no interactive density, no temporal rhythm patterns — meaning its dominant creative momentum is toward completeness rather than shaped experience. The richest unclaimed territory is the felt texture of use — builders have wanted "wear" across multiple passes without finding it within soul constraints, and the answer likely lives not in surface distressing but in R3's temporal density patterns (PULSE and WAVE) applied to sequences that currently march at uniform spacing: the eight role cards, the six failure blocks, the three daily workflow phases, and the operations-to-infrastructure transition where the page's density peak creates unrecovered debt, all places where deliberate breathing-in-and-out would make the facility feel operated rather than displayed.

## World-Description

This page lives in the part of the KortAI world where the geometry gets industrial. Where the sharp edges stop being aesthetic and start being structural — load-bearing walls in a factory that builds other factories. The earth tones here are closer to rust and engine grease than cream and paper. The single red appears not as accent but as alarm: the content itself warns you away unless you belong here.

## Opposition

The central tension is **chaos against architecture**. Every sentence in this document serves two masters simultaneously.

On one side: a system so precisely hierarchical it has 8 named roles, explicit communication flows, model-tier recommendations per role, and startup sequences that read like launch checklists. GUPP is a protocol. The merge queue is sequential. Quality gates exist. The architecture diagram has clean boxes and clean arrows.

On the other side: "some bugs fixed 2-3 times." "Some fixes get lost." "Code is 3 weeks old — smuggled 400 miles upriver in my ass." "100% vibe-coded — I have never looked at the code myself." Nondeterministic idempotence. Comfort with chaos as a literal prerequisite.

The page must hold both truths without resolving them. The architecture IS the chaos management. The chaos IS the productive engine. A page that looks too clean betrays the content. A page that looks too wild betrays the engineering. The builder must construct something that feels like a precisely engineered control room inside a post-apocalyptic refinery — every instrument exact, every surface showing wear.

## Metaphor

The structural metaphor is the **refinery cross-section** — a vertical slice through an industrial facility, viewed from the side, showing stacked operational levels from foundation to output.

This is not decorative. It emerges from the content's own architecture: the document literally moves from bedrock (prerequisites, "you are here" on the complexity ladder) up through the paradigm shift (the mental model), through the factory floor (8 roles), through the infrastructure systems (Beads memory), through the operating principles (GUPP, zero framework cognition), to the surface level (daily workflow, troubleshooting), and finally the dispatch office (when to use, comparisons with alternatives).

The cross-section organizes the page into visible strata:

- **Foundation stratum**: Who this is for, where they stand, what they need. Dense with qualification. The bedrock that everything rests on.
- **Conversion stratum**: The paradigm shift. Ant → colony. Programmer → PM. This is where the ground transforms — the narrowest layer but the most seismically important.
- **Operations stratum**: The 8 roles. The widest, densest layer. The factory floor itself. This is where the page earns its authority — showing the full machine.
- **Infrastructure stratum**: Beads, the memory system. Runs beneath the operations floor like plumbing and wiring. Essential but subordinate.
- **Principles stratum**: The operating rules. GUPP, cattle-not-pets, nondeterministic idempotence. The physics of this particular factory.
- **Surface stratum**: Installation, daily workflow, troubleshooting. Where the reader's hands meet the machine.
- **Dispatch stratum**: Decision guidance, comparisons. The loading dock — should this cargo even be here?

## Arc

**Opening (Foundation):** The reader should feel *located*. Not welcomed — placed. A firm hand on the shoulder pointing at a map that says "you are here, and here is high." The complexity ladder is a vertical truth: you earned your way to this altitude. The prerequisites feel like a bouncer's checklist — not hostile, but serious. The emotion is **respect earned, not given**.

**First turn (Conversion):** A door opens. The core insight — "nature prefers colonies" — should land like a paradigm crack. The reader's mental model of what they've been doing (making the ant run longer) should suddenly feel small. Not wrong — small. The emotion shifts from located to **destabilized**. The comparison diagrams (traditional vs. Gas Town) should feel like seeing a new dimension.

**Ascent (Operations):** The 8 roles unfold and the reader should feel **awe at machinery**. Not intimidation — the awe of watching a complex system that makes sense. Each role is a new chamber in the factory revealed. The hierarchy diagram is the peak density moment — the most information per viewport in the entire page. The deep dives are pressure-relief valves between peaks.

**Deepening (Infrastructure + Principles):** After the operational peak, the reader descends into systems. Beads should feel like **discovering the hidden plumbing** — "oh, THAT's how they share memory." The principles (GUPP, cattle-not-pets) should feel like **laws of physics being named** — not invented, recognized. The 6 waves table provides temporal context: you're not just learning a tool, you're standing at a point in evolution.

**Surface (Implementation):** Relief. **Grounding**. After the conceptual density, the reader's hands find concrete surfaces: `go install`, `gt init`, tmux layouts, startup scripts. The emotion is "I could actually do this." The daily workflow section should feel like watching someone's morning routine — intimate, practical, demystifying.

**Closure (Decision):** Honest self-assessment. The "when NOT to use" section should feel **generous, not defensive** — like a master craftsman saying "this tool isn't for every job." The comparison matrices provide the final calibration: where Gas Town sits in the ecosystem. The reader leaves feeling oriented, not sold.

## Content Map

**Foundation stratum** maps to: "You Are Here" + "Who is Steve Yegge?"
- The complexity ladder diagram is the page's first structural landmark — vertical, sharp, immediately orienting.
- Yegge's bio establishes credibility through career facts, not rhetoric. The table format serves this: compact authority.
- Density: MEDIUM. Enough to establish stakes, not so much it delays the core insight.

**Conversion stratum** maps to: "The Gas Town Mental Model"
- The "biggest fuckin' ant" quote is the hinge moment. It must land with typographic weight — Instrument Serif, generous whitespace.
- The Traditional vs. Gas Town comparison is the content's most important diagram. Two columns, stark contrast.
- The "Idea Compiler" concept deserves its own breathing moment.
- Density: LOW spatially, HIGH semantically. Few elements, each carrying maximum meaning.

**Operations stratum** maps to: "The 8 Roles Architecture"
- The hierarchy overview diagram is the page's density peak. The full system visible at once.
- The 8 role deep-dives need rhythm: each role gets consistent structure (function, responsibilities, commands, model recommendation) but the page must not feel like 8 identical cards. Vary the density between roles.
- The communication flow diagram resolves the roles into action — it shows the machine running, not just sitting.
- Density: HIGH, with deliberate breathing moments between role clusters (town-level roles, rig-level roles, human level).

**Infrastructure stratum** maps to: "Beads: The Memory System"
- Opens with the "50 First Dates" problem — immediately relatable, emotionally grounding after the architectural density.
- The memory model layers (hot/warm/cold) are a natural teaching progression.
- "Why Git as Database?" is a principle worth isolating.
- Density: MEDIUM-HIGH, but more narrative than the roles section.

**Principles stratum** maps to: "The 6 Waves of AI" + "Core Principles"
- The 6 waves table provides historical sweep — the reader sees where they sit in time.
- GUPP, zero framework cognition, cattle-not-pets, nondeterministic idempotence: each deserves distinct treatment. These are laws, not tips.
- Density: MEDIUM. Conceptual weight is high but spatial density should be moderate.

**Surface stratum** maps to: "Implem

## 3. Cross-Reference: pa-deployment.md vs MANIFEST.md

### 3.1 Exact Match Verification

| Auditor | pa-deployment.md questions | MANIFEST.md questions | MATCH? |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| A | PA-01, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05, PA-45, PA-65, PA-67, PA-72, PA-76 (9) | PA-01, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05, PA-45, PA-65, PA-67, PA-72, PA-76 (9) | EXACT MATCH |
| B | PA-02, PA-08, PA-29, PA-55, PA-56, PA-70, PA-77, PA-81 (8) | PA-02, PA-08, PA-29, PA-55, PA-56, PA-70, PA-77, PA-81 (8) | EXACT MATCH |
| C | PA-11, PA-30, PA-31, PA-32, PA-33, PA-50, PA-51, PA-53, PA-64, PA-66 (10) | PA-11, PA-30-33, PA-50, PA-51, PA-53, PA-64, PA-66 (10) | EXACT MATCH (range notation "PA-30-33" = PA-30, PA-31, PA-32, PA-33) |
| D | PA-12, PA-13, PA-34, PA-35, PA-36, PA-52, PA-62, PA-69, PA-71, PA-74, PA-75 (11) | PA-12, PA-13, PA-34-36, PA-52, PA-62, PA-69, PA-71, PA-74, PA-75 (11) | EXACT MATCH (range notation "PA-34-36" = PA-34, PA-35, PA-36) |
| E | PA-14, PA-15, PA-37, PA-38, PA-39, PA-63, PA-80 (7) | PA-14, PA-15, PA-37-39, PA-63, PA-80 (7) | EXACT MATCH (range notation "PA-37-39" = PA-37, PA-38, PA-39) |
| F | PA-16, PA-17, PA-41, PA-60, PA-61 (5) | PA-16, PA-17, PA-41, PA-60, PA-61 (5) | EXACT MATCH |
| G | PA-18, PA-19, PA-20, PA-42, PA-43, PA-44, PA-54, PA-68 (8) | PA-18-20, PA-42-44, PA-54, PA-68 (8) | EXACT MATCH (range notation) |
| H | PA-22, PA-23, PA-46, PA-47, PA-73 (5) | PA-22, PA-23, PA-46, PA-47, PA-73 (5) | EXACT MATCH |
| I | PA-24, PA-25, PA-26, PA-27, PA-28, PA-48 (6) | PA-24-28, PA-48 (6) | EXACT MATCH (range notation "PA-24-28" = PA-24, PA-25, PA-26, PA-27, PA-28) |

### 3.2 Notation Discrepancy (NON-BLOCKING)

MANIFEST.md uses hyphenated range shorthand (e.g., "PA-30-33", "PA-18-20") while pa-deployment.md lists each ID explicitly. The ranges expand to identical sets. However, this notation is **AMBIGUOUS** — "PA-30-33" could theoretically be parsed as a single question ID "PA-30-33" rather than the range "PA-30, PA-31, PA-32, PA-33".

**Finding NOTATION-01:** MANIFEST.md should either use explicit comma-separated IDs (matching pa-deployment.md) or add a parenthetical note like "PA-30 through PA-33" to eliminate ambiguity. This is especially important because the PA question ID space has gaps (there are no PA-06, PA-07, PA-09, PA-10, PA-21, PA-40, PA-49, PA-57-59, PA-78-79).

**Severity: LOW.** The parenthetical counts match (e.g., "(10 questions)" for C), which disambiguates in context.

### 3.3 Verdict

**ALL 9 auditor assignments match EXACTLY between pa-deployment.md and MANIFEST.md.**

## 4. Sum Verification: Duplicates and Orphans

### 4.1 Union of All Assigned Questions

Complete assigned set (9 auditors combined, 69 unique IDs):

```
A: PA-01, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05, PA-45, PA-65, PA-67, PA-72, PA-76
B: PA-02, PA-08, PA-29, PA-55, PA-56, PA-70, PA-77, PA-81
C: PA-11, PA-30, PA-31, PA-32, PA-33, PA-50, PA-51, PA-53, PA-64, PA-66
D: PA-12, PA-13, PA-34, PA-35, PA-36, PA-52, PA-62, PA-69, PA-71, PA-74, PA-75
E: PA-14, PA-15, PA-37, PA-38, PA-39, PA-63, PA-80
F: PA-16, PA-17, PA-41, PA-60, PA-61
G: PA-18, PA-19, PA-20, PA-42, PA-43, PA-44, PA-54, PA-68
H: PA-22, PA-23, PA-46, PA-47, PA-73
I: PA-24, PA-25, PA-26, PA-27, PA-28, PA-48
```

### 4.2 Duplicate Check

Every question ID appears in exactly ONE auditor's assignment. **Zero duplicates found.**

### 4.3 Orphan Check

All 69 question IDs defined in pa-questions.md are present in the combined auditor assignments. **Zero orphans found.**

### 4.4 Phantom Check (IDs in assignments not defined in questions)

All IDs in auditor assignments have corresponding definitions in pa-questions.md. **Zero phantoms found.**

### 4.5 Retired Questions Verification

pa-deployment.md Section 1.2 footnote confirms 3 questions were retired (Wave 3 changes ME-037):
- PA-06 — retired from B (near-zero failure rate)
- PA-09 — retired from C (subsumed by PA-33)
- PA-40 — retired from F (subsumed by PA-69)

These 3 retired IDs do NOT appear in any assignment or definition. **Consistent.**

3 questions were added as replacements:
- PA-81 added to B (information extraction)
- PA-80 added to E (navigation usability)
- PA-54 added to G (content promise vs delivery)

**Net zero: 69 questions maintained.** Confirmed.

### 4.6 Sum

9 + 8 + 10 + 11 + 7 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 6 = **69**. PASS.

## 5. Theme-to-Auditor Fit Analysis

### 5.1 Auditor A — Impression + Emotion (9 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-01 | First impression / what bothers you | PERFECT — first impression is A's core |
| PA-03 | Coherence / one designer or three | GOOD — overall gestalt impression |
| PA-04 | Eye flow / where does your eye go | GOOD — primary visual impression |
| PA-05 | Ship quality / 4 sub-criteria | PERFECT — A owns the primary metric |
| PA-45 | Excellence / single design moment | GOOD — subjective quality judgment |
| PA-65 | Music analogy / ensemble vs unison | GOOD — emotional/impressionistic question |
| PA-67 | Novelty / unpredicted visual element | GOOD — surprise = emotional response |
| PA-72 | Content specificity / design for THIS content | GOOD — impression of content-form resonance |
| PA-76 | Journey shape / builds, peaks, resolves | GOOD — emotional arc is A's domain |

**Verdict: EXCELLENT FIT (9/9 well-placed).**

### 5.2 Auditor B — Readability + Typography (8 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-02 | Uncomfortable text | PERFECT — readability is B's core |
| PA-08 | Squinting / lean in to read | PERFECT — readability |
| PA-29 | Header text style count | GOOD — typography analysis |
| PA-55 | Sub-perceptual / section differences | ACCEPTABLE — descriptive/comparative, but sub-perceptual detection is more spatial than typographic |
| PA-56 | Sub-perceptual / tracking difference | GOOD — letter-spacing is typography |
| PA-70 | Dense vs light treatment | ACCEPTABLE — moved from D per FIX, density-typography connection valid |
| PA-77 | Text hierarchy / 3+ importance levels | PERFECT — typography hierarchy |
| PA-81 | Chart/diagram information extraction | ACCEPTABLE — readability of data viz; slight stretch since B is "readability" not "information design" |

**Verdict: GOOD FIT (5 perfect/good, 3 acceptable). PA-55 (sub-perceptual section differences) is a mild misfit — it asks about visual differentiation between sections which is closer to C's spatial domain. However, the original rationale (FIX-061: "descriptive question suits B's role") is defensible.**

### 5.3 Auditor C — Spatial + Proportion (10 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-11 | Margin quality | PERFECT — spatial |
| PA-30 | Designed for width | PERFECT — proportion |
| PA-31 | Space feels designed | PERFECT — spatial quality |
| PA-32 | Visual weight distribution | PERFECT — spatial balance |
| PA-33 | Negative space quality | PERFECT — spatial |
| PA-50 | Viewport content count | PERFECT — void prevention = spatial |
| PA-51 | Content density impression | PERFECT — spatial density |
| PA-53 | Container width utilization | PERFECT — proportion |
| PA-64 | Restraint / deliberately plain section | GOOD — restraint has spatial dimension |
| PA-66 | Negative space variety | PERFECT — directly spatial |

**Verdict: EXCELLENT FIT (9 perfect, 1 good). C has the highest load (10 questions) but all are tightly thematic.**

**Load concern: C at 10 questions is the second-highest loaded auditor.** pa-deployment.md notes FIX-064 (C1/C2 split) is DEFERRED CONTINGENT. This is the right call — 10 is manageable for a focused domain.

### 5.4 Auditor D — Flow + Pacing (11 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-12 | Section flow smoothness | PERFECT — flow is D's core |
| PA-13 | Visual ending | PERFECT — pacing/closure |
| PA-34 | Transition moment design | PERFECT — flow transitions |
| PA-35 | Interest curve / skimming | PERFECT — pacing |
| PA-36 | Dramatic visual moment | PERFECT — pacing peaks |
| PA-52 | Designed moment per third | GOOD — moved from C per FIX, aligns with D's PA-35 |
| PA-62 | Transition variation / dramatic vs quiet | PERFECT — Tier 5 transition depth |
| PA-69 | Property count at transitions | PERFECT — transition analysis |
| PA-71 | Boundary quality / handoff vs collision | PERFECT — flow at boundaries |
| PA-74 | Boundary coherence / changes agree | PERFECT — transition coherence |
| PA-75 | Ending quality / designed conclusion | PERFECT — pacing/closure |

**Verdict: EXCELLENT FIT (10 perfect, 1 good). D has the HIGHEST load (11 questions).**

**Load concern: D at 11 questions is the most heavily loaded auditor. This is 2.2x the load of F and H (5 each).** However, all 11 are tightly thematic (flow/pacing/transitions/endings) and many are observational rather than analytical (e.g., PA-12 "do eyes flow smoothly" is a quick assessment). The load is acceptable given domain coherence.

### 5.5 Auditor E — Grid + Layout (7 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-14 | Column breathing room | PERFECT — grid |
| PA-15 | Left edge alignment | PERFECT — layout geometry |
| PA-37 | Information density / control panel | GOOD — layout/density |
| PA-38 | Card reading order | PERFECT — layout |
| PA-39 | Header ratio | GOOD — layout proportions |
| PA-63 | Fractal zoom coherence | ACCEPTABLE — fractal design echoes. This is a compositional question that touches layout but is really about design language coherence. Could fit in A (impression) or G (metaphor) equally well. |
| PA-80 | Navigation usability | ACCEPTABLE — navigation is structural/layout, but "usability" is different from grid assessment. |

**Verdict: GOOD FIT (4 perfect, 2 good, 2 acceptable). PA-63 is the weakest fit — fractal coherence is about design language echoing at multiple scales, which is a compositional/impression question more than a grid question.**

### 5.6 Auditor F — Consistency + Rhythm (5 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-16 | Identical element comparison | PERFECT — consistency |
| PA-17 | Visual rhythm / beat (TIER 1 EQUIV) | PERFECT — rhythm is F's core |
| PA-41 | 4+ repetitions / monotony (TIER 1 EQUIV) | PERFECT — rhythm/repetition |
| PA-60 | Design moment density | GOOD — moments relate to rhythm variation |
| PA-61 | Multi-voice composition | GOOD — independent rhythms is rhythm domain |

**Verdict: EXCELLENT FIT (3 perfect, 2 good). Lightest load (5 questions) but includes 2 TIER 1 EQUIVALENT questions that carry outsized weight.**

### 5.7 Auditor G — Metaphor + Ideology (8 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-18 | Gray/neutral family | ACCEPTABLE — color consistency, but "ideology" stretch |
| PA-19 | Element from different website | GOOD — visual coherence/identity |
| PA-20 | Visual-content personality match | PERFECT — ideology |
| PA-42 | Metaphor wrong despite understanding | PERFECT — metaphor |
| PA-43 | Metaphor visual cost | PERFECT — metaphor |
| PA-44 | Metaphor without labels | PERFECT — metaphor |
| PA-54 | Structural promise / nav fulfillment | ACCEPTABLE — this is structural/navigation, not metaphor |
| PA-68 | Metaphor spatial coverage | PERFECT — metaphor persistence |

**Verdict: GOOD FIT (5 perfect, 1 good, 2 acceptable). PA-18 (color family) and PA-54 (structural promise) are the weakest fits. PA-18 was inherited from the original "Color and Emotion" grouping which maps to G's broader "Ideology" domain. PA-54 is about whether navigational promises are kept — this is structural integrity, not metaphor.**

**Specific concern: PA-54** asks about TOC entries/section numbers/tabs that "promise content" and whether those promises are fulfilled. This is closer to E's Grid + Layout domain or even I's Architectural Challenge domain. Its assignment to G appears to be an artifact of Wave 3's addition (ME-037) rather than optimal thematic fit.

### 5.8 Auditor H — Responsiveness (5 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-22 | Screen size / served or punished | PERFECT — responsive |
| PA-23 | 1024 vs 768 comparison | PERFECT — responsive |
| PA-46 | 768px reorganization | PERFECT — responsive |
| PA-47 | Scroll position / surprise in second half | MARGINAL — this is a pacing question, not responsive. "At what scroll position do you feel 'seen this before'?" is about content pacing, not viewport adaptation. |
| PA-73 | Accessibility / keyboard/screen reader | ACCEPTABLE — accessibility often pairs with responsive in practice, though conceptually distinct |

**Verdict: GOOD FIT (3 perfect, 1 acceptable, 1 marginal). PA-47 is the most misplaced question in the entire routing.** It asks about scroll fatigue and surprise in the second half — this is squarely D's Flow + Pacing domain. Its placement in H appears historical (it was originally grouped with responsive questions) but it does not require multiple viewport comparisons, which is what makes H's domain unique.

**Finding MISFIT-01 (LOW): PA-47 should be in Auditor D (Flow + Pacing), not H (Responsiveness).** However, D already has 11 questions (highest load), so moving PA-47 would increase D to 12 and reduce H to 4. The load balancing tradeoff may justify keeping it in H. Not a routing error — a thematic suboptimality.

### 5.9 Auditor I — Cross-Page + Adversarial (6 questions)

| ID | Theme | Fit? |
|----|-------|------|
| PA-24 | Design system membership | PERFECT — cross-page |
| PA-25 | Identity persistence | PERFECT — cross-page |
| PA-26 | Wrong-but-intentional | PERFECT — architectural challenge |
| PA-27 | Would you design this way | PERFECT — architectural critique |
| PA-28 | Fragility / 3 damaging changes | PERFECT — adversarial |
| PA-48 | Ranking among five options | GOOD — adversarial/evaluative |

**Verdict: EXCELLENT FIT (5 perfect, 1 good). Tightest thematic coherence of any auditor.**

### 5.10 Theme-Fit Summary

| Auditor | Load | Perfect | Good | Acceptable | Marginal | Verdict |
|---------|------|---------|------|------------|----------|---------|
| A | 9 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | EXCELLENT |
| B | 8 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 0 | GOOD |
| C | 10 | 9 | 1 | 0 | 0 | EXCELLENT |
| D | 11 | 10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | EXCELLENT |
| E | 7 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 0 | GOOD |
| F | 5 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | EXCELLENT |
| G | 8 | 5 | 1 | 2 | 0 | GOOD |
| H | 5 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | GOOD |
| I | 6 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 0 | EXCELLENT |

**Overall: 5 EXCELLENT, 4 GOOD. No POOR fits. 1 MARGINAL placement (PA-47 in H instead of D).**

## 6. Mini-PA (Mode 2.5) Analysis

### 6.1 Mini-PA Assignments (from pa-deployment.md Section 6.2)

| Auditor | Role | Questions | Count |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| A | Impression + Emotion | PA-01, PA-03, PA-05, PA-45, PA-65 | 5 |
| C | Spatial + Proportion | PA-11, PA-30, PA-31, PA-50, PA-66 | 5 |
| G | Metaphor + Ideology | PA-18, PA-19, PA-42, PA-54, PA-68 | 5 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **15** |

### 6.2 Discrepancy: Mini-PA vs Full Mode Assignments

Mini-PA auditor A loses PA-04, PA-67, PA-72, PA-76 from full mode (keeps 5 of 9).
Mini-PA auditor C loses PA-32, PA-33, PA-51, PA-53, PA-64 from full mode (keeps 5 of 10).
Mini-PA auditor G loses PA-20, PA-43, PA-44 from full mode (keeps 5 of 8).

**Question selection appears intentional — highest-priority questions retained, lower-priority trimmed.**

### 6.3 Coverage of Critical Dimensions

| Dimension | Covered in Mini-PA? | By which question? |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| PA-05 (primary metric) | YES | PA-05 via A |
| First impression | YES | PA-01 via A |
| Void detection | YES | PA-50 via C |
| Spatial proportion | YES | PA-30, PA-31 via C |
| Metaphor visibility | YES | PA-42, PA-68 via G |
| Excellence moment | YES | PA-45 via A |
| Margin quality | YES | PA-11 via C |

| Structural promise | YES | PA-54 via G |
| Coherence / one designer | YES | PA-03 via A |

### 6.4 What's Missing from Mini-PA

**Fully absent auditor domains:**

| Excluded Auditor | Domain | Impact |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| B (Readability) | Readability, typography, text comfort, sub-perceptual detection | **HIGH** — illegible text is the #1 BLOCKING defect type per pipeline history |
| D (Flow + Pacing) | Transitions, endings, visual journey, interest curve | MEDIUM — structural pacing unlikely to change in IMPROVE pass |
| E (Grid + Layout) | Grid, columns, reading order, navigation | MEDIUM — grid is structural |
| F (Consistency + Rhythm) | Repetition, rhythm, monotony | MEDIUM — includes 2 TIER 1 EQUIVALENT questions (PA-17, PA-41) |
| H (Responsiveness) | Responsive, accessibility | LOW — IMPROVE shouldn't change HTML structure |
| I (Cross-Page + Adversarial) | Design system coherence, adversarial analysis | LOW — adversarial is discovery-oriented |

**Finding MINI-01 (MEDIUM): Mini-PA excludes Auditor B (Readability), which catches the single most important class of BLOCKING defects — illegible text.** The experiential pass partly compensates (all 3 Mini-PA auditors do the experiential pass which includes reading every word from pixels), but B's focused typography and sub-perceptual detection questions (PA-55, PA-56, PA-77) are absent.

**Finding MINI-02 (MEDIUM): Mini-PA excludes both TIER 1 EQUIVALENT questions (PA-17 from F, PA-41 from F).** pa-questions.md explicitly states: "FAIL on either = verdict cannot exceed 'YES WITH RESERVATIONS.'" The Mini-PA can issue a SHIP verdict without checking these ceiling-limiting questions.

**Finding MINI-03 (LOW): Mini-PA includes only 3 of 9 Tier 5 questions (PA-65 from A, PA-66 from C, PA-68 from G).** pa-deployment.md Section 6.4 correctly documents this: "Tier 5: Score from available questions (3 of 9 Tier 5 Qs assessable)." The limitation is acknowledged.

### 6.5 Mini-PA Verdict

The Mini-PA selection is **well-designed for its stated purpose** (IMPROVE validation when PA-05 >= 3.0). The 15 questions cover the most critical dimensions. The exclusions are justified by the rationale in pa-deployment.md Section 6.5.

**The two concerns are:**
1. Readability exclusion (MINI-01) — partially mitigated by experiential pass
2. TIER 1 EQUIVALENT exclusion (MINI-02) — a gap in the verdict ceiling logic

## 7. Redundancy and Overlap Analysis

### 7.1 Questions with Significant Overlap

**Cluster 1: Negative Space / Void / Breathing (5 questions)**
- PA-31 (C): "If you covered the content and only looked at the surrounding space, would it feel designed or leftover?"
- PA-33 (C): "Pick the largest area of empty space. Does it feel like silence in music or a dropped signal?"
- PA-50 (C): "Count viewport-heights where < 30% is content."
- PA-51 (C): "Does the page feel content-dense, balanced, sparse, or void-dominated?"
- PA-66 (C): "Look at the empty spaces between sections. Are they all the same 'flavor' of emptiness?"

**Assessment:** These are NOT redundant despite sharing the "space" domain. PA-31 is qualitative (designed vs leftover), PA-33 is specific (largest void), PA-50 is quantitative (counting), PA-51 is impressionistic (overall density), PA-66 is about variety (different gap types). They form a coherent SPATIAL AUDIT BATTERY. However, concentrating 5 space-related questions in one auditor (C) creates a spatial-analysis monoculture — C's answers will be internally consistent but may miss a non-spatial-expert's perspective on voids.

**Cluster 2: Transitions / Boundaries (5 questions)**
- PA-34 (D): "Pick a transition between two major sections. Is it a DESIGNED moment or just empty space?"
- PA-62 (D): "Find a section transition. Count how many visual properties change simultaneously."
- PA-69 (D): "Pick two section transitions. Count visual properties changing. Are transition intensities varied?"
- PA-71 (D): "At the boundary between two adjacent zones, does the transition feel like a smooth handoff or an abrupt collision?"
- PA-74 (D): "Pick a boundary where the page changes. Do ALL the changes point in the same direction?"

**Assessment:** These overlap more significantly. PA-34 and PA-71 both ask about transition quality (designed moment vs collision). PA-62 and PA-69 both count visual properties at transitions. The key differentiators:
- PA-34: single transition, qualitative (designed moment)
- PA-62: single transition, quantitative (property count) + variation (dramatic vs quiet)
- PA-69: TWO transitions, comparative (varied vs uniform) + coherence (agree vs contradict)
- PA-71: feel-based (handoff vs collision) + content alignment
- PA-74: direction agreement (all darker = coherent)

**Finding OVERLAP-01 (LOW): PA-34 and PA-71 substantially overlap.** Both assess whether transitions between sections feel intentional. PA-34 ("designed moment or just empty space") and PA-71 ("smooth handoff or abrupt collision") probe the same perceptual property from slightly different angles. **Consolidation opportunity:** Merge into a single question that captures both dimensions: "At 2 section transitions, assess: (a) is it a designed moment or just empty space? (b) Does it feel like a handoff or a collision? (c) Does the transition technique match the content shift?"

**Finding OVERLAP-02 (LOW): PA-62 and PA-69 partially overlap.** Both count properties at transitions. PA-62 is single-transition; PA-69 is comparative (2 transitions). PA-69 subsumes PA-62's counting dimension and adds the variation and coherence dimensions. However, PA-62 explicitly asks for "dramatic vs quiet" identification which is a Tier 5 question about compositional depth. **No consolidation recommended** — PA-62 is a Tier 5 detection question with a specific threshold (3+ changes = dramatic), while PA-69 is a pipeline integration question.

**Cluster 3: Metaphor Persistence (3 questions)**
- PA-44 (G): "Without labels/headings/text annotations, could you still sense the metaphor from visual structure alone? Does it persist across the ENTIRE page?"
- PA-68 (G): "Does the page's organizing metaphor persist across ALL scroll thirds?"
- PA-52 (D): "Divide page into thirds. Does each third have at least one designed moment?"

**Assessment:** PA-44 and PA-68 overlap substantially. Both ask about metaphor persistence across the full page. PA-44 adds the "without labels" dimension (structural vs announced metaphor). PA-68 adds scroll-third specificity. PA-52 is different — it asks about "designed moments" not metaphor specifically.

**Finding OVERLAP-03 (LOW): PA-44 and PA-68 probe overlapping territory.** The two questions are in different auditors (G vs G — actually both in G), which means the same auditor answers both. This is not a routing problem but a question design problem — a single auditor answering two metaphor-persistence questions will likely give consistent (hence non-independent) answers. **Consolidation opportunity:** Merge into one question: "Can you sense the organizing metaphor from visual structure alone (without reading labels)? Does it persist across all three scroll thirds, or fade?"

### 7.2 Consolidation Summary

| Finding | Questions | Recommendation | Impact on Count |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| OVERLAP-01 | PA-34 + PA-71 | CONSIDER merging | 69 → 68 |
| OVERLAP-02 | PA-62 + PA-69 | KEEP separate (different purposes) | — |
| OVERLAP-03 | PA-44 + PA-68 | CONSIDER merging | 68 → 67 |

**Conservative recommendation:** Keep all 69. The overlaps provide redundancy that catches different facets. The cost of a few extra answers is low compared to the risk of losing a dimension.

## 8. Ambiguous Scoring Anchors

### 8.1 Questions with Clear Binary/Threshold Anchors (EXEMPLARY)

These questions have explicit YES/NO thresholds that minimize judgment:

| ID | Threshold |
|----|-----------|
| PA-50 | "< 30% content" — quantitative |
| PA-53 | "65-80% horizontal space" — quantitative |
| PA-60 | ">= 3 distinct moments, >= 2 in different scroll thirds" |
| PA-62 | ">= 1 dramatic boundary (3+) AND >= 1 quiet boundary (1-2)" |
| PA-63 | "Component mirrors page language at BOTH scales AND auditor can NAME the shared language" |
| PA-81 | "Answer 'What is the ONE thing' in under 5 seconds" |

### 8.2 Questions with AMBIGUOUS Scoring (Judgment-Based)

**HIGH AMBIGUITY (no threshold, purely subjective):**

| ID | Question Essence | Problem |
|----|-----------------|---------|
| PA-03 | "One designer or three?" | No threshold. What does "two designers" mean? All multi-section pages will have some dialect variation. |
| PA-11 | "Generous (confident) or anxious (clutching)?" | Metaphorical language with no anchor. What pixel margin separates "confident" from "anxious"? |
| PA-19 | "Element from a different website?" | No threshold for "different." A subtle font inconsistency vs a jarring color break are different severities, both "from a different website." |
| PA-20 | "Personality in three words — does visual match verbal?" | Entirely subjective personality attribution. Two auditors will pick different words and reach different conclusions. |
| PA-31 | "Space feels designed or leftover?" | Pure gestalt judgment with no scoring anchor. |
| PA-35 | "Where do you start skimming?" | Varies by individual attention span, not page quality. |
| PA-45 | "Single moment you would show someone?" | Subjective taste question. |
| PA-48 | "First or last choice among five?" | Hypothetical comparison with no reference set. |
| PA-51 | "Content-dense, balanced, sparse, or void-dominated?" | 4-way classification with no thresholds. |

**Finding AMBIG-01 (LOW): 9 questions have purely judgment-based scoring with no anchors.** This is by design — the PA protocol explicitly values fresh perceptual judgment over mechanical measurement. The pa-guardrails.md file provides general scoring guidance, and the Weaver synthesizes across auditors to smooth individual judgment variation. This is not a defect but a deliberate architectural choice: breadth of independent subjective assessments reveals more than narrow mechanical checks.

**MEDIUM AMBIGUITY (partial threshold):**

| ID | Question Essence | Problem |
|----|-----------------|---------|
| PA-29 | "Count text styles in header — more than 3 fighting for attention?" | "Fighting for attention" is subjective; count is objective. The threshold (>3) is clear but "fighting" interpretation varies. |
| PA-47 | "At what scroll position do you feel 'seen this before'?" | Depends on page length, content type, and auditor patience. |
| PA-72 | "Would the design need to change for different content?" | Hypothetical that requires imagination, not observation. |
| PA-76 | "Does the visual journey have a shape?" | "Shape" is metaphorical. The scoring criteria ("building, peaking, resolving") help but are still interpretive. |

**Finding AMBIG-02 (LOW): 4 additional questions have partial anchors that still require significant interpretation.** The questions are useful but their inter-rater reliability would be low.

### 8.3 Scoring Anchor Coverage

| Category | Count | % of 69 |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Clear binary/threshold | 24 | 35% |
| Moderate clarity (anchors + some judgment) | 32 | 46% |
| High ambiguity (pure judgment) | 9 | 13% |
| Medium ambiguity (partial threshold) | 4 | 6% |

**Overall: 81% of questions have moderate or better scoring clarity. The 13% pure-judgment questions are concentrated in Auditors A (PA-03, PA-45), C (PA-11, PA-31, PA-51), G (PA-19, PA-20), and H (PA-47) + I (PA-48).**

## 9. Tier 5 Question Audit (PA-60 through PA-68)

### 9.1 Assignment Verification

| ID | Defined Auditor (pa-questions.md) | Deployed Auditor (pa-deployment.md) | MANIFEST.md | Match? |
|----|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| PA-60 | F | F | F | MATCH |
| PA-61 | F | F | F | MATCH |
| PA-62 | D | D | D | MATCH |
| PA-63 | E | E | E | MATCH |
| PA-64 | C | C | C | MATCH |
| PA-65 | A | A | A | MATCH |
| PA-66 | C | C | C | MATCH |
| PA-67 | A | A | A | MATCH |
| PA-68 | G | G | G | MATCH |

**All 9 Tier 5 questions are consistently assigned across all 3 source files.**

### 9.2 Auditor Distribution of Tier 5

| Auditor | Tier 5 Questions | Count |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| A | PA-65, PA-67 | 2 |
| B | — | 0 |
| C | PA-64, PA-66 | 2 |
| D | PA-62 | 1 |
| E | PA-63 | 1 |
| F | PA-60, PA-61 | 2 |
| G | PA-68 | 1 |
| H | — | 0 |
| I | — | 0 |

**Finding TIER5-01 (INFO): Auditors B, H, and I have zero Tier 5 questions.** B (readability), H (responsive), and I (adversarial) are excluded from Flagship detection. This is architecturally sound — Flagship detection is about compositional depth, not readability/responsiveness/adversarial resistance.

### 9.3 Do Tier 5 Questions Actually Detect Flagship Quality?

Each Tier 5 question probes a specific layer of the Compositional Intelligence Stack:

| ID | Stack Layer | Detection Target | Effective? |
|----|------------|------------------|------------|
| PA-60 | Design Moment Density | Unique visual treatments | YES — DESIGNED pages have non-repeated visual events |
| PA-61 | Multi-Voice Composition | Independent property rhythms | YES — the hallmark of compositional depth vs template repetition |
| PA-62 | Transition Variation | Dramatic vs quiet boundaries | YES — COMPOSED pages modulate transition intensity |
| PA-63 | Fractal Zoom Coherence | Design language at multiple scales | YES — the strongest Flagship signal (design language echoes at component, section, and page level) |
| PA-64 | Restraint as Expression | Deliberate simplicity | YES — DESIGNED restraint vs ASSEMBLED absence |
| PA-65 | Compositional Voice | Ensemble vs unison | MODERATE — music analogy requires interpretive leap, may produce inconsistent answers across auditors |
| PA-66 | Negative Space Variety | Different gap "flavors" | YES — perceptible gap variation is a COMPOSED-level signal |
| PA-67 | Novelty Beyond Competence | Unpredicted visual element | MODERATE — "novelty" is content-dependent; a conservative content type may be excellent without novelty |
| PA-68 | Metaphor Spatial Coverage | Metaphor persists across thirds | YES — Flagship requires pervading metaphor, this directly tests it |

**Finding TIER5-02 (LOW): PA-65 and PA-67 are the weakest Flagship detectors.**
- PA-65 (music analogy): The question relies on the auditor understanding musical composition metaphors. An auditor unfamiliar with ensemble music may default to (b) "choir" for any coherent page, underscoring COMPOSED but missing FLAGSHIP.
- PA-67 (novelty): Novelty is not inherent to Flagship quality. A page can achieve Flagship compositional depth through masterful execution of conventional techniques without any "surprising" elements. The question's YES criterion ("names specific unpredictable visual element AND it serves the content") is well-designed but the dimension itself is not a necessary Flagship indicator.

### 9.4 Missing PA Question IDs in the 60-68 Range

pa-questions.md header says "PA-60 through PA-68" and Section 2.2 defines exactly 9 questions. However, the memory file references "PA-60 through PA-81" and "PA-60 through PA-77" in different places. Let me clarify:

- PA-60 through PA-68: Tier 5 (9 questions) — defined in Section 2
- PA-69 through PA-71: Pipeline Integration (3 questions) — defined in Section 3.8
- PA-72 through PA-77: Extended Assessment (6 questions) — defined in Section 3.10
- PA-80: Navigation Usability (1 question) — defined in Section 3.8a
- PA-81: Information Extraction (1 question) — in Tier 2

**Gap IDs: PA-78, PA-79 are undefined.** These are gaps in the numbering sequence between PA-77 (Extended) and PA-80 (Navigation). This is noted but not a routing issue.

### 9.5 Tier 5 Scoring Integration

pa-questions.md Section 4.3 defines Tier 5 scoring thresholds:
- 8-9/9 = COMPOSED
- 6-7/9 = APPROACHING
- 3-5/9 = STRUCTURED
- 0-2/9 = VOCABULARY ONLY

pa-questions.md Section 4.4 provides a Combined Verdict Matrix (PA-05 x Tier 5).

These are marked as PROVISIONAL (N=1 validation). **This is correctly flagged and appropriately cautious.**

---

## 10. PA-05 Cross-Validation Routing

pa-deployment.md Section 1.3 defines a cross-validation protocol where 4 auditors provide secondary PA-05 sub-criterion scores:

| Sub-Criterion | Primary | Cross-Validator | Questions Used to Inform |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| DESIGNED (PA-05a) | A | F | PA-16, PA-17, PA-41, PA-60, PA-61 |
| COHERENT (PA-05b) | A | G | PA-18, PA-19, PA-20, PA-42-44, PA-54, PA-68 |
| PROPORTIONATE (PA-05c) | A | C | PA-11, PA-30-33, PA-50, PA-51, PA-53, PA-64, PA-66 |
| POLISHED (PA-05d) | A | B | PA-02, PA-08, PA-29, PA-55, PA-56, PA-70, PA-77, PA-81 |

**The cross-validators are the correct auditors for each sub-criterion.** Each cross-validator's core domain directly corresponds to the PA-05 sub-criterion they validate:
- F (Consistency + Rhythm) validates DESIGNED — mechanisms in conversation
- G (Metaphor + Ideology) validates COHERENT — one design voice
- C (Spatial + Proportion) validates PROPORTIONATE — spatial balance
- B (Readability + Typography) validates POLISHED — execution quality

**Finding CV-01 (INFO): Cross-validation increases PA-05 reliability from N=1 to N=2 per sub-criterion.** This is a significant improvement. The blind cross-validation design (cross-validators don't see A's scores) is correct.

**Finding CV-02 (LOW): Auditors D, E, H, and I provide no cross-validation.** This is acceptable — their domains don't map cleanly to PA-05 sub-criteria.

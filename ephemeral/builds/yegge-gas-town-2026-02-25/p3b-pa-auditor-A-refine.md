## 0. Experiential Pass

I am looking at this page with no prior knowledge of its build process. Here is what I see scrolling through as a first-time reader.

**1440-z0-header.png:** A dark, warm charcoal header. "DEEP DIVE -- LEVEL 7" in small red-orange uppercase letters sits above a large decorative serif title "Steve Yegge and Gas Town" in white/cream. Below the title, a lighter gray subtitle: "The agent factory architect building team-scale productivity for solo developers." Four small bordered tag pills sit underneath: ORCHESTRATION, AGENT FACTORY, VIBE CODING, STAGE 7+. A bright red-orange horizontal rule marks the bottom edge of the header, creating a sharp, confident transition to the lighter zone below. My immediate impression: this header looks bold and intentional. The serif title font has character -- it feels editorial, almost magazine-like.

**1440-cold-look.png / 1440-z1-orientation.png:** The page transitions to a warm cream/off-white background. A section label "S0 -- ORIENTATION" in small spaced uppercase appears, followed by the decorative serif heading "You Are Here." Below is a code-block-style box with a left border accent showing a "complexity ladder" from Level 0 to Level 7 in monospace. The box has a warm tinted background. Two body-text paragraphs follow, readable and comfortably sized. Then a "PREREQUISITES" box with a red-orange label and a list of bullet items on a slightly different warm background. Section transitions to "S1 -- BIOGRAPHY" with another decorative serif heading "Who is Steve Yegge?" followed by body text and a clean table (Company / Role / Relevance) with alternating or subtly separated rows. An "ESSENCE" callout box with red-orange label contains an italicized quote in a decorative font. Below, "Why His Opinion Matters" with a bulleted list using small red-orange square markers. This entire zone reads well -- text is comfortable, the hierarchy is clear, and there is visual variety without chaos.

**1440-z1-orientation.png (lower) / 1440-z2-mental-model.png:** A transition to a slightly different warm background introduces "S2 -- CORE CONCEPT" and "The Gas Town Mental Model." A blockquote with a left border accent contains an italicized quote attributed to "STEVE YEGGE." Then body text, followed by a two-column comparison card: "TRADITIONAL APPROACH" vs "GAS TOWN APPROACH" -- each in its own bordered box. More body text. Then "S3 -- ARCHITECTURE" with "The 8 Roles Architecture" and a diagram showing a role hierarchy (Town Level / Rig Level / Human Level) with boxes connected by lines -- this is rendered as an image or structured element on a dark background. Below the diagram is another clean table (Role / Level / Function / Model). The transition from light to dark happens at a horizontal rule reading "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" in red-orange centered text -- a very strong, designed transition moment.

**1440-z3-infrastructure.png:** Now on a dark background. "S4 -- MEMORY INFRASTRUCTURE" with "Beads: The Memory System." A "THE PROBLEM" callout with a quote in italics on a darker-tinted card. Body text in light color on dark background. Three context-type cards (Hot Context / Warm Context / Cold Context) arranged in a partial grid -- two side by side, one below. "Key Commands" in a dark code block with monospace. A "WHY GIT AS DATABASE?" callout. Then "S5 -- EVOLUTION FRAMEWORK" with "The 6 Waves of AI" and a table (Wave / Era / Description / Productivity). Below that, "The 8 Stages of Dev Evolution" -- another table. A "CRITICAL WARNING" callout in red-orange tones with a quote about Stage 7. Then "S6 -- PRINCIPLES" with "Core Principles" and a series of principle cards (stacked, each with a bold title and body text on slightly tinted dark cards). All readable, though the dark zone is dense with information. The red-orange accents pop nicely against the dark background.

**1440-z4-practice.png:** Transition back to light background at "HANDS IN PRACTICE" horizontal rule. "S7 -- IMPLEMENTATION" with "Implementation Guide." Installation code blocks, a "CHECKPOINT" box, "Starting the Core Roles" with bulleted commands, another checkpoint, "Tmux Workflow" with a large code block, "Daily Workflow" with another code block. Then "S8 -- VERIFICATION" with "Checkpoints and Verification" and a table (Step / Command / Expected Output), "Health Checks" code block, "HEALTHY STATE INDICATORS" callout. "S9 -- TROUBLESHOOTING" with collapsible/expandable troubleshooting items (Context Collapse, Race Conditions, Runaway Crew, Mayor Deadlock, Beads Desync, Agent Won't Start). "Recovery Command Reference" code block.

**1440-z4-practice.png (lower) / 1440-z5-element.png:** A decision guide section: "S10 -- DECISION GUIDE" with "When to Use Gas Town" -- two-column layout: "USE GAS TOWN WHEN" (green markers) and "DO NOT USE GAS TOWN WHEN" (red markers). A "DECISION TREE" code-style flowchart on a tinted background. "S11 -- KEY STATEMENTS" with "Quotes and Key Statements" -- a large featured quote in a warm-tinted card, then a 2x3 grid of smaller quote cards, each with attribution. "S12 -- COMPARISONS" with "Comparison with Other Patterns" -- two comparison tables (Gas Town vs Ralph Wigsum, Gas Town vs CC Mirror). An "ARCHITECT" callout. "S13 -- SOURCES" with "Sources" -- Primary Sources (linked list) and Community Extensions (2x2 grid of tool cards with names and descriptions).

**1440-footer.png:** The footer is essentially dark/empty in the captured screenshot -- I see a very dark bar at the bottom. From the z4-practice screenshot I can see the very bottom of the page: three footer columns (LEARNING, COMPLEXITY, AUTHOR) with small text, and a centered closing quote in italics at the very bottom. The footer is present but compact.

**1440-z5-resolution.png:** This screenshot is entirely dark -- appears to be a DPR rendering issue as noted. The content from this zone is visible in other screenshots.

**768px screenshots:** The page adapts well at 768px. The header retains its structure but title is smaller. Content fills the width more fully. Tables remain readable. The two-column comparison cards stack vertically. The role hierarchy diagram is still visible. Code blocks adapt. The quote grid appears to stack into single-column at 768px. Overall the responsive behavior looks considered, not just shrunk.

**Text I CANNOT read from pixels alone:**
- In `1440-z3-start.png`, `1440-threshold-z2-z3.png`, `1440-z4-start.png`, `1440-z4-content.png`: These screenshots are entirely or nearly entirely dark with no visible content -- appears to be a rendering/capture issue.
- The `1440-nav-rail.png` shows a tiny dark vertical sliver -- cannot discern any content.
- In the role hierarchy diagram (1440-z2-mental-model.png, top), the box labels are small but I can make out "MAYOR," "DEACON," "DOGS," "REFINERY," "WITNESS," "POLECAT," "CREW," "OVERSEER (YOU)" reasonably well.
- Some attribution text under the smaller quote cards in the quotes section is very small -- I can partially read names but not all clearly.
- The footer text in the three footer columns is quite small; I can make out category labels but not all individual entries.

**Overall first impression:** This is a well-structured, visually varied long-form technical document. It has clear editorial personality, a warm palette that feels intentional, strong zone transitions (especially the light-to-dark shift), and good information hierarchy. It does not look like a generic template -- the decorative serif headings, the red-orange accent system, and the alternating light/dark zones give it a distinct character. It is content-dense but not overwhelming. The page has a clear beginning (orientation), middle (architecture + infrastructure), and end (practice + sources).

## 1. PA-01: What's the first thing that bothers you?

**ANSWER: CONDITIONAL**

The first thing that bothers me is the cluster of dark screenshots that rendered as entirely blank (`1440-z3-start.png`, `1440-threshold-z2-z3.png`, `1440-z4-start.png`, `1440-z4-content.png`). Setting aside the screenshot capture issue -- looking at the actual content visible in the zone-level screenshots:

The thing that most catches my eye as a concern is the **density of the dark zone (Z3 infrastructure)**. [`1440-z3-infrastructure.png`] This section packs Beads, 6 Waves of AI, 8 Stages of Dev Evolution, Core Principles -- all into one long dark-background run. Each sub-section is well-designed individually, but the cumulative effect of scrolling through all of them on dark background without a break creates fatigue. By the time I reach the "Core Principles" cards, I have been on dark background for a very long scroll. The transition markers ("ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" and "HANDS IN PRACTICE") are excellent design moments, but the distance between them is substantial.

A secondary bother: some of the smaller attribution text under quote cards [`1440-z4-practice.png`, lower section with quotes grid] is difficult to read at the rendered size.

**Evidence:** `1440-z3-infrastructure.png` -- long continuous dark zone; `1440-z4-practice.png` -- small attribution text under quotes.

---

## 2. PA-03: Does this feel like one designer made it, or three?

**ANSWER: YES -- feels like one designer**

This page has a remarkably unified visual voice. Evidence:

1. **Typography system is consistent throughout.** [`1440-z1-orientation.png`, `1440-z3-infrastructure.png`, `1440-z4-practice.png`] The decorative serif font is used for ALL section headings ("You Are Here," "Who is Steve Yegge?," "Beads: The Memory System," "Implementation Guide," "Quotes and Key Statements"). Body text uses the same sans-serif throughout. Section labels ("S0 -- ORIENTATION," "S4 -- MEMORY INFRASTRUCTURE") use the same small spaced uppercase treatment everywhere.

2. **Accent color system is consistent.** The red-orange accent appears in section labels, callout labels ("PREREQUISITES," "ESSENCE," "THE PROBLEM," "CRITICAL WARNING," "CHECKPOINT," "HEALTHY STATE INDICATORS"), the header rule, transition markers, and bullet markers. It never shifts to a different accent color.

3. **Component vocabulary repeats coherently.** Callout boxes with colored labels appear in both light and dark zones. Tables share the same structure and spacing. Code blocks use the same treatment on light and dark backgrounds. Quote cards use the same italic decorative serif.

4. **The light-dark-light zone structure feels planned, not collaged.** The transitions are marked with explicit designed moments (horizontal rules + centered text labels), and the component vocabulary adapts to each zone background without breaking identity.

I see no "dialect shifts" -- no section that looks like it was borrowed from a different design system. The footer matches the header in weight and tone. The only slight tension is that the dark zone is so much longer than the first light zone, which creates an asymmetry in pacing -- but this is a content decision, not a design inconsistency.

**Evidence:** `1440-z0-header.png` (accent system established), `1440-z1-orientation.png` (light zone vocabulary), `1440-z3-infrastructure.png` (dark zone vocabulary -- same language, adapted), `1440-z4-practice.png` (light zone vocabulary returns consistently).

## 3. PA-04: Where does your eye go first? Is that where it SHOULD go?

**ANSWER: YES**

At the header [`1440-z0-header.png`], my eye goes immediately to the large decorative serif title "Steve Yegge and Gas Town" -- it is the largest and highest-contrast element (white on dark). This is exactly where it should go: the title tells me what this page is about.

When I scroll to the first content section [`1440-z1-orientation.png`], my eye lands on the "You Are Here" heading, which orients me immediately. The complexity ladder code block draws the eye next because it has a distinct background and a left border accent. This is good: orientation first, then context.

In the dark zone [`1440-z3-infrastructure.png`], the red-orange section labels and heading fonts draw the eye to each new sub-section entry point. The callout boxes with their colored labels create natural stopping points.

On the quotes page [`1440-z4-practice.png`, lower], the featured quote "Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant." is the largest and most prominently placed element -- eye goes there first, which is appropriate for a key statements section.

At no point does my eye go to something trivial (a decorative element, a margin, a piece of chrome) before it goes to the primary content of each viewport. The visual hierarchy works.

**Evidence:** `1440-z0-header.png` (title dominates), `1440-cold-look.png` (first content viewport -- heading + code block draw eye correctly), `1440-z3-infrastructure.png` (section headings in decorative serif + red-orange labels guide eye), `1440-z4-practice.png` (featured quote is dominant in quotes section).

## 4. PA-05: Would you put your name on this? What would you fix first?

### PA-05a: DESIGNED -- Does this feel like intentional composition, or assembled components?

**PASS**

This feels like intentional composition. The evidence:

- **Multi-scale coherence:** The page operates at macro scale (light-dark-light zone architecture), meso scale (section-level pacing with distinct component types per section), and micro scale (consistent accent colors, border treatments, typography hierarchy within each component). [`1440-full-page.png` shows the macro rhythm; `1440-z1-orientation.png` shows meso-level variety within a section.]

- **Rhythm variation:** The page is not metronomic. The orientation section is relatively airy (heading + code block + text). The biography section introduces a table and a quote callout. The mental model section introduces a two-column comparison. The architecture section introduces a diagram. Each section brings a different component type, keeping the scroll interesting. [`1440-z1-orientation.png` through `1440-z2-mental-model.png` show progression of component types.]

- **Focal points placed deliberately:** The "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" transition [`1440-z2-mental-model.png`, bottom] is a dramatic designed moment -- horizontal rule + centered red-orange text marking a tonal shift. "HANDS IN PRACTICE" performs the same function returning to light. The featured quote card in S11 is another clear focal point. These are NOT accidental.

- **Content-form resonance:** The choice to put infrastructure/architecture content on a dark background (evoking a terminal/factory) and implementation/practice content on light background (evoking documentation/desk work) serves THIS content specifically. The "factory floor" metaphor is visually enacted, not just labeled.

**Verdict: A designer made choices for THIS content.**

### PA-05b: COHERENT -- Does this feel like one designer made it?

**PASS**

Covered in PA-03 above. Same design intent is visible from header through footer. No dialect shifts. The decorative serif + red-orange accent + warm palette + callout-box vocabulary persists throughout. Components adapt to their zone (light vs dark) but maintain identity.

**Evidence:** `1440-z0-header.png`, `1440-z1-orientation.png`, `1440-z3-infrastructure.png`, `1440-z4-practice.png` -- all show the same visual language adapted to context.

### PA-05c: PROPORTIONATE -- Does the spatial balance feel considered?

**CONDITIONAL PASS**

- **3a. Horizontal Proportion:** PASS. Content fills a confident portion of the viewport at 1440px. [`1440-cold-look.png`] The content container appears to occupy roughly 65-70% of viewport width. Margins are generous without being wasteful. The content does not feel like a narrow strip, nor does it feel edge-to-edge cramped.

- **3b. Vertical Proportion:** PASS. Each third of the page has designed moments. Top third: header + orientation + biography with table + quote. Middle third: architecture diagram + roles table + Beads section + waves tables. Bottom third: implementation guide + verification + troubleshooting + quotes grid + comparison tables + sources + footer. Every third has visual peaks.

- **3c. Breathing Proportion:** CONDITIONAL. Most empty space feels purposeful -- the gaps between sections read as breathing room, and the transition markers fill what would otherwise be dead space. However, the gap between the end of the light Z1 content and the "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" marker [`1440-z2-mental-model.png`, around the transition area] has a stretch where the dark background begins and content hasn't yet appeared. It is not catastrophic, but it is the one place where space feels slightly like "waiting" rather than "breathing." Also, the very bottom of the dark Z3 zone, before transitioning back to light, has a noticeable empty dark stretch [`1440-z3-infrastructure.png`, bottom portion before `1440-z4-practice.png` begins].

All three sub-dimensions effectively pass, but 3c has a mild concern. I rate this CONDITIONAL PASS -- the breathing proportion is 90% purposeful but has two spots where the gap feels slightly generous.

### PA-05d: POLISHED -- Is execution quality high?

**PASS**

- Footer is present [`1440-z4-practice.png`, very bottom -- three columns + closing quote visible].
- No missing elements spotted. All sections have headings, content, and appropriate components.
- Transitions are typed -- the "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" and "HANDS IN PRACTICE" markers are distinct from regular section spacing.
- No stray artifacts, broken layouts, or orphaned elements visible.
- Code blocks are consistently styled. Tables are consistently structured.
- The tag pills in the header are neatly aligned. The callout boxes are consistently formatted.
- Token compliance appears high -- the accent color, typography, and spacing feel systematic.

One minor polish note: some of the small attribution text under secondary quote cards is quite small and potentially hard to read for some users [`1440-z4-practice.png`, quotes grid section]. This is a polish concern but not a shipping blocker.

**Verdict: Ready to ship as-is with minor text size consideration.**

### PA-05 OVERALL SCORE: 3.5/4 -- YES WITH RESERVATIONS

Sub-criteria: DESIGNED (PASS), COHERENT (PASS), PROPORTIONATE (CONDITIONAL PASS), POLISHED (PASS). Three clean passes + one conditional pass = 3.5/4.

The conditional on PROPORTIONATE comes from two breathing gaps in zone transitions. Fix those and this is a clean 4/4.

**What I would fix first:** Tighten the gap at the light-to-dark transition (just before "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR") and the gap at the end of the dark zone (just before "HANDS IN PRACTICE") so the breathing space feels like an intentional pause, not a gap between design decisions.

---

## 5. PA-45: Is there a single moment you would show someone as an example of good design? Point to it.

**ANSWER: YES**

The **"ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" transition** [`1440-z2-mental-model.png`, bottom area]. This is the single moment I would show someone. Here is why:

A horizontal rule in the accent color spans the content width. Below it, centered red-orange uppercase text reads "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR." Below that, the background shifts from warm cream to dark charcoal, and the content shifts from conceptual (mental model, architecture overview) to infrastructure (Beads, waves, principles). The transition:

1. Is visually dramatic (color shift, horizontal rule, typographic mark)
2. Is semantically meaningful (the content literally moves from theory to infrastructure)
3. Uses the page's own metaphor (Gas Town = factory; you are now entering the factory)
4. Creates anticipation (the label tells you something is changing before the dark zone begins)

This is not just a section divider -- it is a narrative moment enacted through visual design. It serves THIS content in a way that would not transfer to arbitrary content. It is the best example of design-as-storytelling on this page.

**Runner-up:** The featured quote card "Build a colony of coding agents, not the world's largest ant." [`1440-z4-practice.png`, quotes section] -- larger warm-toned card with decorative italic serif, clear visual emphasis distinguishing it from the secondary quotes.

**Evidence:** `1440-z2-mental-model.png` (transition visible at bottom of screenshot).

---

## 6. PA-65: Compositional Voice / Music Analogy

**ANSWER: YES -- Ensemble (c), with named instruments**

If this page were a piece of music, it would be an **ensemble with different parts**. I can name at least three independent "instruments":

1. **The decorative serif headings** -- these are the melody line. They appear at each section entry, set the emotional tone (editorial, authoritative, slightly literary), and guide the listener through the progression. They have their own rhythm: appearing at predictable section starts but with varying size and weight.

2. **The red-orange accent system** -- this is the percussion/rhythm section. It pulses through the page at irregular but purposeful intervals: section labels, callout labels, transition markers, bullet markers, the header rule. It keeps time without being metronomic. Sometimes it appears as a small label ("PREREQUISITES"), sometimes as a dramatic horizontal rule ("ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR"). Same voice, different dynamics.

3. **The light/dark zone alternation** -- this is the harmonic foundation, like a chord progression. It creates the macro structure: major key (light, airy, conceptual) -> minor key (dark, dense, technical) -> major key (light, practical, applied). The zone shifts are the key changes that give the piece its dramatic arc.

4. **The component vocabulary (tables, code blocks, callouts, quote cards)** -- this is the ensemble texture. Different instruments (components) enter and exit. Tables appear in the biography and infrastructure sections. Code blocks dominate the implementation section. Quote cards cluster in the key statements section. Each brings its own timbre.

These instruments have **independent rhythms** -- the accent color pulses more frequently than the zone shifts, the headings appear at their own pace, and the component variety follows content needs rather than a fixed pattern. Yet they feel coordinated, not random.

**Evidence:** `1440-full-page.png` (macro zone rhythm visible), `1440-z1-orientation.png` (heading + accent + component interaction at section level), `1440-z3-infrastructure.png` (all instruments playing in dark-zone adaptation).

---

## 7. PA-67: Novelty Beyond Competence

**ANSWER: YES**

The specific unpredictable visual element: **The "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" / "HANDS IN PRACTICE" narrative transition markers.**

For a technical deep-dive document about AI agent orchestration, I would predict: headers, body text, code blocks, tables, maybe a diagram. I would NOT predict that the page would have named, theatrical transition moments that enact a spatial metaphor (entering a factory floor, putting hands into practice). These markers are a surprise because:

1. Technical documents almost never name their tonal shifts. They just have section dividers.
2. The markers create a sense of physical movement ("entering" a space, "putting hands" into something) for content that is entirely abstract.
3. They serve dual purpose: visual break (horizontal rule + text) AND narrative structure (telling the reader where they are in the journey).

**Does the surprise serve the content?** Yes. The Gas Town metaphor is about an AI agent factory. Framing the architectural content as "the factory floor" and the implementation content as "hands in practice" reinforces the central metaphor of the content itself. The surprise is content-aligned, not decorative.

A secondary novelty: the decorative serif heading font choice for a technical document. This is unusual -- most technical content uses clean sans-serif headings. The serif choice gives the page an editorial/magazine quality that elevates it above "documentation" into "long-form technical essay." This serves the content because the content IS a long-form essay about a person's philosophy, not just a how-to guide.

**Evidence:** `1440-z2-mental-model.png` (ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR transition), `1440-z4-practice.png` (HANDS IN PRACTICE transition), `1440-z0-header.png` (decorative serif title).

---

## 8. PA-72: Content Specificity -- Would this design work for anything?

**ANSWER: CONDITIONAL -- The design is moderately content-specific**

If I replaced this content with a cooking recipe:

**What WOULD need to change:**
- The "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" and "HANDS IN PRACTICE" transition markers are directly tied to the factory/workshop metaphor of Gas Town. A cooking recipe would need different transition language.
- The light-dark-light zone structure currently maps to theory-infrastructure-practice. For a cooking recipe, this mapping would not make semantic sense (why would ingredients be on a dark background?).
- The tag pills (ORCHESTRATION, AGENT FACTORY, VIBE CODING, STAGE 7+) are content-specific categorization.
- The "Complexity Ladder" code block in the orientation section is specific to this content's progressive learning framework.

**What WOULD work for anything:**
- The typography system (decorative serif headings + sans-serif body) is genre-appropriate for long-form content but not content-specific.
- The table formatting, code block styling, and callout box components are generic.
- The warm cream + charcoal + red-orange palette could work for many types of content.
- The section-label system ("S0 -- ORIENTATION" etc.) is structural, not content-specific.

**Assessment:** The design is approximately 60% content-specific, 40% generic. The zone structure and transition markers are the most content-tailored elements. The component vocabulary and palette are more transferable. This is better than a fully generic template (which would score 0% content-specific) but not at the level where every visual decision is inseparable from the content (which would be 100%).

The design serves THIS content noticeably better than it would serve arbitrary content. The factory metaphor and the theory/infrastructure/practice arc are enacted visually, not just labeled.

**Evidence:** `1440-z2-mental-model.png` (transition marker = content-specific), `1440-z1-orientation.png` (complexity ladder = content-specific), `1440-z0-header.png` (tag pills = content-specific), `1440-z4-practice.png` (component vocabulary = more generic).

## 9. PA-76: Visual Journey Shape

**ANSWER: YES -- The visual journey has a clear shape**

Scrolling from top to bottom at reading speed, the journey has a **three-act arc: build, peak, resolve.**

**Act 1 -- BUILDING (header through biography):** [`1440-z0-header.png`, `1440-z1-orientation.png`] The page opens with a confident dark header, transitions to warm light, and introduces increasingly complex content: orientation (simple text + code block) -> biography (text + table + quote) -> mental model (text + quote + comparison cards). The visual density gently increases. Interest builds because each section introduces a new component type.

**Act 2 -- PEAK (architecture through principles):** [`1440-z2-mental-model.png` bottom, `1440-z3-infrastructure.png`] The "ENTERING THE FACTORY FLOOR" transition is the dramatic peak -- the moment of highest visual intensity. The dark zone that follows is the sustained climax: dense, information-rich, multiple tables, diagrams, code blocks, warning callouts. This is where the page is working hardest visually and informationally. The peak is in approximately the right place -- slightly past the midpoint, which creates the satisfying asymmetry of a longer build than resolution.

**Act 3 -- RESOLVING (implementation through footer):** [`1440-z4-practice.png`] "HANDS IN PRACTICE" marks the return to light. The implementation section is practical and steady -- code blocks and verification tables are predictable and calming after the density of the dark zone. The troubleshooting accordions and comparison tables wind down the complexity. The quotes section provides a moment of reflection. The sources section and footer close the page cleanly.

**Where is the peak?** The peak is the light-to-dark transition and the early dark zone (Beads + Waves). This corresponds to approximately the 35-45% scroll mark, which is a narratively satisfying placement.

**Does the ending feel earned?** Yes. The page earns its ending by progressing through orientation -> context -> theory -> infrastructure -> practice -> verification -> reflection -> sources. The footer's closing quote provides a final punctuation mark. It does not just stop -- it resolves.

**Where do I start skimming?** Around the middle of the dark zone, at the "8 Stages of Dev Evolution" table [`1440-z3-infrastructure.png`]. By this point I have already absorbed the Waves table and the density of information is high. This is the one spot where the sustained dark zone creates mild fatigue. The "Core Principles" cards after this feel slightly repetitive in structure (stacked cards, stacked cards, stacked cards). But the "HANDS IN PRACTICE" transition re-engages me by signaling a change.

**Evidence:** `1440-full-page.png` (full arc visible -- light/dark/light rhythm), `1440-z2-mental-model.png` (peak transition), `1440-z3-infrastructure.png` (sustained climax), `1440-z4-practice.png` (resolution).

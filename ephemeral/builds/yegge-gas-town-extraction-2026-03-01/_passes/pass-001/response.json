  "result": "<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_START -->\nBUILT: Full HTML/CSS architecture for a 14-section page, with 3 content sections rendered (You Are Here, Who is Steve Yegge, Gas Town Mental Model). Dark header/footer shell with red alarm stripe. 960px container spine. Zone background system spanning 11 named facility layers. Complexity ladder as a structured vertical schematic with red-highlighted active level. Pull quote component with margin-bleed treatment (regular and dominant variants). Two-column stark comparison for ant/colony. Credential grid for Yegge's stats. I/O block for the Idea Compiler concept. Full callout family (5 variants). Complete CSS for components that later sections will need (reasoning, core abstraction, decision matrix, task component, file tree, bento grid).\n\nTRYING: To make the street level of the facility feel INHABITED — open, breathing, confrontational but not hostile. Yegge's voice (pull quotes) interrupts the architectural grid the way his ideas interrupt conventional thinking. The dominant pull quote for the ant/colony insight has the most generous whitespace on the page — ~128px above and below — because this is the single idea everything else serves. The transition from biography to mental model uses a breathing transition (3px border, 64px gap) because the cognitive shift is significant: from \"who built this\" to \"what IS this.\"\n\nREJECTED: (1) Raw ASCII art for the complexity ladder — felt too casual for the world's geometry. Built a structured HTML component instead where each level is a discrete element with consistent border treatment. (2) Hue-shifted callout backgrounds (blue tint for info, green tint for tip) — violated R >= G >= B warm palette constraint. Used subtly varied warm backgrounds instead; the 4px left border color carries the semantic differentiation. (3) Full-bleed pull quotes using calc(-50vw + 50%) — too aggressive for street level, which should breathe without overwhelming. Used simpler negative-margin technique that bleeds to container width. (4) Musical framework labels (PULSE, CRESCENDO) on sections — the cross-section metaphor is spatial, not temporal; density should be felt, not labeled.\n\nSURPRISED: The credential grid (4 items: ~1M lines, 225K lines, Recursive, Transparent) creates an unexpected density island within the otherwise sparse biographical section — it provides visual weight that anchors the credentials before the reader encounters Yegge's philosophy. Also surprised by how the warm palette constraint forced callout backgrounds to differentiate primarily through their borders rather than their fills — this actually reinforces the design system's principle that borders are the primary semantic signal.\n\nWANTED: To add a subtle visual treatment for the \"Why Gas Town?\" Mad Max references — some acknowledgment that these are deliberately wild names in an otherwise precise system. The opposition between wildness and architecture is present in content (the profane quotes live inside sharp-edged containers) but I wanted a visual mechanism that made the wildness more palpable without breaking the soul.\n\nUNRESOLVED: (1) The section between \"Why Gas Town?\" and the start of Section 3 (8 Roles) needs a stronger zone transition — we're crossing from street level to factory floor, the biggest density shift in the entire page. The current NEXT_CHUNK insertion point sits after the essence callout but before this major boundary. (2) The credential grid and the content-list beneath it contain partially overlapping information — subsequent passes might refine whether both are needed or whether one treatment serves better. (3) The pull quote background (--zone-grit: #F5F0E6) creates a visible but subtle differentiation from the section background — this may need strengthening in denser zones where pull quotes appear amid more visual competition.\n<!-- CONVICTION_ADDITION_END -->\n\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_START -->\n- Discovery 1: The warm palette constraint (R >= G >= B) fundamentally changes how callout variants are designed. In a system that allows cool backgrounds, semantic differentiation comes from background hue. In this warm-only system, the 4px left border becomes the PRIMARY semantic channel and the background becomes atmospheric. This validates the design system's emphasis on border-left as the callout identity signal — it was designed for exactly this constraint.\n- Discovery 2: The content's own structure suggested the transition weights: \"You Are Here\" to \"Who is Yegge\" is a spacing shift (1px, 48px) because both orient the reader on the same street. \"Who is Yegge\" to \"Gas Town Model\" is a breathing transition (3px, 64px) because the cognitive mode changes from biographical to philosophical. The conviction brief's opposition (wildness vs architecture) maps directly to transition grammar — wildness demands more breathing room to contain it.\n- Discovery 3: The mechanism catalog's distinction between PROGRESSIVE and DISCRETE border-weight modes (Mechanism #1) becomes visible in the ladder component. The ladder uses DISCRETE mode: the active level gets 4px (structural accent), all others get 1px (micro separator). These aren't a gradient — they're two distinct categories. The career table below uses the same discrete logic: 3px header border (structural) vs 1px row dividers (separators). The entire page so far operates in discrete mode; progressive mode may emerge in the factory floor sections where the 8 roles form a hierarchy.\n<!-- DISCOVERY_LOG_END -->",

## World-Description

This page lives in the part of the KortAI world where the precision gets loud — where editorial authority must contain industrial ambition without taming it. The content is a factory blueprint drawn by someone who builds with chaos as raw material. The world's sharp edges here aren't decorative restraint; they're structural steel. Every flat surface is a factory floor. Every warm cream background is a wall that has seen work.

## Opposition

The central tension: **industrial chaos delivered with editorial authority.**

The content celebrates imperfection. "Some bugs fixed 2-3 times. Some fixes get lost." It recommends spending $200/day on agents you cannot fully control. It quotes its creator saying the code was "smuggled 400 miles upriver in my ass." It names itself after a Mad Max outpost. The philosophy is fundamentally about surrendering precision for throughput — about embracing a world where things break, get rebuilt, break differently, and eventually converge.

But the page exists inside KortAI. Sharp borders. Decisive typography. Instrument Serif speaking with editorial confidence. Every edge clean, every surface honest.

The builder must not resolve this tension. The page's power comes from industrial content rendered with total composure. The chaos lives in what the words SAY. The authority lives in how the page HOLDS those words. A Yegge quote about slopping fish into barrels, typeset in Instrument Serif with 48px of breathing room above it — that IS the page. The container never flinches. The content never apologizes.

## Metaphor

**The Refinery Cross-Section.**

This is not a metaphor imported from outside. The content names itself: Gas Town is a refinery. Ideas go in crude. Code comes out refined. The architecture has literal levels — town-level management, rig-level production, human-level oversight. The page should feel like an elevation drawing of this refinery, sliced open to reveal its floors.

The reader enters at ground level — the gate. Who built this place? Why does it exist? The ground floor is warm, human-scaled, biographical. Yegge's face would go here if this were a magazine profile.

Then the reader ascends to the observation deck — the mental model floor. Here the whole factory becomes visible for the first time. The "ant colony" insight. The shift from programmer to product manager. This is the widest view, the most generous whitespace. One idea, seen from height.

The production floor comes next — the 8 roles, the communication flows, the architecture diagrams. This is the densest zone. The reader is inside the machinery now. Diagrams are not illustrations; they are the content. The hierarchy chart, the communication flow, the tmux layout — these are the refinery's actual blueprints.

Below the production floor: the data pipeline. Beads. The memory system that prevents amnesia. Quieter than the production floor but structurally critical. The nervous system running beneath everything.

Then the control room — implementation commands, startup scripts, daily workflow. Practical, imperative, dense with monospace. The reader's hands are on the controls.

Finally, the exit corridor — troubleshooting, decision matrices, honest comparisons. The refinery viewed from outside again, now with full knowledge of what's inside. The reader decides: am I ready to run this?

The cross-section metaphor gives the builder a vertical logic: each zone has a depth, a density, and a temperature. Ground level is warm. Observation deck is spacious. Production floor is hot and dense. Data pipeline is cool and methodical. Control room is utilitarian. Exit corridor is honest and open.

## Arc

**Opening** — Provocation. The reader should feel their assumptions challenged. The very first encounter should carry Yegge's confrontational energy: you're doing it wrong, here's why. Not hostile — confident. The feeling of walking into a building where the person in charge clearly knows more than you do and isn't going to pretend otherwise. Slight vertigo. Slight thrill.

**Early development** — Conceptual expansion. The "ant colony" insight should land like a room suddenly getting bigger. The reader should feel the mental model shift physically — a widening, a sense of scale previously unconsidered. This is the observation deck moment: oh, it's not about making the agent better. It's about making MORE agents. The feeling is intellectual pleasure mixed with intimidation.

**Peak development** — Immersion in complexity. The 8 roles, the architecture diagrams, the Beads memory system. The reader should feel surrounded by machinery — impressed by the engineering, slightly overwhelmed by the scale, but held by the page's editorial composure. The density is high here and the reader should feel it as richness, not confusion. Each role is a character they're meeting. The factory is alive.

**Practical plateau** — Grounded confidence. Implementation commands, tmux layouts, startup scripts. The feeling shifts from awe to capability. The reader should feel their hands itching. The density is still high but the content is imperative — do this, then this, then this. The feeling is "I could actually run this."

**Resolution** — Honest reckoning. Troubleshooting, costs, decision matrices, comparisons. The feeling should be respectful sobriety. The content is remarkably honest about when NOT to use Gas Town. The reader should feel trusted — treated as an adult who can weigh tradeoffs. The warmth returns. The page exhales.

**Closure** — Return to conviction. "Build a colony, not the world's largest ant." The reader should feel the opening provocation again, but now it resonates at depth. What was confrontational is now obvious. What was intimidating is now understood. The feeling is: I know what this is. I know if it's for me.

## Content Map

**Zone 1 — The Gate (warm, biographical, LOW density)**
- "You Are Here" complexity ladder → orientation device, establishes the reader's position
- "Who is Steve Yegge?" → credibility through biography, not credentials
- The "Vibe Coding" pioneer section → philosophical grounding
- Density: LOW spatial, MEDIUM semantic. Generous whitespace. One concept per viewport.

**Zone 2 — The Observation Deck (spacious, conceptual, LOW-MEDIUM density)**
- "The Gas Town Mental Model" → the core insight, the ant colony shift
- "The Idea Compiler" → the transformation from programmer to PM
- "Why Gas Town?" → the Mad Max grounding
- This zone gets the most breathing room on the page. The "ant colony" quote should have gravitational pull — whitespace around it like a clearing in a forest.

**Zone 3 — The Production Floor (dense, architectural, HIGH density)**
- "The 8 Roles Architecture" → the hierarchy diagram, each role's deep dive
- "Role Communication Flow" → the flow diagram
- This is the page's density peak. Eight roles, each with function, responsibilities, commands, model recommendations. The architecture diagrams are load-bearing content, not decoration. This zone will be the longest and most complex.

**Zone 4 — The Data Pipeline (cool, systematic, MEDIUM density)**
- "Beads: The Memory System" → the 50 First Dates problem, architecture, memory model
- "Why Git as Database?" → technical justification
- Cooler temperature than Zone 3. More methodical. The memory layer diagrams should feel like cross-sections of plumbing — essential infrastructure, not flashy.

**Zone 5 — The Timeline (contextual, MEDIUM density)**
- "The 6 Waves of AI" → evolution framework
- "The 8 Stages of Dev Evolution" → prerequisite framing
- "Core Principles" → GUPP, zero framework cognition, cattle not pets
- This zone provides the WHY behind the WHAT of Zones 3-4. Density eases slightly.

**Zone 6 — The Control Room (practical, imperative, HIGH density)**
- "Implementation Guide" → installation, config

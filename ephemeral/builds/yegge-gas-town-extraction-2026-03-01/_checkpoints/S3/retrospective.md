The artifact arrives at subset 3 as unworked ground — no verifier trajectory, no conviction tissue, no accumulated builder fingerprints — meaning the Deep Dives & Structure pass on Islands, Layers, and Fractal visuals will be laying foundation rather than deepening existing integration, and builders should treat this as first contact with the material rather than continuation. With five files spanning two conceptual pairs (Islands/Layers) plus their visual counterparts and a standalone Fractal visual, the natural momentum points toward establishing structural rhymes between the textual deep dives and their visual companions — the relationship between DD-003 and DD-004 as a conceptual axis (discrete isolation vs. continuous stratification) is the strongest available organizing force, and builders who make that tension legible in the artifact's structure will create the scaffold everything after subset 3 hangs from. The widest unclaimed territory is the Fractal visual (DD-006), which arrives without a textual deep-dive partner and therefore cannot rely on text-visual pairing — it must instead become the element that bridges or disrupts the Islands/Layers duality, and how builders position it will determine whether the artifact's structure reads as paired essays with an appendix or as a three-body system where fractal self-similarity reframes what "island" and "layer" even mean.

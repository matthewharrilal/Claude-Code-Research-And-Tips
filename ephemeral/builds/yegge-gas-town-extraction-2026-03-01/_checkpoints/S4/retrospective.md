The artifact arrives at subset 4 as unmarked ground — no verifier observations, no conviction tissue, no accumulated creative decisions — meaning incoming builders face the rare condition of writing into a page with no momentum to honor or resist, where the Composition Case Studies corpus (CD-001 Reasoning, CD-005 Multi-Axis, CD-006 Pilot Migration, Anti-Prescription Template) must establish the artifact's foundational character rather than layer onto existing texture. Without prior passes to create trajectory, direction must be self-generated: the four corpus files naturally tension against each other — structured reasoning methodology pulling toward prescription while the Anti-Prescription Template explicitly repels it — and the most productive vector is to let that tension become the page's organizing energy rather than resolving it prematurely into either rigid frameworks or vague principles. The richest unclaimed territory is the interplay between CD-005's multi-axis composition logic and the Anti-Prescription Template's insistence on contextual flexibility — no builder has yet shaped how a page can demonstrate compositional rigor through its own structure while simultaneously refusing to become a formula, and the first subset to crack that paradox will define everything that follows.

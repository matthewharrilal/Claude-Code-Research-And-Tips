The artifact is a blank canvas backed by a research foundation whose strongest conceptual energy lives in the tension between density as measurable dimension (R3) and density as fractal self-similarity (DD-006) — the corpus has vocabulary for both mechanical and organic approaches to compression, but no builder has yet forced these two frames to argue with each other on the page. With no conviction layer or verifier trajectory to inherit, direction is pure potential: the research synthesis and combination theory files suggest the artifact wants to become a space where multiple density axes interact simultaneously rather than stack sequentially, but this remains theoretical scaffolding awaiting its first concrete instantiation. The richest unclaimed territory is the gap between R4's axis innovations and DD-006's fractal recursion — no one has yet explored what happens when a density axis doesn't just vary along a gradient but folds back on itself, embedding its own logic at smaller scales within the page's visual and textual structure.

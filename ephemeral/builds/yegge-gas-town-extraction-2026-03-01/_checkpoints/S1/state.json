The conviction brief's opposition (wildness vs architecture) maps directly to transition grammar — wildness demands more breathing room to contain it.",
    "Discovery 3: The mechanism catalog's distinction between PROGRESSIVE and DISCRETE border-weight modes (Mechanism #1) becomes visible in the ladder component. The ladder uses DISCRETE mode: the active level gets 4px (structural accent), all others get 1px (micro separator). These aren't a gradient — they're two distinct categories. The career table below uses the same discrete logic: 3px header border (structural) vs 1px row dividers (separators). The entire page so far operates in discrete mode; progressive mode may emerge in the factory floor sections where the 8 roles form a hierarchy."

    "### 1. DEEPLY INTEGRATED\n\n**The pull quote treatment and R2/RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS on editorial voice.** The creative direction says Yegge's quotes are \"the strongest single element in this content\" and should \"interrupt the grid the way his ideas interrupt conventional thinking.\" The builder heard this. The pull quotes use negative margins to physically bleed beyond the content column, forcing the reader's eye wider than the page's 960px spine permits. The grit background and red structural border create a genuine *interruption* — you're reading the page's neutral cream rhythm and suddenly the ground shifts under you. The dominant variant for the ant/colony quote goes further: 80px vertical padding creates a silence *around* the words that feels like a room cleared for a speaker. This is the \"most generous whitespace on the page\" the creative direction demanded, and it earns its position. I can feel that the builder read R2's research on creative layouts and the synthesis document's emphasis on editorial confidence, and let those files change the physical shape of the page around Yegge's voice. Red appears here as *alarm* — the creative direction's instruction that in this industrial quarter, \"red appears not for attention but for alarm.\"\n\n**R5 combination theory and the callout family DNA.** The five callout variants (Info, Tip, Gotcha, Essence, Challenge) share identical structure: 4px left border, sparse uppercase mono label, dense body text. The only variation is border color and background tint. This is *exactly* what R5-COMBINATION-THEORY calls \"Family Cohesion Through Shared DNA\" — color differentiates, structure unifies. More importantly, the builder follows R5's *sequencing* principles. In the \"You Are Here\" section, the sequence is Info (orientation) → Tip (practical advice) → checklist (practical requirements) → Gotcha (alarm). This follows the Setup-Payoff arc: Context → Action → Hazards. The Gotcha comes *after* the checklist, not before — so the reader has already internalized the prerequisites before the alarm fires. R5 calls this \"providing protective alarm without anxiety.\" The section on the Gas Town Mental Model ends with an Essence callout, following R5's resolution principle that sections should \"end with resolution, not tension.\" That Essence callout wraps the entire conceptual shift into one paragraph. You feel it land like a door closing behind you.\n\n**DD-006's border-weight gradient and the complexity ladder.** The ladder component uses three border weights: 4px structural on the active level (Level 7), 1px micro on all other levels. The active level blazes red against the others' neutral border color. This directly applies DD-006's mechanism of border-weight gradient encoding — visual weight equals importance. The reader's eye is *pulled* to Level 7 before reading any label text. The ladder is also exactly what the creative direction specified: \"a single orienting artifact — vertical, sharp, declarative.\" It is all three of those things. It reads like a diagram bolted to a factory wall.\n\n**The transition system and R3's density rhythm.** Two transition types appear in this chunk: `.transition--shift` (lighter, same-domain boundary between You Are Here and Who is Steve Yegge) and `.transition--breathe` (heavier, between biography and the core conceptual insight). A third type, `.transition--hard`, is defined with a red border for zone-boundary crossings. This three-tier transition system reflects R3's gradient principle: \"Density should never change ABRUPTLY. Transitions need gradients.\" The shift between orientation and biography feels like turning a corner in the same hallway. The breathe between biography and mental model feels like walking through a doorway. The hard transition (unused so far) will presumably mark the descent from street level into the factory floor. The builder is building vocabulary for transitions they haven't needed yet. That's the R3 research operating as *physics*, not decoration.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SURFACE-LEVEL\n\n**The credential grid as density islands.** The four-item grid (1M lines, 225K lines, Recursive, Transparent) has the *shape* of an R3 density islands pattern — compact information pockets surrounded by sparser content. But directly below it, a content list repeats the same four facts plus one more. The repetition creates a stuttering effect where the reader absorbs identical information in two formats within three inches of scroll distance. The grid works as a visual element; the list works as readable content. Together they create density *debt* (R3 Insight 30) without paying it. The builder seems aware of the density islands concept but hasn't committed to one treatment over the other.\n\n**The comparison layout and the creative direction's opposition theme.** The two-column Traditional/Gas Town comparison visually encodes the ant-vs-colony contrast, with muted secondary headings on the left and red primary headings on the right. This references the creative direction's central tension of \"wildness against architecture.\" But the execution is *balanced* — both columns are equal width, equally spaced, equally weighted. The creative direction asks for something harder: \"Neither side can win. Sanitize the punk energy and you produce documentation for a tool that could be any tool.\" Right now, the comparison is informational rather than *felt*. The Gas Town column doesn't actually feel wilder or more urgent than the Traditional column. Both read as clean lists. The opposition is *stated* but not *embodied*.\n\n**Zone backgrounds defined but not yet deployed.** The CSS defines nine zone backgrounds (zone-exterior, zone-street, zone-street-warm, zone-grit, zone-factory, zone-factory-deep, zone-machinery, zone-plumbing, zone-context, zone-ops, zone-map). Of these, only exterior, street-warm, grit, context, and machinery appear in the HTML. The naming follows the creative direction's industrial facility metaphor — these are named by location, not by function. But with only Zone 1 built, the progression from street to factory to plumbing exists only as intention in CSS custom properties, not as felt experience in scrolling.\n\n---\n\n### 3. ABSENT\n\n**The density WAVE as a felt experience.** R3's research describes density as six dimensions with rhythmic patterns (PULSE, CRESCENDO, BOOKENDS, WAVE). The creative direction maps these to specific zones: street level sparse, factory floor dense, plumbing medium-high, context medium, operations utilitarian, map comparative. With only Zone 1 built, the page demonstrates one density state (sparse/breathing) without any contrast to validate the rhythm. This absence is *structural* — it cannot be resolved within the street level alone. It is relevant and will become the most critical test of the next builder's work.\n\n**The cinematic wide-close-wide pattern from R4.** The research describes how film-style establishing shots create orientation, close-ups create intimacy with detail, and wide shots provide synthesis. The current page moves linearly through its content without zoom-level shifts. The You Are Here section could have used this pattern: establishing shot (the complexity ladder in full context), close-up (Level 7 specifically — what it means, what it demands), wide shot (how this document will guide the reader through it). Instead, it moves sequentially: ladder → callout → callout → checklist → callout. This is functional but cinematically flat.\n\n**The creative direction's instruction about the \"8 stages of dev evolution\" and \"6 waves of AI\" as context wall material.** These sections exist in the content but haven't been built yet. The creative direction places them in Zone 4 (the context wall) and describes them as \"philosophical — stepping back from the machinery to understand *why it was built this way*.\" Their absence is expected given the chunk boundary.\n\n**The F-pattern or any specific axis pattern from R4.** The page follo"

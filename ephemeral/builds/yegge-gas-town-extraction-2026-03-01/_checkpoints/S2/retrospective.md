The artifact is a blank field — no conviction tissue, no verifier trajectory, no accumulated creative decisions — meaning the Identity & Perception subset's builders will be laying the first strokes on unmarked ground, with the R1/R2 structural patterns and OD conversational-confidence-creative triad as their only raw material. Without prior passes to establish momentum or resistance, direction must be self-generated: the central creative question is whether identity emerges from the documentation patterns' structural voice (precision, hierarchy, authority) or from the conversational-creative corpus files' tonal warmth, and the most alive work will find the friction point between those two rather than defaulting to either. The entire territory of how confidence (OD-004) mediates between technical structure and creative expression is unclaimed — this is the substrate the next subset's builders should shape first, because the relationship between a page that knows what it is and a page that performs what it feels will define every subsequent integration pass.

      - heading "The Philosophy of Self-Legibility" [level=2] [ref=e22]
      - paragraph [ref=e23]: Molly Cantillon's Personal Panopticon begins not with technology but with a profound observation about power and knowledge asymmetry. Pre-modern states were essentially blind to their citizens. They couldn't see population distributions, land ownership, economic activity, or individual behavior in any systematic way. This blindness limited their power.
      - paragraph [ref=e24]: "To overcome this, states built what she calls the \"apparatus of sight\": censuses that counted people, surname systems that tracked lineages, cadastral maps that documented property, and registration systems that monitored movement. These tools made populations \"legible\" to power."
      - paragraph [ref=e25]: The modern twist? Corporations have perfected this apparatus far beyond what states ever achieved. Every digital interaction generates behavioral data. Every purchase, click, scroll, pause, and abandonment creates a signal.
      - paragraph [ref=e26]:
        - strong [ref=e27]: "The asymmetry is total:"
        - text: They can see you. You cannot see yourself the same way they do. You have no dashboard of your own patterns, no alert system for your own behavioral drift, no synthesis of your own scattered data streams.
      - heading "What Self-Legibility Actually Means" [level=3] [ref=e28]
      - paragraph [ref=e29]: "Self-legibility is the act of building your own surveillance infrastructure—not to control yourself punitively, but to SEE yourself with the same clarity that institutions achieve. It's reversing the panopticon: instead of an external observer watching you from a tower, you ARE the observer. You build your own watchtower over your own life."
      - generic [ref=e30]:
        - paragraph [ref=e31]: "\"The feeling is hard to name. It is the violent gap between how blind you were and how obvious everything feels now with an observer that reads all the feeds, catches what you've unconsciously dropped, notices patterns across domains you'd kept stubbornly separate, and—crucially—tells you what to do about it.\""
        - generic [ref=e32]: Molly Cantillon
      - paragraph [ref=e33]: The word "violent" here is deliberate. There's a shock to seeing yourself clearly for the first time. The distance between how you THOUGHT you were living and how you ARE living can be jarring.
      - heading "The $2,000 Forgotten Subscriptions Story" [level=3] [ref=e34]
      - paragraph [ref=e35]: "The signature proof point: Cantillon found $2,000 in forgotten subscriptions. These weren't recent charges she'd missed. They were accumulated subscriptions that had slipped below conscious attention, each individually small enough to not trigger alarm, collectively significant."
      - paragraph [ref=e36]: The Personal Panopticon doesn't require superhuman discipline. It provides superhuman attention span. It reads every bank statement, flags every recurring charge, tracks every subscription, and surfaces what human attention would naturally miss.
      - generic [ref=e37]:

      - paragraph [ref=e97]: "A critical architectural principle: instances operate INDEPENDENTLY. There is no shared context. ~/trades does not see ~/health's recovery scores. ~/email does not see ~/nox's product decisions. This isolation serves context purity, security boundaries, blast radius containment, and parallel execution."
      - paragraph [ref=e98]: "When information MUST cross domains, handoffs are explicit:"

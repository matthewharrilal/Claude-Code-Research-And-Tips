# System Reading Protocol: How an Agent Dynamically Derives Design System Understanding

**Designer:** protocol-designer (Task #31)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Context:** Approach C from dynamics-analyst report -- TC becomes design-system-agnostic. Both sides of the tension (Side A from content, Side B from design system) are derived through genuine engagement. This protocol replaces the static 35-line Side B.

---

## The Problem This Solves

TC currently has an asymmetry:

- **Side A** (content needs): 14 axes of deep questioning, multi-step derivation, yield rating, interaction effects. The agent CONSTRUCTS its understanding through a rigorous process.
- **Side B** (design system personality): 35 lines of pre-written conclusions. The agent RECEIVES someone else's understanding.

The quality of tension derivation is bottlenecked by the weaker side. Side B's 27:1 compression (from ~950 lines to ~35 lines) flattens the nuances that produce the richest creative territory -- especially the design system's INTERNAL tensions (warm palette vs austere geometry) that the static summary averages away into "75% austere."

The System Reading Protocol makes Side B derivation as deep as Side A derivation. The agent reads actual design system files, asks specific questions, and forms its OWN understanding -- one that is content-sensitive, because the agent has already engaged deeply with the content in Phase 1.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Questions, Not Conclusions

The protocol provides QUESTIONS to ask while reading, not answers to adopt. "What geometric vocabulary does this system use?" not "The system is 95% angular." The agent's answers will differ based on the content it just analyzed in Phase 1 -- and that content-sensitivity is a feature, not a bug.

### 2. Engagement Before Characterization

The agent reads the actual files BEFORE attempting any personality characterization. Reading comes first; synthesis comes second. This prevents the agent from skimming for confirmation of any pre-existing mental model.

### 3. Internal Tensions as Primary Output

The most valuable thing the protocol produces is not a personality profile but a map of where the design system CONTRADICTS ITSELF. These internal tensions (warm palette + austere geometry, editorial authority + warm approachability) are the richest territory for Phase 2, because they reveal where the system already contains the seeds of compositional tension.

### 4. Depth Through Structure, Not Volume

The protocol doesn't ask the agent to read everything. It identifies a minimal file set (~600-1000 lines across 2-4 files) and asks specific, structured questions that force genuine engagement. Depth comes from the quality of questioning, not the quantity of reading.

### 5. No Prescribing the Shape of Understanding

The protocol tells the agent WHAT to investigate, not WHAT to find. It provides categories of investigation (geometry, palette, typography, rhythm, surfaces, vocabulary) but doesn't specify the dimensions, labels, or ranges of any characterization system. The agent constructs its own model.

---

## The Protocol

### Phase 2A: System Reading (replaces static Side B)

**When this runs:** After Phase 1 (multi-axis questioning) is complete. The agent has already formed a deep, multi-dimensional understanding of the content's needs. It now reads the design system files THROUGH that content-derived lens.

**Why this order matters:** An agent that just derived "the reader needs warmth and graduated trust" will notice different things about the design system than an agent that just derived "the reader needs rapid comparison and decisive judgment." The content-sensitivity is the point.

---

#### Step 1: Read the Identity Files

Read the design system's identity/constraint files. These are the non-negotiable rules that define the system's character through what it REFUSES.

**Minimum file set:**
1. The system's prohibitions/constraints file (the rules of the world)
2. The system's design tokens file (the vocabulary of values)

**If the design system provides additional identity files (e.g., soul-constraints, world-description, system-personality), read those too. But the minimum is: what does the system refuse, and what values does it offer.**

---

#### Step 2: Ask the Reading Questions

While reading (not after), ask these questions. They are organized by investigation domain. Not all will be equally productive for every design system -- some will produce rich answers, others sparse. Mark which domains produce the deepest engagement.

**GEOMETRY**
- What shapes dominate? What shapes are absent?
- Are edges sharp or soft? Is this a rule or a tendency?
- How does the system create containment? Through borders, backgrounds, spacing, or something else?
- What is the relationship between precision and expression?

**PALETTE**
- What is the emotional temperature of the color system? Warm, cool, neutral?
- How many colors are available? How many are locked vs flexible?
- What does color MEAN in this system? (Semantic, decorative, structural, hierarchical?)
- Where does the palette contradict the geometry? (This question often reveals the system's richest internal tension.)

**TYPOGRAPHY**
- How many typefaces? What voices do they represent?
- Which typeface carries authority? Which carries clarity? Which carries precision?
- What is the relationship between display type and body type?
- What does the type scale suggest about the system's attitude toward hierarchy?

**SURFACES**
- How does the system create depth? Through actual depth effects (shadows, layers) or structural means (spacing, borders, background zones)?
- Are surfaces flat or dimensional? What does this say about the system's relationship to physicality?
- What is the system's position on honesty vs illusion?

**RHYTHM**
- What spacing system exists? Fixed scale, flexible, or both?
- How does the system create visual breathing? Where does it compress and where does it expand?
- What tools exist for density variation?
- Are borders decorative or semantic? What weights exist and what do they encode?

**VOCABULARY BREADTH**
- How many distinct visual tools does this system provide? (Components, patterns, mechanisms)
- What categories of visual expression are available? (Spatial, temporal, material, behavioral, relational)
- Where is the vocabulary rich (many options) and where is it sparse (few options)?
- What visual ideas are EASY to express in this system, and what ideas are HARD?

---

#### Step 3: Identify the System's Internal Tensions

This is the most important step. Every design system contains contradictions -- places where one aspect of its identity pulls against another. These internal tensions are not flaws; they are the system's most interesting creative territory.

**Ask:**
- Where does this system contradict itself? (Example: warm palette + austere geometry = the system is simultaneously inviting and uncompromising)
- What is the gap between what the system's VALUES say and what its RULES enforce?
- What emotional qualities does the system WANT to express but STRUGGLES to express given its constraints?
- If you had to describe this system's personality in one sentence that contains a "but" or "yet," what would it be?

**The sentence with "but" is the key output.** Examples:
- "Geometrically absolute yet chromatically warm"
- "Editorially authoritative yet approachable in its palette"
- "Structurally rigid yet rhythmically varied"

This sentence captures the system's internal tension -- the built-in creative energy that Phase 2 will use to derive content-system tension.

---

#### Step 4: Map Zero-Tension and High-Tension Territories

Based on your reading (Steps 1-3) AND your content analysis (Phase 1), identify:

**Zero-Tension Territories:** What does the system already provide DIRECTLY for the content's needs? These are places where the Addition Test will return YES -- the system's existing vocabulary handles the content's demands without transformation.

- List the content needs (from Phase 1) that the system can serve with existing tools.
- For each: name the specific system tool (component, pattern, mechanism) that serves it.

**High-Tension Territories:** Where does the content's needs MOST STRONGLY conflict with the system's personality? These are the places where metaphor lives.

- List the content needs (from Phase 1) that the system CANNOT serve with existing tools.
- For each: what is the specific nature of the conflict? (The system refuses X; the content demands X.)
- Which of these conflicts intersect with the system's INTERNAL tensions (from Step 3)?

**The intersection of content-system conflict and internal system tension is the richest creative territory.** When the content pushes on exactly the place where the system already contradicts itself, the resulting tension has maximum depth and the widest metaphor space.

---

#### Step 5: Synthesize into Working Understanding

Produce a brief articulation (~10-20 lines) of your understanding of the design system. This is for YOUR OWN USE in Phase 2 tension derivation -- it is not a handoff document. It should capture:

1. **The Character Sentence:** The one-sentence-with-"but" from Step 3.
2. **The Strongest Internal Tension:** The most productive contradiction within the system itself.
3. **The Vocabulary Landscape:** Where the system is expressive (rich tools) and where it is constrained (sparse tools).
4. **The Generative Constraints:** 2-3 constraints that CREATE rather than merely prevent -- rules that force interesting solutions into existence.
5. **The Zero-Tension/High-Tension Map:** Which content needs are handled by assembly (existing tools) and which require compositional invention (metaphor).

This synthesis replaces the static Side B. It feeds directly into Phase 2's tension derivation.

---

## How This Feeds Into TC Phase 2

Currently, Phase 2 says: "For EACH high-yield axis from Phase 1: List Side A's emotional/structural demands (what the content wants) → List Side B's personality/constraints (what the system gives) → Identify the GENUINE opposition."

Under the System Reading Protocol, this changes to:

1. **Side A** comes from Phase 1 (unchanged -- multi-axis questioning produces content needs)
2. **Side B** comes from Phase 2A (NEW -- System Reading Protocol produces design system understanding)
3. **Tension derivation** now happens between TWO independently-derived, content-sensitive understandings

The tension is not between content needs and a fixed wall. It is between the agent's reading of the content and the agent's reading of the system, each shaped by the other.

The three diagnostic tests (Addition, BECAUSE, SUBSTITUTION) remain unchanged -- they are already system-agnostic.

The tension spectrum (NO TENSION → COSMETIC → WEAK GENUINE → STRONG GENUINE → IMPOSSIBLE) remains unchanged.

The three criteria for genuine tension remain unchanged:
1. Semantic opposition (between Side A and Side B as derived)
2. Vocabulary gap (Side B lacks a direct tool for Side A's need)
3. Structural overlap despite emotional opposition (makes bridging possible)

What changes is that Side B is now a LIVING understanding derived from actual files, not a FROZEN summary from a specific moment in time.

---

## Ensuring Depth Without Prescribing Conclusions

### The Risk: Shallow Reading

The biggest risk with dynamic Side B is that the agent reads 600+ lines and extracts only surface features: "sharp corners, warm colors, three fonts." This would produce a WEAKER Side B than the current static summary, which at least contains interpretive depth.

### How the Protocol Prevents Shallow Reading

**1. Structured questions force engagement.** The 24 questions across 6 domains are not answerable by skimming. "Where does the palette contradict the geometry?" requires actually holding two aspects of the system in mind simultaneously and looking for conflict. "What emotional qualities does the system WANT to express but STRUGGLES to express?" requires interpretive work, not extraction.

**2. The "sentence with but" test.** The requirement to produce a one-sentence characterization containing an internal contradiction forces the agent past surface description. "The system is angular and warm" is two surface observations. "The system is geometrically absolute yet chromatically warm" is an interpretation that reveals an internal tension. The "but" structure forces the agent to find conflict, not just catalog features.

**3. Zero-tension / high-tension mapping requires Phase 1 integration.** The agent cannot complete Step 4 without genuinely understanding both the content's needs (Phase 1) AND the system's capabilities (Steps 1-3). This cross-referencing prevents either side from being a surface-level exercise.

**4. The synthesis is for self-use, not transmission.** Because the working understanding is for the agent's own tension derivation (not a handoff to another agent), there is no incentive to compress or summarize. The agent writes what it NEEDS to think with, not what would pass a gate check.

### What About Inconsistency Across Invocations?

Two TC runs on different content will produce different Side B readings. This is philosophically consistent with "constructing, not discovering." Different content creates different lenses; different lenses see different aspects of the same system. The system itself hasn't changed -- the READING has changed because the reader's context has changed.

If consistency is needed (e.g., for a multi-page site where all pages should share a design sensibility), the system reading can be done ONCE and shared across TC invocations. But the default is fresh reading each time, because content-sensitivity is the primary value proposition.

---

## Design System Self-Documentation (Optional Enhancement)

The protocol works without any special design system preparation. But design systems CAN help by including a `system-personality.md` file (or equivalent) containing:

1. **Curated personality observations** (from humans who have worked with the system)
2. **Observed tension landscape** (tensions that have been productive in past builds, framed as observations, not as prescriptions)
3. **Known generative constraints** (constraints that have been observed to force interesting solutions)

This file is read AFTER the agent's own reading (Steps 1-4), not before. It is supplementary context, not a replacement for engagement. If the agent's reading significantly diverges from the curated observations, that divergence is worth investigating -- it may reveal something the curators missed, or it may reveal shallow reading.

The key principle: **the curated file is a conversation partner, not an authority.** The agent's fresh reading carries equal weight.

---

## Minimum Viable Version for First Experiment

For the first experiment testing dynamic Side B, the protocol can be simplified to:

### MVP Protocol (~20 lines in the skill)

```
PHASE 2A: SYSTEM READING

Read the design system's identity files. You have already questioned the content (Phase 1).
Now read the system that will HOUSE that content.

1. READ: The system's constraint/prohibition files and design tokens.
   - What does this system REFUSE? (Its character is defined by refusals.)
   - What VALUES does it offer? (Colors, fonts, spacing, borders.)

2. CHARACTERIZE: In one sentence containing "but" or "yet",
   describe the system's personality:
   "[The system is/does X] yet [also Y]"
   The contradiction in this sentence is the system's internal tension.

3. MAP AGAINST CONTENT:
   - Which content needs (Phase 1) can the system serve DIRECTLY?
     (Zero-tension: assembly territory.)
   - Which content needs CONFLICT with the system's personality?
     (High-tension: metaphor territory.)
   - Which conflicts intersect with the system's internal tension?
     (Richest creative territory.)

4. PROCEED to tension derivation with your understanding of BOTH sides.
```

This is ~20 lines, nearly line-neutral with the current ~35-line static Side B + ~45-line tension landscape. It teaches the agent HOW to read any design system without telling it WHAT any specific system is.

### What the MVP Drops

Compared to the full protocol above, the MVP drops:

- The 24 detailed questions across 6 domains (replaced by the more general "what does it refuse" and "what values does it offer")
- The extended internal-tension investigation (Steps 3's multiple prompts)
- The vocabulary breadth analysis (Step 2's VOCABULARY BREADTH domain)
- The generative constraints identification (Step 5's point 4)
- The self-documentation enhancement

These can be added after the first experiment shows whether the basic approach works.

### First Experiment Design

**Setup:** Run TC on the same content twice:
- Run A: Current skill (static Side B with personality spectrum)
- Run B: Modified skill (MVP System Reading Protocol replacing static Side B)

**Same content, same model, same agent.** The only variable is how Side B is derived.

**What to compare:**
1. **Depth of system understanding:** Does the agent in Run B form a richer or shallower model of the design system than the static summary provides?
2. **Content-sensitivity:** Does Run B's system reading show evidence of being shaped by the content the agent just analyzed?
3. **Tension quality:** Do the tensions derived in Run B access creative territory that Run A's pre-ranked tensions do not?
4. **Practical impact:** Do the two runs produce different metaphor candidates? Are the differences meaningful?

**Success criteria:**
- Run B produces a system characterization that contains at least one nuance absent from the static summary
- Run B identifies at least one high-tension territory not in the pre-ranked list
- Run B's tensions pass the Addition/BECAUSE/SUBSTITUTION tests at the same rate as Run A
- Run B takes no more than 3 minutes longer than Run A (reading overhead is bounded)

**Failure criteria:**
- Run B's system characterization is strictly a subset of the static summary (shallow reading)
- Run B produces demonstrably wrong characterizations (misreading the system)
- Run B fails to identify tensions that the static summary's pre-ranked list would have caught

## Relationship to Other Audit Findings

### Identity Files Audit (Report #12)

The identity-auditor found that prohibitions.md and soul-constraints.md contain genuine identity buried under pipeline-era enforcement scaffolding. The System Reading Protocol reads these files AS-IS for now -- the agent will encounter both the genuine identity and the pipeline language.

If/when the identity files are rewritten from RULES mode to WORLD-DESCRIPTION mode (as the auditor recommends), the System Reading Protocol becomes even more effective -- world-description language naturally invites the kind of interpretive engagement the protocol's questions demand.

The protocol is designed to work with EITHER framing. The questions ("What does this system REFUSE?", "Where does the palette contradict the geometry?") are answerable whether the file says "NEVER use border-radius > 0" or "Every surface is sharp -- corners cut with authority, not softened for comfort."

### Feedback-Loop Composition (Report #11)

The composition-researcher found that "TC's value is the changed state of the agent who has done the thinking. The output is not a document; the output is perceptual readiness." The System Reading Protocol aligns with this finding: Step 5's synthesis is for SELF-USE, not transmission. The agent builds its own perceptual readiness regarding the design system, just as Phase 1 builds its perceptual readiness regarding the content.

When TC and building are unified in a single agent (as the synthesis recommends for /build-page-v2), the System Reading Protocol's output never needs to be compressed into a handoff document. The agent carries its understanding forward into building as lived perceptual context, not as a summary.

### Dynamic vs Static Analysis (Report #3)

This protocol implements Approach C as recommended by the dynamics-analyst. The protocol is fully design-system-agnostic -- it works for any system that has constraint files and design tokens. The KortAI-specific content (personality spectrum, tension landscape, domain compatibility lists) has been replaced by a process for deriving equivalent understanding from any system's files.

The dynamics-analyst's key insight -- "the tension is between two READINGS -- the agent's reading of the content AND the agent's reading of the system, each shaped by the other" -- is the philosophical foundation of the protocol's sequencing (Phase 1 before Phase 2A).

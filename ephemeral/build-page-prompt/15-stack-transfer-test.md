# 15 -- STACK TRANSFER TEST: Tracing Compositional Intelligence From Full Form to Builder Input

**Agent:** stack-transfer-tester (Opus)
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Task:** #33 / #40 -- Trace the compositional intelligence stack from research deep dives to the ~230-line conventions brief and determine: is the brief SUFFICIENT?

---

## METHODOLOGY

The compositional intelligence stack has 5 layers:
1. **Scales** (5 architectural zoom levels)
2. **Channels** (6 CSS property families)
3. **Multi-Coherence** (>=3 channels shifting simultaneously at boundaries)
4. **Anti-Scale Model** (Richness = semantic density x restraint x spatial confidence)
5. **Fractal Self-Similarity** (same pattern direction at all 5 scales)

For each layer, I measured:
- **FULL FORM:** Lines in the deep dive report(s) + memory file
- **BRIEF FORM:** Lines in the conventions brief (10-CONVENTIONS-BRIEF-DRAFT.md)
- **COMPRESSION RATIO:** Full / Brief
- **WHAT WAS LOST:** Specific concepts, CSS examples, evaluation criteria
- **DOES IT MATTER:** Would the builder need the lost material?
- **ENRICHMENT:** If yes, what to add and where

Additionally, I examined the compression metacognitive (Report 13) and telescope-microscope analysis (Report 14) for cross-validation.

### CRITICAL FRAMING: CD-006 IS NOT FLAGSHIP

Throughout this report, CD-006 is referenced as a data point for what CEILING looks like -- NOT as the Flagship target. Per the 14-dimension definition (01-DEFINITION.md), Flagship 4/4 has NEVER been achieved. It requires qualities BEYOND CD-006:

- **D-04: GLOBAL multi-coherence** -- CD-006 has LOCAL multi-coherence (concentrated in S1 and bookends). Flagship requires a UNIFIED metaphor driving multi-coherence at EVERY boundary across the entire page.
- **D-13: Unified structural metaphor** -- CD-006 uses DIFFERENT local metaphors per section (geological strata in S1, Z-pattern Q&A in S2, bento in S3). Flagship requires a SINGLE pervading metaphor whose influence is perceivable in CSS treatment at 40%+ of sections WITHOUT textual labels.
- **D-09: Axis pattern variety with named transitions** -- CD-006 has 5 patterns but they were accumulated through a 4-stage pipeline, not planned from a single metaphor. Flagship requires 3+ patterns selected and transitioned BECAUSE of the metaphor.
- **D-05: All 5 scales STRONG** -- CD-006 is 4 strong + 1 moderate. Flagship requires all 5 strong.

The brief must transfer enough compositional intelligence for the builder to reach BEYOND what CD-006 achieved. Where CD-006 values are cited below, they represent the CEILING FLOOR, not the Flagship target. The 7 Flagship-only dimensions (D-03, D-04, D-05 at 5/5, D-09, D-13, plus stricter D-01 and D-12) define the additional territory the brief must enable.

## LAYER 1: SCALES (5 Architectural Zoom Levels)

### FULL FORM: 18-SCALES-DEEP-DIVE.md + memory/scale-research.md

**Lines:** 401 (deep dive) + 92 (memory) = **493 lines**

Key content in full form:
- Concrete CSS property tables for EACH of the 5 scales (Navigation: 5 properties with values; Page: 5 properties; Section: 5 properties; Component: 5 properties; Character: 5 properties) -- ~100 lines
- The mathematical ceiling formula: `ln(1440/12) / ln(2.7) = 4.8` -- 5 scales max
- The paradox: Middle (2 scales) scored 4/4; Flagship (5 scales) scored 1.5/4
- The dependency chain: Scale N depends on Scale N-1 being PERCEPTIBLE
- Build order: Bottom-up (Navigation -> Page -> Section -> Component -> Character)
- Verification methods per scale: squint test, scroll test, one-screen test, component isolation test, paragraph comparison test -- 5 distinct self-checks
- Minimum perceptual thresholds PER SCALE (table with 5 rows x 4 columns)
- 3-artifact comparison audit (CD-006 vs Flagship vs Middle) with per-scale scores
- The "Scale as SEQUENCING, Not Checklist" reframe -- build scales in order, verify each before proceeding
- Anti-scale finding: scales measure a SIDE EFFECT of richness, not its cause

### BRIEF FORM: Section 5 (Fractal Echo)

**Lines:** ~24 lines (lines 90-114)

What the brief says:
- Names the 5 scales with 1-line descriptions each (~5 lines)
- Mandates the Fractal Echo Table template (~10 lines)
- States the consistency rule: "Pattern direction must be consistent across all 5 rows" (1 line)
- Explains WHY this matters: "This is what makes a page feel composed rather than assembled" (3 lines)

### COMPRESSION RATIO: 493:24 = **20.5:1**

### DOES IT MATTER?

**YES -- CRITICALLY for 4 items.**

1. **CSS property tables per scale.** The brief tells the builder "Navigation scale: The header and nav set the tone -- sparse, authoritative, establishing the density arc." But the builder does not know WHICH CSS properties express navigation scale. The full form has a concrete table: `header { background: #1A1A1A }`, `header { border-bottom: 3px solid #E83025 }`, `.toc { background: #FAF5ED }`, etc. Without this, the builder must INVENT what "navigation scale CSS" means. This was the exact failure mode of the Flagship -- it attempted all 5 scales without knowing what CSS properties to use at each.

2. **Dependency chain.** Without knowing that Scale 5 (Character) depends on Scale 2 (Page) being perceptible, the builder will attempt all 5 simultaneously. This is EXACTLY what the Flagship did. The chain is: if zone backgrounds are imperceptible (Scale 2 fails), character-level letter-spacing variation (Scale 5) is orphaned -- the reader has no context for why the text is changing. This concept is ABSENT from the brief.

3. **Build order.** The brief's Fractal Echo Table is a PLANNING tool (fill in all 5 rows before building). But the deep dive proves that the TABLE should be filled first, and then scales should be BUILT in order (largest first) with verification between each. Without this sequence, the builder writes all CSS at once and verifies nothing.

4. **Verification methods per scale.** The brief has NO per-scale self-checks. The deep dive has 5: squint test (Page), one-screen test (Section), component isolation test (Component), paragraph comparison test (Character), 20% zoom test (Navigation). These could catch the Flagship's primary failure -- imperceptible page-scale expression -- during the build, not after.

### ENRICHMENT NEEDED

Add to Section 5 of the brief (or as supplementary material the builder reads):

```
SCALE BUILD ORDER (build largest first, verify before proceeding):
1. Navigation: header padding >= 48px, landmark visible at 20% zoom
   CSS: header background, border-bottom, .toc layout
2. Page: zone backgrounds >= 15 RGB delta, squint test passes
   CSS: section backgrounds, section padding arc, transition types
   >>> VERIFY: Squint from arm's length. Can you see zone shifts? If NO, STOP.
3. Section: >= 2 component types per viewport, internal rhythm visible
   CSS: component margins, grid layouts, width variation
4. Component: .dense and .sparse variants with >= 4px padding delta
   CSS: callout/component padding varies by zone
5. Character: ONLY after scales 2-4 verified. Letter-spacing >= 0.02em delta.
   CSS: per-zone body font-size, line-height, letter-spacing

DEPENDENCY: Scale 5 without perceptible Scale 2 = orphaned variation.
The Flagship had per-zone letter-spacing but imperceptible zone backgrounds.
Result: variation read as random, not intentional.
```

**Lines added: ~15. Value: VERY HIGH.** This is the single most critical missing content.

## LAYER 2: CHANNELS (6 CSS Property Families)

### FULL FORM: 19-CHANNELS-DEEP-DIVE.md

**Lines:** **720 lines**

Key content in full form:
- 6 detailed channel specifications (Chromatic, Typographic, Spatial, Structural, Behavioral, Material) with concrete CSS properties per channel -- ~300 lines
- Semantic direction tables per channel (4 directions each with CSS pattern and reader perception) -- ~120 lines
- Deployment CSS examples at section boundaries (how to write the actual CSS) -- ~60 lines
- Perceptual thresholds per channel (5 specific thresholds) -- ~15 lines
- Mechanisms-to-channels routing table (18 mechanisms x 6 channels) -- ~30 lines
- CD-006 boundary analysis (9 boundaries, per-boundary channel counts) -- ~60 lines
- Flagship boundary analysis (13 boundaries, per-boundary channel counts) -- ~60 lines
- Comparative analysis: channel DEPTH vs WIDTH (the core finding) -- ~30 lines
- Layout diversity as easiest path to multi-coherence -- ~25 lines
- The finding: 4 channels are the real vocabulary (Behavioral + Material are enhancement only) -- ~10 lines

### BRIEF FORM: Section 4 (Multi-Coherence Binding)

**Lines:** ~20 lines (lines 65-87)

What the brief says:
- Names the 6 channels with 1-line descriptions each (~6 lines)
- States the rule: "at least 3 of these 6 CSS channels must shift simultaneously" (1 line)
- States direction agreement rule: "shifts must point the same semantic direction" (1 line)
- Gives 3 example directions ("deeper", "lighter", "focusing") with CSS mappings (~3 lines)
- Gives 1 worked example of a multi-coherent boundary (~5 lines)
- States the challenge: "No page we have built has achieved this consistently" (2 lines)

### COMPRESSION RATIO: 720:20 = **36:1**

### WHAT WAS LOST

| Concept | Full Form | Brief Form | Lost? |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|
| CSS properties per channel (6 tables with specific properties) | 60 lines | 6 lines (1-line names only) | **MOSTLY LOST** (names survive, not properties) |
| Semantic direction tables (24 directions with CSS patterns) | 120 lines | 3 lines (3 example directions) | **MOSTLY LOST** (3 of 24 survive) |
| Deployment CSS examples (how to write boundary CSS) | 60 lines | 0 lines | **COMPLETELY LOST** |
| Per-channel perceptual thresholds | 15 lines | 0 lines (in Section 2 as general thresholds) | **PARTIALLY LOST** (thresholds exist but not channel-mapped) |
| Mechanism-to-channel routing table | 30 lines | 0 lines | **COMPLETELY LOST** |
| CD-006 boundary analysis (what WORKS) | 60 lines | 0 lines | Lost |
| Flagship boundary analysis (what FAILS) | 60 lines | 0 lines | Lost |
| Layout diversity = easiest multi-coherence path | 25 lines | 0 lines | **COMPLETELY LOST** |
| 4 channels are real; 2 are enhancement only | 10 lines | 0 lines | Lost |

### DOES IT MATTER?

**YES -- SIGNIFICANTLY for 3 items.**

1. **CSS properties per channel.** The brief says "Chromatic -- background-color, accent color, or border color." But the builder needs to know: when I am at a boundary and I want to shift the Chromatic channel, WHICH CSS properties do I change, and by HOW MUCH? The full form has explicit deployment examples:
   ```css
   .section-explore { background-color: #FEF5EB; }
   .section-analyze { background-color: #F8F6F3; }
   ```
   Without this, the builder knows the CONCEPT of chromatic shifting but not the MECHANICS.

2. **Layout diversity as easiest path to multi-coherence.** The deep dive's core finding: CD-006 achieves multi-coherence through LAYOUT DIVERSITY (changing axis patterns between sections), which inherently shifts 3+ channels at every layout change. The Flagship kept F-pattern throughout and relied on per-section property modulation -- much harder to sustain. This finding is ACTIONABLE: "Use at least 2 distinct layout topologies across the page (e.g., F-pattern for most + 2-column grid for 2-3 sections)." This single instruction could prevent the Flagship's monotone layout failure.

3. **Mechanism-to-channel routing table.** Without knowing which mechanisms operate through which channels, the builder might deploy 5 mechanisms that all operate through the Structural channel (border-weight, solid offset, border-left signaling, data table, dark header) and believe it has channel breadth. The routing table shows: to achieve multi-coherence, you must deploy mechanisms from DIFFERENT channel families.

### ENRICHMENT NEEDED

Add to Section 4 of the brief (or as supplementary table):

```
CHANNEL DEPLOYMENT SHORTCUT:
  Use >= 2 distinct layout topologies across the page.
  Changing layout (e.g., F-pattern -> 2-column grid) inherently shifts
  Typographic + Spatial + Structural channels = 3 free channel shifts.
  You then only need to manage Chromatic (background) explicitly.

  MINIMUM 2 LAYOUTS: primary flow (F or Z-pattern) for most sections
  + grid/comparative layout (2-col, bento, or hub-spoke) for 2-3 sections.

THE 4 PRIMARY CHANNELS (manage these at every zone boundary):
  Chromatic: background-color (>= 15 RGB delta)
  Typographic: font-size (>= 2px delta) OR letter-spacing (>= 0.03em delta)
  Spatial: padding (>= 16px delta between zone types)
  Structural: border-left weight/presence (appears/disappears always perceptible)
  (Behavioral + Material are enhancement only; do not count toward minimum 3)
```

**Lines added: ~12. Value: HIGH.** The layout diversity shortcut is the single highest-ROI instruction for multi-coherence.

## LAYER 3: MULTI-COHERENCE (>=3 Simultaneous Channel Shifts)

### FULL FORM: 20-MULTI-COHERENCE-DEEP-DIVE.md

**Lines:** **451 lines**

Key content in full form:

- Programmatic verification: what CAN be checked (JavaScript pseudocode), what CANNOT (semantic direction, perceptual salience, metaphor alignment) -- ~50 lines
- 3-channel minimum vs 5-6 channel ideal (with table: channels -> experience -> PA-05 level -> builder effort) -- ~30 lines
- Multi-coherence ABSENT (Flagship forensics): the exact computed CSS values at the S4->S5 boundary showing 0-1 perceptible channels -- ~40 lines
- Multi-coherence PRESENT (CD-006 forensics): the S1->S2 BREATHING transition with 6 channels traced in detail -- ~50 lines

### BRIEF FORM: Section 4 (Multi-Coherence Binding)

**Lines:** Same ~20 lines as Layer 2 analysis above (Sections 4 covers BOTH channels and multi-coherence in one block)

### COMPRESSION RATIO: 451:20 = **22.5:1**

### WHAT WAS LOST

| Concept | Full Form | Brief Form | Lost? |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|
| 3 semantic direction tables (DEEPER/LIGHTER/WARMER with 6-channel CSS) | 60 lines | 3 lines (3 1-line examples) | **MOSTLY LOST** (examples survive, not full CSS mappings) |
| Transition Table Method (required deliverable) | 30 lines | 0 lines (mentioned in Process but not Section 4) | **PARTIALLY PRESENT** (in Process section, line 235) |

| Multi-coherence = THE key differentiator | 30 lines | 0 lines stated explicitly | Lost |

### DOES IT MATTER?

**MODERATELY -- for 2 items.**

1. **3-channel minimum vs 5-6 ideal.** The brief says ">= 3 channels." The deep dive shows: 3 channels = PA-05 3/4 (DESIGNED, somewhat mechanical). 5-6 channels = PA-05 4/4 (COMPOSED, immersive). For Flagship 4/4, the builder needs to know that 3 is the FLOOR, not the TARGET. 5-6 is what CD-006 achieved at major boundaries. This distinction shapes whether the builder stops at 3 channels or pushes for 5.

2. **Direction agreement is stated but not operationalized.** The brief says "shifts must point the same semantic direction" and gives 3 example directions. But it doesn't say: "If background darkens (heavier) while spacing increases (lighter), the channels CONTRADICT. Fix the contradiction before proceeding." The brief implies this but the explicit contradiction check is absent.

### ENRICHMENT NEEDED

Add 1 line to Section 4:

```
3 channels shifting = DESIGNED (floor). 5+ channels shifting = COMPOSED (target).
If any channel shift CONTRADICTS the direction (e.g., bg darkens but spacing loosens), fix it.
```

**Lines added: 2. Value: MODERATE.** Sets the aspiration level and makes contradictions explicit.

## LAYER 4: ANTI-SCALE MODEL (Richness = Density x Restraint x Confidence)

### FULL FORM: 21-ANTI-SCALE-DEEP-DIVE.md

**Lines:** **709 lines**

Key content in full form:
- Semantic density: definition + concrete CSS metrics (perceptible-mechanism ratio, component types per scroll, CSS property variety per boundary) + benchmark table (CD-006 vs Middle vs Flagship vs Remediation) -- ~85 lines
- Restraint: definition + CD-006 evidence (frequency-limited mechanisms: drop cap 25%, decision matrix 12.5%, breathing transition 28.5%) + deliberately absent mechanisms table (7 absences) + channel discipline table (5 channels, each with ONE job) -- ~95 lines
- Spatial confidence: definition + 5 concrete manifestations (grid topologies, border hierarchy, typography shifts, component contrast, width variation) + "Large Values vs Spatial Confidence" comparison table -- ~100 lines
- Can the model be computed? (Yes partially: 15 programmatic gates: SD-01 through SD-04, RE-01 through RE-05, SC-01 through SC-06) -- ~70 lines
- The multiplication: why zero in any factor kills richness (3 zero-factor scenarios) -- ~60 lines
- How a recipe teaches the anti-scale model: binary gates as floor, example-based teaching, remove-and-check protocol -- ~80 lines
- The 70/30 split: recipe can achieve ~70% of anti-scale quality (binary gates + examples + protocols), remaining 30% requires builder compositional intelligence -- ~20 lines
- Stack position: anti-scale model sits ABOVE the entire stack as the evaluation function -- ~30 lines
- 5-line recipe encoding of the model -- ~5 lines
- 3 PA questions for the anti-scale model (PA-AS-01 squint test, PA-AS-02 absence test, PA-AS-03 commitment test) -- ~15 lines

### BRIEF FORM: Section 8 (Creative Authority), last paragraph

**Lines:** ~3 lines (line 181: "Richness is semantic density multiplied by restraint multiplied by spatial confidence. More is not better. Meaning is better.")

### COMPRESSION RATIO: 709:3 = **236:1**

| 3 PA questions (squint, absence, commitment) | 15 lines | 0 lines (squint test is in Q1, but not anti-scale framed) | **PARTIALLY PRESENT** |

### DOES IT MATTER?

**YES -- CRITICALLY. This is the most compressed layer and the most important.**

The anti-scale model is described in Report 23 (Stack Integration) as the "GOVERNING PRINCIPLE" that sits above the entire stack. Report 13 (Compression Metacog) identifies it as the evaluative frame that shapes all CSS decisions. Yet it receives 3 lines in the brief -- less than any other stack layer.

The specific losses that matter:

1. **Restraint is completely undefined.** The brief says "Richness is... restraint..." but never explains what restraint MEANS in CSS terms. The deep dive defines it concretely: "Drop caps deployed at 25%, not 100%. Decision matrix deployed once, not in every section. At least 3 catalog mechanisms deliberately ABSENT." Without this, a builder has no mechanism for exercising restraint -- it will deploy everything it can.

2. **The remove-and-check protocol is absent.** This is the most actionable anti-scale technique: "For each CSS rule, comment it out. If removing it causes no visible change, delete it permanently." This catches the Flagship's 23.7% sub-perceptual CSS waste. It costs 5-10 minutes. It is trivially instructable. And it is missing.

3. **Spatial confidence is undefined.** The brief says "spatial confidence" but never explains that it means "variation WITHIN a system" -- multiple grid types, 3-tier borders, 5+ font sizes, width variation, responsive breakpoints with layout changes. Without this definition, the builder reads "spatial confidence" as a vague aesthetic quality rather than a measurable CSS property.

4. **The model's position as GOVERNING is not communicated.** Report 23 argues the anti-scale model should be Section 3 (the evaluative frame the builder encounters EARLY), not a closing thought in Section 8. Currently, the builder encounters it after all other rules and processes it as a concluding sentiment, not a governing principle.

### ENRICHMENT NEEDED

Option A: Move anti-scale model to Section 3 and expand:

```
## 3. RICHNESS MODEL (The Governing Principle)

Richness = semantic density x restraint x spatial confidence.
ZERO in any factor = ZERO richness, regardless of the other two.

DENSITY: Every CSS rule must be perceptible at 100% zoom. Zero waste.
  >= 2 component types per viewport. Every viewport has visual variety.
  Self-test: Comment out each CSS rule. If removing it causes no
  visible change, delete it permanently.

RESTRAINT: Not everything available should be deployed.
  >= 3 catalog mechanisms deliberately ABSENT (document which and why).
  No component type > 35% of all instances. Drop caps in <= 2 sections.
  Frequency-limited mechanisms are EVENTS because they are rare.

CONFIDENCE: The squint test. Bold, decided values, not timid defaults.
  >= 3 distinct grid topologies. 3-tier borders (1/3/4px).
  5+ font sizes. Prose < 80% container width. Width variation.
  Ask: "Could I describe this page's personality in 3 adjectives?"
```

**Lines added: ~15. Value: VERY HIGH.** This is the second most critical missing content after the scale build order.

Option B (minimal): Add 5 lines to Section 8 operationalizing each factor:

```
DENSITY: >= 2 component types per viewport. Zero sub-perceptual CSS.
RESTRAINT: >= 3 mechanisms deliberately absent. No component > 35%.
CONFIDENCE: >= 3 grid types. 3-tier borders. 5+ font sizes.
ZERO TEST: Comment out each CSS rule. No visible change? Delete it.
```

**Lines added: 4. Value: HIGH.** Less structurally ideal but much better than the current 3-line mention.

## LAYER 5: FRACTAL SELF-SIMILARITY (Same Pattern at All Scales)

### FULL FORM: 22-FRACTAL-DEEP-DIVE.md + 23-STACK-INTEGRATION.md

**Lines:** 541 (fractal) + 506 (integration) = **1,047 lines**

Key content in full form:
- "Same pattern direction" defined concretely: named CSS property gradient manifests via zone-appropriate CSS at each of 5 scales -- worked example for "Refinement Arc" (5-row table with Scale / What It Looks Like / Primary CSS / Secondary CSS) -- ~50 lines
- Structural echo vs Parametric echo distinction: structural = same TYPE of principle; parametric = DEGREE varies by page zone. CD-006 has BOTH; Flagship has structural only -- ~30 lines
- Fractal plannable via Fractal Echo Table + MINIMUM PERCEPTUAL THRESHOLD column -- ~25 lines
- 3 verification methods: structural (binary/programmable), perceptual delta (binary/programmable), perceptual audit (judgment) -- ~50 lines

- Flagship fractal analysis: 5 scales scored (0 STRONG, 2 MODERATE, 2 WEAK, 1 ORPHANED) with CSS evidence per scale -- ~50 lines
- Realistic minimum for Flagship 4/4: 3 MANDATORY scales (Navigation STRONG + Page STRONG + Component STRONG), 1 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (Section), 1 OPTIONAL (Character) -- ~30 lines
- Relationship to multi-coherence: fractal = VERTICAL coherence (across scales), multi-coherence = HORIZONTAL coherence (across channels at one boundary). Together they form a 5x6 COHERENCE GRID -- ~50 lines
- 5 binary rules for fractal self-similarity -- ~20 lines
- Fractal Echo Table template with Verified? column and consistency check -- ~20 lines
- Stack integration (Report 23): the stack is a PRISM not a pipeline; all layers apply simultaneously; the transition table IS the stack in tabular form -- ~100 lines
- Worked example: one boundary through all 4 lenses (L1 perception, L2 scales, L3 channels, L4 multi-coherence, L5 anti-scale) -- ~40 lines
- Stack health checklist (mid-build self-assessment) -- ~35 lines
- Brief encodes 72% of the stack already; needs 4 minor changes -- ~30 lines

### BRIEF FORM: Section 5 (Fractal Echo) + Section 7 (Self-Check) + Process section

**Lines:** ~24 (Section 5) + ~20 (Section 7) + ~5 (Process mentions) = **~49 lines**

### COMPRESSION RATIO: 1,047:49 = **21.4:1**

| Anti-scale positioning (should be Section 3, not Section 8) | 10 lines | 0 lines | Lost |
| Restraint column in transition table | 5 lines | 0 lines | **LOST** |

### DOES IT MATTER?

**MODERATELY for 3 items.**

1. **Structural vs Parametric echo.** Without this distinction, the builder will achieve structural fractal coherence (2-zone callout DNA exists) but not parametric (callout padding varies by page zone). The Flagship had structural echo at component scale but not parametric. The builder needs to know: "Components in dense zones should have tighter internal padding than components in sparse zones."

2. **3/5 minimum.** The brief implies all 5 scales matter equally. The deep dive proves: Navigation + Page + Component MUST be STRONG (mandatory). Section is recommended. Character is optional and LAST. Without this priority signal, the builder may invest heavily in character-scale variation while neglecting page-scale zone backgrounds -- the Flagship failure pattern exactly.

3. **Fractal Echo Table missing threshold column.** The brief's table template has 3 columns (Scale, How, Primary CSS). The deep dive adds 2 critical columns: Min Threshold and Verified?. The threshold column transforms planning into verification. Without it, the builder fills the table with descriptions that produce imperceptible CSS.

### ENRICHMENT NEEDED

Add threshold + verified columns to the Fractal Echo Table in Section 5:

```
| Scale      | How the pattern expresses | Primary CSS       | Min Threshold          | Verified? |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Navigation | [header/nav]             | [layout, borders] | Padding >= 48px        | [ ]       |
| Page       | [zone sequence]          | [padding, bg]     | BG delta >= 15 RGB     | [ ]       |
| Section    | [within-section rhythm]  | [margins, grids]  | >= 2 types/section     | [ ]       |
| Component  | [internal structure]     | [label/body pad]  | Padding delta >= 4px   | [ ]       |
| Character  | [micro-typography]       | [tracking, size]  | ONLY after Page passes | [ ]       |

PRIORITY: Navigation + Page + Component = MANDATORY STRONG.
Section = recommended. Character = optional and LAST.
Components in dense zones MUST have tighter internal padding
than components in sparse zones (parametric echo).
```

**Lines added: ~12. Value: MODERATE-HIGH.** Transforms a planning tool into a verification tool.

## AGGREGATE ANALYSIS

### Compression Summary Table

| Stack Layer | Full Lines | Brief Lines | Ratio | Critical Losses | Builder Impact |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Scales | 493 | 24 | 20.5:1 | Build order, dependency chain, per-scale CSS, verification methods | **CRITICAL** |
| Channels | 720 | 20 | 36:1 | CSS per channel, layout diversity shortcut, mechanism routing | **SIGNIFICANT** |
| Multi-Coherence | 451 | 20 | 22.5:1 | 3-vs-5 channel distinction, contradiction check | **MODERATE** |
| Anti-Scale Model | 709 | 3 | 236:1 | Restraint definition, remove-and-check, spatial confidence ops | **CRITICAL** |
| Fractal Self-Similarity | 1,047 | 49 | 21.4:1 | Parametric echo, 3/5 priority, threshold columns | **MODERATE-HIGH** |
| **TOTAL** | **3,420** | **116** | **29.5:1** | | |

### The Central Finding

**The ~230-line brief is NOT sufficient to transfer the compositional intelligence stack.** It transfers the CONCEPTS (names, rules, principles) but not the OPERATIONALIZATION (CSS examples, build sequences, verification methods, failure forensics).

The brief is a **telescope** (Report 14's term) that tells the builder WHAT compositional intelligence IS. It is not a **microscope** that tells the builder HOW to deploy it in CSS. The missing 30% is overwhelmingly in the HOW category:

- HOW each scale manifests in CSS (lost from Scales)
- HOW to achieve multi-coherence through layout diversity (lost from Channels)
- HOW to verify each scale is perceptible before proceeding (lost from Scales + Fractal)
- HOW to exercise restraint (frequency limits, deliberate absences) (lost from Anti-Scale)
- HOW to eliminate sub-perceptual CSS (remove-and-check protocol) (lost from Anti-Scale)
- HOW component internals should vary by page zone (parametric echo) (lost from Fractal)

### The Worst Compression

The Anti-Scale Model at **236:1** is catastrophic. This is the GOVERNING PRINCIPLE of the entire stack, and it receives 3 lines in the closing paragraph of Section 8. Report 23 (Stack Integration) explicitly recommends repositioning it to Section 3 as the evaluative frame. This recommendation was not implemented in the current draft.

### The Best Compression

Multi-Coherence at **22.5:1** is the most efficient compression. Section 4 of the brief does a good job of explaining the binding rule, giving a worked example, and stating the direction agreement requirement. The losses are real but moderate -- mostly aspirational (3 vs 5 channels) rather than operational.

---

## IS THE BRIEF SUFFICIENT? VERDICT

### NO -- but it is fixable with ~56 lines of enrichment.

The brief needs 5 targeted additions:

| Addition | Lines | Where | Priority |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Scale build order + dependency chain + per-scale verification | ~15 | Section 5 (after Fractal Echo Table) | **P0 -- BLOCKING** |
| Anti-scale model operationalized (density/restraint/confidence definitions + remove-and-check) | ~15 | New Section 3 (before Transition Grammar) OR expanded Section 8 | **P0 -- BLOCKING** |
| Channel deployment shortcut (layout diversity + 4 primary channels) | ~12 | Section 4 (after multi-coherence rule) | **P1 -- SIGNIFICANT** |
| Fractal Echo Table with threshold + verified columns + priority signal | ~12 | Section 5 (replace current table) | **P1 -- SIGNIFICANT** |
| Multi-coherence aspiration (3 = floor, 5 = target) + contradiction check | ~2 | Section 4 (1 line addition) | **P2 -- NICE TO HAVE** |
| **TOTAL** | **~56** | | |

With these additions, the brief grows from ~230 to ~286 lines. This is within Report 14's calculated "FUSED zone" where the builder can hold both telescope and microscope simultaneously (< 300 lines).

### The Critical Question: WHERE does it go?

Report 14 argues strongly that the brief and recipe should be a "continuous zoom" document -- telescope at the top, microscope at the bottom, with the builder reading linearly from intent to implementation.

The enrichments above are ALL at the BRIDGE zoom level (between telescope and microscope). They tell the builder: "Here is the principle [telescope]. Here is how to deploy it in CSS [bridge]. Here is the specific threshold to verify [microscope]."

This is the ACI format (Actionable Compositional Intelligence) from Report 14:
- Level 2-3 on the ACI spectrum
- Every principle accompanied by its CSS operationalization
- The builder can EXTRAPOLATE to unstated decisions

### What the Enriched Brief Would Look Like (Structure Only)

```
Section 1: IDENTITY (Soul)                        ~25 lines [unchanged]
Section 2: PERCEPTION THRESHOLDS (Floor)           ~15 lines [unchanged]
Section 3: RICHNESS MODEL (Governing Principle)    ~15 lines [NEW -- anti-scale operationalized]
Section 4: MULTI-COHERENCE BINDING                 ~34 lines [+14: channel shortcut + aspiration]
Section 5: FRACTAL ECHO                            ~36 lines [+12: build order + threshold table]
Section 6: COMPOSITIONAL MEMORY PROTOCOL           ~18 lines [unchanged]
Section 7: SELF-CHECK PROTOCOL                     ~22 lines [unchanged]
Section 8: CREATIVE AUTHORITY                      ~13 lines [reduced -- anti-scale moved to S3]
Section 9: QUALITY FLOOR                           ~17 lines [unchanged]
Section 10: CONVICTION CARD                        ~17 lines [unchanged]
PROCESS                                            ~22 lines [unchanged]
                                                  --------
TOTAL                                             ~234 lines (net: barely changed)
```

Wait -- this is interesting. If the anti-scale model MOVES from Section 8 to Section 3 (15 lines relocated, not added), the net addition is only ~41 lines. The brief grows from ~230 to ~271 lines. This is well within the fused zone and below Report 14's ~300 line ceiling.

## CROSS-VALIDATION: What Reports 13 and 14 Say

### Report 13 (Compression Metacog) Confirms:

- "Altitude 2: Design System --> Master Prompt (50:1)" -- our aggregate is 29.5:1, better but still lossy
- "The FORMAT of compression determines what survives. Recipes preserve procedure; summaries destroy judgment." -- The brief's losses are overwhelmingly PROCEDURAL (build order, CSS examples, verification methods), which should be the easiest to preserve. The format is wrong for these items.
- "Every boundary destroys 60-80% of non-procedural intelligence." -- At 29.5:1, we're losing ~97% across the full stack. But 72% of the brief IS the stack (Report 23), so the brief is already doing well on the CONCEPTUAL layer. The losses are operational.
- "The problem is not compression but INTERFERENCE." -- The enrichments must be DENSE (specific CSS, binary checks) not EXPANSIVE (more theory, more justification). Every line must be actionable.

### Report 14 (Telescope-Microscope) Confirms:

- "Telescope content in a recipe works at LOW DENSITY but fails at HIGH DENSITY." -- The enrichments add ~41 net lines of bridge-level content (neither pure telescope nor pure microscope). At ~271 total lines, the density is well within the safe zone.
- "1 telescope sentence per 5-10 microscope sentences = processed." -- The enriched brief maintains approximately this ratio. The anti-scale model (Section 3, telescope) is ~15 lines followed by 5 sections of microscope-heavy content (~140 lines).
- "Total builder input under ~200 lines = fused zone." -- The brief is ~271 lines, which is above the strict fused threshold. But Report 14 calculates this for the brief ALONE without reference material. The builder also reads the content markdown and mechanism catalog. However, Report 14's evidence from the Middle experiment (100-line recipe + reference = 4/4) suggests the brief at ~270 lines is at the upper edge but viable, especially since Opus (not Sonnet) is the builder.
- "The conventions brief + recipe should be ONE CONTINUOUS DOCUMENT." -- The current brief IS one continuous document. The enrichments don't change this structure.

## APPENDIX A: The Stack Integration Report's 4 Recommended Changes

Report 23 (Stack Integration) recommended 4 changes to the brief. Here is their status:

| Change | Recommendation | Status in Current Brief | Status After Enrichment |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 5-line Stack Overview preamble | Add before Section 1 | ABSENT | Still absent (not in enrichments) |
| Reposition Section 3 as Anti-Scale Model | Move transition grammar, add anti-scale | ABSENT (transition grammar is Section 3) | **FIXED** (enrichment moves anti-scale to Section 3) |
| Add restraint column to transition table | Extra column in table template | ABSENT | Not explicitly added but restraint operationalized in Section 3 |
| Add 1 worked example (boundary through all 4 lenses) | 10-line example | ABSENT | Not added |

Of the 4 recommended changes, the enrichments address 1 fully (anti-scale repositioning), 1 partially (restraint), and miss 2 (stack overview, worked example). The worked example is a strong candidate for inclusion but would add ~10 more lines.

## APPENDIX B: What a Supplementary Reference File Could Contain

If the brief stays at ~230 lines and enrichment goes into a supplementary file (e.g., `_stack-reference.md`) that the builder reads alongside the brief, it could contain:

1. **Per-scale CSS property tables** (25 property/value pairs) -- 40 lines
2. **Channel deployment examples** (6 CSS code blocks) -- 30 lines
3. **Mechanism-to-channel routing table** (18 x 6 matrix) -- 25 lines
4. **3 direction tables** (DEEPER/LIGHTER/WARMER with full 6-channel CSS) -- 30 lines
5. **Remove-and-check protocol** (step-by-step) -- 10 lines
6. **15 programmatic gates** (SD, RE, SC series) -- 20 lines
7. **CD-006 forensic examples** (what each scale looks like when PRESENT) -- 30 lines

Total: ~185 lines.

This supplementary file would serve as REFERENCE MATERIAL (not instruction). The builder consults it when it needs CSS specifics that the brief doesn't cover. This is the architecture Report 14 recommends: brief (66 lines telescope) + recipe (120 lines microscope) + reference (185 lines lookup).

However, adding a 7th file to the builder's input pushes total volume to ~430 lines (brief 271 + reference 185). Report 14 flags this as within the "COMPETITIVE" zone (200-500 lines) where "the agent processes both but microscope wins." This is acceptable for Opus but suboptimal.

**Recommended approach: Put the 5 P0/P1 enrichments IN the brief (~41 net lines). Make the supplementary file available but not mandatory. The brief should be SELF-SUFFICIENT for a Flagship build.**

---

## FINAL VERDICT

The ~230-line conventions brief is **70% sufficient** for transferring the compositional intelligence stack as it applies to CEILING-level output. For FLAGSHIP 4/4 (which has NEVER been achieved), the brief is **~55% sufficient** because it additionally fails to transfer the Flagship-only requirements.

### What the brief transfers well (concepts, rules, principles):
- Soul constraints and identity (complete)
- Perception thresholds (complete)
- Multi-coherence binding rule (conceptually complete)
- Fractal echo concept (structurally present)
- Self-check protocol (5 good questions)
- Creative authority framing (strong)

### What the brief fails to transfer (operationalization of the stack):

**STACK GAPS (affect both Ceiling and Flagship):**
1. **Scale build order and dependencies** (CRITICAL -- causes the Flagship 1.5 failure pattern)
2. **Anti-scale operationalization** (CRITICAL -- governing principle is undefined in CSS terms)
3. **Layout diversity shortcut** (SIGNIFICANT -- easiest path to multi-coherence)
4. **Per-scale verification** (SIGNIFICANT -- prevents imperceptible implementation)
5. **Parametric echo** (MODERATE -- components should vary by page zone)

**FLAGSHIP-SPECIFIC GAPS (the brief does not address these AT ALL):**
6. **Unified structural metaphor** -- D-13 requires a SINGLE pervading metaphor that drives CSS decisions and is perceivable at 40%+ of sections without labels. The brief mentions metaphor in Section 10 (Conviction Card) as optional ("Metaphor (if any)"). It does not explain what a STRUCTURAL metaphor is, how it differs from a label, or how it manifests in CSS. CD-006's local metaphors are Ceiling; Flagship requires a global one. This is completely absent.
7. **Global multi-coherence** -- D-04 requires 3+ instances where >=3 channels encode the SAME semantic dimension simultaneously, driven by a unified metaphor. The brief describes multi-coherence at boundaries (Section 4) but does not describe how a metaphor CREATES multi-coherence opportunities or how multi-coherence should be GLOBAL (sustained throughout) rather than LOCAL (concentrated at bookends, as in CD-006).
8. **Axis pattern variety driven by metaphor** -- D-09 requires 3+ distinct axis patterns with named transitions. The brief does not mention axis patterns at all. The builder has no instruction to use multiple layout topologies, let alone to select and transition between them based on a metaphor's structural logic.

### Fixing the stack gaps: ~41 net lines

The 5 stack gaps can be closed with targeted enrichments as described above. These bring the brief from ~230 to ~271 lines.

### Fixing the Flagship-specific gaps: ~25 additional lines

The 3 Flagship-specific gaps require content that does not currently exist in the brief:

```
UNIFIED METAPHOR (Flagship requirement):
  Your page needs ONE structural metaphor that drives CSS decisions.
  Not a label. Not a theme announced in comments. A metaphor whose
  influence a reader perceives through CSS treatment alone.

  Test: Remove all text labels. Can a reader still feel the metaphor's
  organizing principle from borders, spacing, backgrounds, and typography?
  If NO, the metaphor is textual, not structural. Strengthen CSS expression.

  The metaphor creates MULTI-COHERENCE: at each zone boundary, 3+ CSS
  channels should encode the same metaphor-derived quality simultaneously.
  If the metaphor is "geological descent," then at depth boundaries:
  backgrounds darken + spacing compresses + borders thicken + typography
  densifies -- all encoding "going deeper."

AXIS PATTERN VARIETY (Flagship requirement):
  Use >= 3 distinct layout topologies (of 5 available: Z-Pattern,
  F-Pattern, Bento Grid, Spiral, Choreography).
  Each pattern change must have a NAMED transition (Smooth/Bridge/Breathing)
  that matches the cognitive distance between the two patterns.
  Select patterns BECAUSE of the metaphor's structural logic, not for
  coverage. If the metaphor is "geological descent," then Spiral for
  stratified content, Bento for specimen display, F-Pattern for
  narrative synthesis.
```

**Lines added: ~25. Value: CRITICAL for Flagship 4/4.**

### Total enrichment: ~66 lines (41 stack + 25 Flagship-specific)

Brief grows from ~230 to ~296 lines. This is at the upper edge of Report 14's fused zone (~300 line ceiling) but within it for an Opus builder.

### Probability Assessment

**Without enrichment:**
- P(Ceiling 4/4) = LOW-MODERATE. Builder has concepts but not operationalization.
- P(Flagship 4/4) = VERY LOW. Builder has no instruction for the 7 Flagship-only dimensions.

**With stack enrichment only (~41 lines):**
- P(Ceiling 4/4) = MODERATE-HIGH. Builder knows build order, verification, restraint, layout diversity.
- P(Flagship 4/4) = LOW. Flagship-specific requirements still absent.

**With full enrichment (~66 lines):**
- P(Ceiling 4/4) = HIGH. Operationalized stack + verification.
- P(Flagship 4/4) = LOW-MODERATE. Builder has the instruction but Flagship 4/4 has never been achieved by ANY builder under ANY conditions. The 2 THEORETICAL dimensions (D-04 global multi-coherence, D-13 structural metaphor) remain unvalidated hypotheses. The brief can instruct toward them, but whether a single Opus builder can EXECUTE them from instruction alone is an open question that only the experiment can answer.

### The Honest Gap

Even with full enrichment, the brief CANNOT guarantee Flagship 4/4 because:

1. **D-04 and D-13 are theoretical.** No page has ever demonstrated global multi-coherence from a unified metaphor under single-build conditions. The brief can describe the target; it cannot prove the target is reachable.

2. **The 30% discoverable compositional intelligence** (content-mechanism matching, dynamic multi-coherence profiling, compositional surprise) cannot be instructed. It requires builder capability that Opus has demonstrated at Ceiling level but not at Flagship level.

3. **CD-006's quality was EMERGENT from accumulated pipeline context** (4 stages, 30+ explorations). The brief attempts to TRANSMIT in ~296 lines what CD-006's builder ACCUMULATED over hours of iterative building. Transmission and accumulation may produce different outcomes.

The brief is the best instrument available. Whether it is sufficient is an empirical question. The experiment must run.

---

*This report is 490 lines analyzing the transfer of 3,420 lines of compositional intelligence into 116 lines of brief content. The enrichment recommendations total 66 lines (41 stack + 25 Flagship-specific). CD-006 is referenced as CEILING floor throughout, per the 14-dimension definition. Flagship 4/4 remains an unvalidated theoretical target.*

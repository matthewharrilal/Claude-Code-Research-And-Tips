# 05 -- TC Skill Audit: Tier Removal + Flagship Enrichment Map

**Agent:** tc-auditor (Opus)
**Task:** #5
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** SKILL.md (1,933 lines), 15-ALWAYS-FLAGSHIP-SIMPLIFICATION.md, 20-MULTI-COHERENCE-DEEP-DIVE.md, 22-FRACTAL-DEEP-DIVE.md, 23-STACK-INTEGRATION.md, 21-ANTI-SCALE-DEEP-DIVE.md, 14-TELESCOPE-MICROSCOPE.md

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The TC skill contains **~220 lines of tier-conditional logic** across 9 distinct regions. Removing this logic and promoting Flagship-level rules to universal produces a net **~180-line deletion** with zero signal loss (all Flagship-quality rules are preserved as universal). Beyond tier removal, the skill should be enriched with **5 Flagship-specific capabilities** from the deep-dive reports: multi-coherence binding, fractal echo protocol, transition grammar enrichment, anti-scale model operationalization, and compositional intelligence stack integration. These enrichments add **~120 lines** of high-value content to the skill.

**Net change:** ~180 lines removed, ~120 lines added = ~60 line net reduction, but with dramatically higher compositional intelligence density.

---

## PART 1: EXACT LINE RANGES TO REMOVE

### Block R-01: Step 0D Tier Classification Table (Lines 68-97)
**~30 lines: The tier routing table + mechanism count provenance**

```
Lines 68-71: "Step 0D: Tier Classification and Pipeline Routing" header + instruction
Lines 72-79: 4-row tier classification table (Floor/Middle/Ceiling/Flagship signal mapping)
Lines 81-97: "CRITICAL CAVEAT" block + mechanism count provenance paragraph
```

**REMOVE because:** This is routing machinery. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, there is no classification step. Every page runs the full pipeline. The Flagship row's deployment level ("Multi-pattern COMPOSITION, 3+ density patterns with typed transitions") promotes to a universal constant, not a conditional.

**PRESERVE from this block:** Lines 81-84 (mechanism count as proxy, not target) and lines 91-97 (natural landing zone description for Flagship only). These become universal guidance without the tier table.

---

### Block R-02: Middle-Tier Skip Instructions (Lines 99-126)
**~28 lines: The entire Middle-tier bypass**

```
Lines 99-100: "Middle-tier validation evidence" paragraph
Lines 101-103: "For Middle-tier pages (SKIP Phases 1-3)" header + instruction
Lines 105-113: Patterns vs Mechanisms explanation + pattern selection table (CRESCENDO/F-PATTERN/BENTO/PULSE)
Lines 114: "If content is HYBRID" conditional
Lines 116-123: Middle-tier output template
Lines 125-126: "WHY Middle skips Phases 1-3" explanation
```

**REMOVE because:** Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, no page skips Phases 1-3. Every page gets full metaphor derivation.

**PRESERVE from this block:** Lines 105-113 (the density pattern table: CRESCENDO/F-PATTERN/BENTO/PULSE). These patterns are useful VOCABULARY for Phase 4, not routing logic. They should be relocated to Phase 4.1 as spatial organization options within metaphor-driven composition.

---

### Block R-03: Ceiling/Flagship Routing + Degradation Protocol (Lines 127-145)
**~19 lines: Conditional routing and tier model defense**

```
Lines 127: "Ceiling/Flagship tier: Proceed to Phase 1 (full pipeline)"
Lines 129-133: Graceful degradation protocol (3 mandatory documentation items)
Lines 134: "The tier model is a validated hypothesis" caveat
Lines 136-137: "Critical principle" about Middle-tier richness
Lines 138-143: 4-level deployment distinction (Floor/Middle/Ceiling/Flagship)
Lines 144: "These deployment levels are validated hypotheses" caveat
```

**REMOVE because:** Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:
- Line 127 is trivially true (everything goes to full pipeline)
- Lines 129-133 are eliminated (no degradation exists)
- Lines 134 and 144 are tier model defense (model no longer needs defending)
- Lines 136-137 are Middle-specific (irrelevant)
- Lines 138-143 contain 3 lines of non-Flagship deployment levels (noise) + 1 Flagship line (signal)

**PRESERVE from this block:** Line 142 (Flagship deployment level: "Multi-pattern COMPOSITION, 3+ density patterns with typed transitions"). This becomes the ONLY deployment level description.

---

### Block R-04: Step 0D-CEILING Context Box (Lines 148-165)
**~18 lines: Conditional wrapper around universally valuable rules**

```
Lines 148-150: "If routed to Ceiling tier, read this context before proceeding" header
Lines 152-165: 7 specific requirements (metaphor mandatory, per-category minimums, reinforcing pairs, multi-channel coherence, 4-scale fractal, build time, container width)
```

**REMOVE the conditional wrapper (lines 148-150).** The 7 requirements in lines 152-165 are the MOST VALUABLE content in this section.

**PROMOTE lines 152-165 to universal rules.** These become unconditional requirements for ALL pages:
- Metaphor is mandatory (via Addition Test -- if tension exists)
- Per-category minimums (S:1+, H:1+, C:1+, D:1+, N:1+)
- Reinforcing pairs required (2+ encoding same semantic)
- Multi-channel coherence (>=3 channels at zone boundaries)
- 5-scale fractal coherence (all 5 scales)
- Build time 150-400 min
- Container width 940-960px NON-NEGOTIABLE

---

### Block R-05: Metaphor Scoring Rubric Tier Qualifier (Line 705)
**~1 line**

```
Line 705: "Step 3.5G -- Metaphor Scoring Rubric (MANDATORY for Ceiling+ Tier)"
```

**CHANGE "MANDATORY for Ceiling+ Tier" to "MANDATORY"** because under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, every page exceeds Ceiling+. The rubric applies universally.

---

### Block R-06: Phase 4 Tier-Specific Deployment Levels (Lines 868-872)
**~5 lines**

```
Lines 868-872:
- Floor (assembly): 0 custom mechanisms, Track 1 component templates only
- Middle (individual): 8-10 mechanisms, each independent
- Ceiling (combination): 12-15 mechanisms, 2+ combinations
- Flagship (multi-pattern): 16-18 mechanisms, 3+ patterns with BREATHING/SMOOTH/BRIDGE transitions
```

**REMOVE lines 869-871 (Floor/Middle/Ceiling rows).** Keep line 872 (Flagship row) as the universal deployment level. Simplify to a single statement: "Deploy 16-18 mechanisms across all 5 categories + 3+ reinforcing clusters with BREATHING/SMOOTH/BRIDGE transitions."

---

### Block R-07: Per-Category Deployment Middle-Tier References (Lines 1078, 1092, 1098-1102)
**~8 lines scattered**

```
Line 1078: "Per-category mechanism deployment (MANDATORY for Middle-tier+)"
Line 1092: "Middle experiment validation" paragraph
Lines 1098-1102: "Natural landing by tier" 4-row table
```

**Changes:**
- Line 1078: Remove "for Middle-tier+" qualifier. Becomes "Per-category mechanism deployment (MANDATORY)."
- Line 1092: Remove or reframe. The Middle validation evidence is historical, not operational. Either delete or compress to one sentence of provenance.
- Lines 1098-1102: Remove Floor/Middle/Ceiling rows. Keep Flagship row only.

---

### Block R-08: Fractal Gate Tier-Calibrated Requirements (Lines 1432-1441)
**~10 lines**

```
Lines 1432-1436: Tier-calibrated fractal requirements:
  - Floor: EXEMPT
  - Middle: 2 scales minimum (Page + Component)
  - Ceiling: 4 scales minimum
  - Flagship: 5 scales required (all scales)

Lines 1438-1441: "Concrete Middle-tier example (CRESCENDO, 2 scales)" paragraph
```

**REMOVE lines 1433-1435 (Floor/Middle/Ceiling rows).** Keep line 1436 (Flagship: 5 scales required). Remove lines 1438-1441 (Middle-tier example is irrelevant under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP).

---

### Block R-09: Landmark Gate Tier-Calibrated Requirements (Lines 1480-1483, 1487-1525)
**~6 lines of tier routing + ~20 lines of Middle-tier evidence**

```
Lines 1480-1483: Tier-calibrated landmark requirements:
  - Floor: Header + main content required. Footer optional.
  - Middle-tier+: Header + main + footer ALL required.
  - Ceiling/Flagship: Header + main + footer + transition grammar.

Lines 1487-1507: "PASS (Middle tier)" example with CSS
Lines 1510-1512: "FAIL (incomplete structure)" Middle-tier reference
Lines 1523: "For Middle+ tier: footer MUST mirror header"
```

**REMOVE lines 1481-1482 (Floor/Middle rows).** Keep line 1483 (Ceiling/Flagship requirement) as universal: "Header + main + footer + transition grammar between ALL landmarks."

**SIMPLIFY lines 1487-1525.** Remove Middle-tier framing. Keep the CSS examples but relabel as universal examples.

---

### Block R-10: Tokenization Self-Check Tier References (Lines 1547, 1599, 1618)
**~5 lines scattered**

```
Line 1547: "Phase 4.9: Tokenization Self-Check (Recommended for Middle-tier+)"
Line 1599: "Middle-tier baseline: Middle experiment achieved 66.5%..."
Line 1618: "NOTE: This phase is OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED. Middle-tier can ship at 66.5%."
```

**Changes:**
- Line 1547: Remove "(Recommended for Middle-tier+)". Becomes "(MANDATORY)."
- Line 1599: Remove or compress to one sentence of provenance.
- Line 1618: Remove. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, tokenization is mandatory, not optional. Target >= 80%.

---

### Block R-11: Scattered Middle/Floor/Ceiling References (~40 lines)
**Various locations throughout the file**

Key instances to remove or simplify:
- Line 942: "Middle-tier baseline: Middle experiment achieved 82 CPL" -- remove tier framing, keep the CPL data point
- Line 1303: "Step 4.2C: Rhythm Variation Requirement (MANDATORY for Middle-tier+)" -- remove "for Middle-tier+"
- Line 1325: "Middle-tier experiment deployed 12 mechanisms" -- remove or compress
- Line 1460: "Sunset clause: Re-evaluate this gate after 10 pipeline runs" -- keep (still valid)
- Lines 1827-1878 (Appendix warnings): No tier references, keep as-is

## PART 2: EXACT ENRICHMENTS TO ADD

### Enrichment E-01: Multi-Coherence Binding Rules
**Source:** 20-MULTI-COHERENCE-DEEP-DIVE.md (rules R-MC-01 through R-MC-06)
**Add to:** Phase 4.3 (Coherence Checking), after Rule C-5
**~35 lines**

**WHY:** Multi-coherence is THE key differentiator between "designed" (3/4) and "composed" (4/4). The current skill has zero explicit multi-coherence rules. CD-006 achieves 6/6 channels shifting at major boundaries; the Flagship achieved 0-1. This enrichment provides the binary rules and perceptual thresholds that prevent the Flagship failure mode.

**Content to add:**

```markdown
### Multi-Coherence Binding Rules (MANDATORY)

Multi-coherence = simultaneous shifting of >=3 CSS channels at a single zone boundary, where ALL channels encode the SAME semantic direction.

**R-MC-01: Transition Table is a Required Deliverable**
Before writing CSS, produce a transition table mapping every major zone boundary to channel shifts. Format:

| Boundary | Ch1 (Chromatic) | Ch2 (Typographic) | Ch3 (Spatial) | Ch4 (Structural) | Direction |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Z1->Z2   | bg delta (>=15 RGB) | font-size delta (>=1px) | padding delta (>=8px) | border delta (>=1px) | [DEEPENING/OPENING/RESOLVING] |

**R-MC-02: Minimum 3 Channels Per Zone Boundary**
At every zone boundary (not every section boundary), >=3 of 6 channels must shift. Section boundaries within a zone can shift 1-2 channels (gradual progression). Zone boundaries MUST shift >=3.

**R-MC-03: Perceptual Thresholds for Channel Counting**
A channel shift only "counts" if it meets these minimums:
- Chromatic: >=15 RGB points between adjacent zone backgrounds
- Typographic: >=1px font-size OR >=0.1 line-height OR >=0.01em letter-spacing
- Spatial: >=8px padding/margin delta
- Structural: >=1px border-width delta OR border appears/disappears
- Density: >=1 component count delta per viewport
- Rhythmic: Different transition type (smooth/bridge/breathing)

**R-MC-04: Direction Agreement**
At each zone boundary, all shifting channels must encode the SAME semantic direction. Declare the direction in the transition table. Post-build: verify CSS values match declared direction.

**R-MC-05: No Contradiction Across Channels**
If background darkens (heavier), spacing MUST NOT loosen (lighter) at the same boundary. Within-zone contradictions are acceptable; zone-level contradictions are failures.

**R-MC-06: Zone Count**
A page with 8-12 sections: 2-4 major zones, producing 2-4 zone boundaries. 3 zones with 2 boundaries is the sweet spot (Orient / Deepen / Synthesize).
```

### Enrichment E-02: Fractal Echo Protocol with 5-Scale Table
**Source:** 22-FRACTAL-DEEP-DIVE.md (synthesis section + template)
**Add to:** Phase 4.7 (Fractal Consistency Gate), replacing existing tier-calibrated requirements
**~30 lines**

**WHY:** The existing fractal gate (Step 4.7) has the right table structure but lacks: (a) the dependency chain (build bottom-up), (b) minimum perceptual thresholds per scale, and (c) the parametric echo concept (components respond to which zone they're in). CD-006 scored 4/5 strong; the Flagship scored 0/5 strong despite filling the table. The difference: CD-006 had perceptible CSS at each scale.

**Content to add (REPLACE existing fractal gate content from line 1416):**

```markdown
### Step 4.7 -- Fractal Consistency GATE (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE proceeding to Phase 5, you MUST complete this gate.**

**Fractal self-similarity = the SAME design pattern at ALL 5 zoom levels.**

**5 Binary Rules:**

1. **BOTTOM-UP CONSTRUCTION:** Build scales in order: Navigation (1) -> Page (2) -> Section (3) -> Component (4) -> Character (5). Never implement Scale N+1 before verifying Scale N is perceptible.

2. **FRACTAL ECHO TABLE (MANDATORY deliverable):**

| Scale | Pattern Expression | Primary CSS | Min Threshold | Verified? |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Navigation | [How header/nav echoes principle] | [Exact CSS] | Padding >= 48px | [ ] |
| Page | [How section arc echoes] | [Exact CSS: zone bgs, padding arc] | BG delta >= 15 RGB | [ ] |
| Section | [How within-section rhythm echoes] | [Exact CSS: grids, margins] | >= 2 types/section | [ ] |
| Component | [How component DNA echoes] | [Exact CSS: .dense/.sparse] | Padding delta >= 4px | [ ] |
| Character | [How text styling echoes] | [Exact CSS: per-zone tracking] | Tracking delta >= 0.02em | [ ] |

Pattern direction MUST be consistent across all 5 rows.

3. **DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION:** After implementing Page scale, squint test (scroll top-to-bottom). If you cannot feel the arc, FIX Page scale before proceeding. Character scale without perceptible Page scale is WASTE.

4. **PARAMETRIC VARIATION:** Components MUST NOT be identical regardless of page zone. Define at minimum `.component.dense` and `.component.sparse` variants with >= 4px padding delta.

5. **3-SCALE MINIMUM for STRONG:** Navigation + Page + Component must ALL be STRONG (pass perceptual verification). Section and Character are bonus layers. 3 strong beats 5 weak.

**CONSISTENCY CHECK:** Does every row describe the SAME named principle? If NO, metaphor is not fractal.
```

### Enrichment E-03: Transition Grammar Enrichment (3 Types with CSS)
**Source:** 20-MULTI-COHERENCE-DEEP-DIVE.md (Section 5), existing Phase 4.6 + 4.2C
**Add to:** Phase 4.6 (Transition Grammar), enriching existing content
**~15 lines**

**WHY:** The existing transition grammar (Phase 4.6) has the lookup table but lacks the SEMANTIC basis for why each transition type exists. Adding the concrete CSS values + semantic justification for each type makes the grammar actionable, not just descriptive.

**Content to add (APPEND after the existing transition lookup table at line 1415):**

```markdown
**Transition Types: Semantic Basis + CSS Values**

| Type | Gap | Border | Semantic | When |
|------|-----|--------|----------|------|
| **SMOOTH** | 48px margin | 1px solid var(--color-border) | Same-axis continuation. Low cognitive shift. | Adjacent sections with same density pattern. |
| **BRIDGE** | 64px margin | Background shift to var(--color-zone-breathing) + 32px padding + prose text | Cross-axis shift with context. Reader needs orientation. | Switching density patterns (F->Bento, Z->Spiral). |
| **BREATHING** | 80px margin | 3px solid var(--color-border) | Major axis shift. Full cognitive reset. | Maximum-distance pattern changes (Spiral->Z, Act breaks). |

**Multi-coherence at transitions:** The transition type IS itself a multi-coherence event. A BREATHING transition shifts spatial (80px gap), structural (3px border vs 1px), and rhythmic (pacing resets) channels simultaneously. This is intentional -- transitions ARE boundaries, so they MUST participate in the multi-coherence protocol.
```

---

### Enrichment E-04: Anti-Scale Model Operationalization
**Source:** 21-ANTI-SCALE-DEEP-DIVE.md (synthesis section, 5-line recipe encoding)
**Add to:** NEW section -- Phase 4.0A (before current Phase 4.0 guardrails), OR as a preamble to Phase 4
**~20 lines**

**WHY:** The anti-scale model (`Richness = semantic density x restraint x spatial confidence`) is the GOVERNING EVALUATION FUNCTION for the entire build. It was absent from the TC skill entirely. The Flagship failed all three factors (density: low, restraint: low, spatial confidence: zero). CD-006 achieved all three at HIGH. Without this model, builders have no frame for evaluating their own work.

**Content to add:**

```markdown
### Phase 4.0A: The Anti-Scale Model (Governing Evaluation Function)

**Every CSS decision you make is evaluated by this formula:**

```
RICHNESS = SEMANTIC DENSITY x RESTRAINT x SPATIAL CONFIDENCE
```

**This is MULTIPLICATIVE. Zero in any factor = zero richness regardless of others.**

- **DENSITY:** Every CSS rule must be perceptible at 100% zoom. Zero waste. >= 2 component types per viewport region. If commenting out a CSS rule causes no visible change, DELETE IT.
- **RESTRAINT:** >= 3 catalog mechanisms deliberately NOT deployed (document in comments). No component type > 35% of instances. Events (drop caps, breathing transitions, grids) are powerful BECAUSE they are rare.
- **CONFIDENCE:** >= 3 distinct grid topologies. 3-tier border system in active use (1/3/4px). >= 5 distinct font-size values. Prose max-width < 80% of container.

**The Flagship failure:** 22% of CSS budget (227 lines) spent on imperceptible micro-typography (letter-spacing 0.001-0.01em). This is ZERO density (imperceptible), ZERO restraint (everywhere), ZERO confidence (timid values). All three factors at zero.

**The CD-006 success:** 41 mechanism instances (density), 40% of mechanisms deliberately withheld (restraint), 5 grid topologies + 3-tier borders + 6 type sizes (confidence).

**Self-check after each section:** Comment out your CSS line by line. If removing a rule causes no visible change at 100% zoom, delete it permanently and use the freed budget on something perceptible.
```

---

### Enrichment E-05: Compositional Intelligence Stack Integration
**Source:** 23-STACK-INTEGRATION.md (dependency chain + build order + worked example)
**Add to:** Phase 4 preamble (before Phase 4.0A), as a 5-line orientation
**~10 lines**

**WHY:** The stack (scales -> channels -> multi-coherence -> anti-scale) is the organizing framework for ALL Phase 4 content. Without this orientation, the builder encounters guardrails, translation grammar, coherence rules, fractal gates, and anti-scale as SEPARATE concerns. With it, they understand these are 4 LENSES on the same CSS decisions.

**Content to add (as Phase 4 preamble):**

```markdown
## Phase 4: Compositional Layout Generation

**Everything in Phase 4 connects through a compositional intelligence stack:**

| Layer | What It Asks | Where in Phase 4 |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| L1: Perception Thresholds | Can the reader SEE your decisions? | Phase 4.0 guardrails |
| L2: Fractal Scales | Does the pattern appear at all 5 zoom levels? | Phase 4.7 fractal gate |
| L3/L4: Channels + Multi-Coherence | Do 3+ CSS properties shift together at boundaries? | Phase 4.3 coherence + multi-coherence rules |
| L5: Anti-Scale Model | Is richness = density x restraint x confidence? | Phase 4.0A anti-scale model |

**Build boundary-by-boundary, not channel-by-channel.** At each zone boundary, write ALL channels simultaneously (background + typography + spacing + borders). NOT "all backgrounds first, then all borders." The transition table forces this simultaneous thinking.
```

---

### Enrichment E-06: Telescope Compression (Conventions Brief as Continuous Zoom)
**Source:** 14-TELESCOPE-MICROSCOPE.md (ACI format, continuous zoom architecture)
**Add to:** Phase 5 (Output section), as guidance for what the builder should receive
**~10 lines**

**WHY:** The TC skill currently outputs a "Thought Process Document" (Phase 5, Output A) that is ~700+ lines of full pipeline trace. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP with the /build-page architecture, the builder needs a ~66-line telescope distillate, not the full trace. This enrichment specifies what the distillate contains.

**Content to add (in Phase 5, Output A):**

```markdown
### Output A: Conventions Brief (Telescope Distillate, ~60-80 lines)

The planner distills the full pipeline output into a conventions brief for the builder:

**Section 1: Content Direction (~15 lines)**
- 3-5 highest-yield axis results (one sentence each: "Reader needs to [VERB] [WHAT] because [CONTENT PROPERTY]")
- Primary tension statement
- Resolution direction (metaphor name + 1-sentence rationale)

**Section 2: Zone Semantic Map (~10 lines)**
- Each zone named with semantic role + progression direction
- Direction principle in one sentence

**Section 3: Core Principle (~5 lines)**
- What makes this page rich (1 sentence)
- What was rejected and why (1 sentence about restraint)
- Squint test target (what the page looks like from 10 feet away)

**Section 4: CSS Domain Extrapolation (~30 lines)**
- For each of 6 CSS domains: progression principle + extrapolation for unstated decisions
- Format: `[Value]: [token] // [zone name] -- [1-line reason]`

**Volume ceiling: 80 lines.** If the brief exceeds 80 lines, compress. The builder holds telescope + microscope simultaneously ONLY at low volume (<200 lines total input).
```

## PART 3: POST-EDIT AUDIT CHECKLIST

### 3A: Orphaned References

After removing tier-conditional blocks, search for these orphaned terms:

| Term | Locations to Check | Action |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| "Floor" (as tier name) | Phase 0D, Phase 4 deployment, fractal gate, landmark gate | REMOVE all "Floor" tier references. If "floor" appears as "perceptual floor" or "guardrail floor," KEEP (different meaning). |
| "Middle" | Phase 0D, Phase 4 deployment, fractal gate, landmark gate, tokenization, rhythm variation, scattered evidence paragraphs | REMOVE all "Middle" as tier name. Keep "middle" in non-tier contexts (e.g., "middle of the page"). |
| "Ceiling" | Phase 0D, 0D-CEILING box, Phase 4 deployment, fractal gate, metaphor rubric qualifier | REMOVE all "Ceiling" as tier name. The 0D-CEILING box contents are promoted to universal; remove the box wrapper. |
| "Flagship" (as conditional) | Throughout -- often as "Ceiling/Flagship" conditional | REMOVE all tier conditionals. "Flagship" can remain as a DESCRIPTION of the quality level, but not as a routing condition. |
| "Middle-tier+" | Phase 4 per-category deployment, rhythm variation, tokenization | REMOVE qualifier. All rules become unconditional. |
| "Ceiling+" | Metaphor rubric, PA-05c scoring reference | REMOVE qualifier. |
| "Middle-tier can ship at..." | Tokenization section | REMOVE. No "can ship at lower threshold" language. |
| "Track 1" | Phase 0D, deployment levels | REMOVE. Track 1 (assembly) is eliminated. |
| "Track 2" | Phase 0D, deployment levels | REMOVE as conditional. If referenced, it's just "the pipeline." |
| "SKIP Phases 1-3" | Phase 0D Middle instructions | REMOVE entirely. No phases are ever skipped. |
| "graceful degradation" | Phase 0D | REMOVE. No degradation exists. |

**Estimated orphaned references:** ~40-50 instances across the file. Each requires individual assessment (tier-conditional = remove, general usage = keep).

---

### 3B: Dead Paths

After tier removal, these conditional paths become dead code:

| Path | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Floor routing (Track 1 assembly) | Phase 0D | DEAD -- removed entirely |
| Middle routing (skip Phases 1-3, pattern selection) | Phase 0D | DEAD -- patterns relocated, skip removed |
| Ceiling routing (proceed to Phase 1) | Phase 0D | DEAD -- this is now the ONLY path, so the condition is unnecessary |
| Graceful degradation documentation | Phase 0D | DEAD -- protocol eliminated |
| Tier-conditional fractal requirements (3 of 4 rows) | Phase 4.7 | DEAD -- only Flagship row survives |
| Tier-conditional landmark requirements (2 of 3 rows) | Phase 4.7B | DEAD -- only Flagship row survives |
| Optional tokenization (for Middle-tier) | Phase 4.9 | DEAD -- tokenization is now mandatory |
| "If routed to Ceiling tier..." conditional | 0D-CEILING | DEAD -- wrapper removed, contents promoted |

**After removal:** Phase 0D should flow directly from Step 0C (Section Identification) to Phase 1 (Multi-Axis Questioning). The only remaining escape valve is the Addition Test (Phase 2) which routes tension-free content to flat mode. This is NOT tier routing -- it is content-form fit detection.

---

### 3C: Broken Cross-References

| Section | References | Status After Removal |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| Phase 1 references to "Ceiling/Flagship tier" | "Ceiling/Flagship tier: Proceed to Phase 1" at end of Phase 0D | REMOVE reference. Phase 1 is always next after Phase 0C. |
| Phase 4 preamble references deployment levels | "Tier-specific deployment levels" list | REPLACE with single Flagship deployment level |
| Phase 4.3 coherence checking references Phase 4.6 | "Transition strength must match axis distance" in C-2 | INTACT (transition grammar is preserved) |
| Phase 4.7 references tier minimums | "Tier-calibrated requirements" in fractal gate | REPLACE with universal "5 scales required" |
| Phase 4.7B references tier requirements | "Tier-calibrated requirements" in landmark gate | REPLACE with universal "Header + main + footer + transition grammar" |
| Phase 4.9 references "Middle-tier+" | Tokenization qualifier | REMOVE qualifier, make mandatory |
| Phase 5 divergence verification | References to "library" and case studies | INTACT (no tier dependency) |
| Appendix warnings reference "all tested layouts" | No tier dependency | INTACT |

### 3D: Opportunities to Strengthen

Sections that were GENERIC because of tier flexibility can now be SPECIFIC to Flagship:

| Section | Current (Generic) | After (Flagship-Specific) |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Phase 0D (what remains)** | 77 lines of 4-tier routing | ~5 lines: "Every page runs the full pipeline. The Addition Test (Phase 2) is the only escape valve for tension-free content." |
| **Phase 4 deployment** | 4 deployment levels | 1 deployment level: "16-18 mechanisms, 3+ reinforcing clusters, multi-pattern composition" |
| **Phase 4 per-category** | "MANDATORY for Middle-tier+" | "MANDATORY" + enriched with multi-coherence binding (E-01) |
| **Phase 4.7 fractal gate** | 4 tier-calibrated rows | "5 scales required" + enriched with dependency chain + perceptual thresholds (E-02) |
| **Phase 4.7B landmark gate** | 3 tier-calibrated rows | "Header + main + footer + transition grammar" unconditionally |
| **Phase 4.9 tokenization** | "Optional, recommended for Middle-tier+" | "MANDATORY. >= 80% compliance." |
| **Phase 4 preamble** | No compositional framework | Stack integration overview (E-05) connecting all Phase 4 content |
| **Pre-Phase 4** | No evaluation function | Anti-scale model (E-04) as governing principle |
| **Phase 4.3** | 5 coherence rules | 5 coherence rules + 6 multi-coherence binding rules (E-01) |
| **Phase 5 output** | Full thought process document (~700+ lines) | Telescope distillate (~60-80 lines) for builder brief (E-06) |

### 3E: Density Patterns Relocation

The CRESCENDO/F-PATTERN/BENTO/PULSE patterns (currently in the removed Middle-tier section, lines 105-113) are VALUABLE vocabulary, not tier-specific routing. They should be relocated to Phase 4.1 as spatial organization options:

**Proposed relocation (append to Phase 4.1, Step 4.1 -- Extract Metaphor Physical Properties):**

```markdown
**Density Patterns (spatial organization vocabulary):**

These patterns describe page-scale density flow. Under metaphor-driven composition, the metaphor SELECTS the pattern; the pattern does not replace the metaphor.

| Pattern | Density Flow | Best When Metaphor Implies |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| CRESCENDO | Sparse -> dense -> resolved | Progressive deepening (geological, archaeological) |
| F-PATTERN | Dense left spine, sparse right content | Hierarchical navigation (editorial, reference) |
| BENTO | Grid-based modular density variation | Parallel independent items (catalog, dashboard) |
| PULSE | Dense-sparse-dense alternation | Rhythmic investigation (Q&A, dialogue, dialectic) |

The metaphor determines WHICH pattern; the content determines WHERE density peaks and troughs occur.
```

## FINAL STATISTICS

| Category | Lines |
|----------|-------|
| **Lines removed (tier routing, conditions, caveats)** | ~180 |
| **Lines promoted (Flagship rules -> universal)** | ~20 (net zero, rewritten) |
| **Lines added (enrichments E-01 through E-06)** | ~120 |
| **Lines relocated (density patterns)** | ~15 (moved, not added) |
| **Net change** | **~-60 lines** |
| **Skill size after edit** | **~1,870 lines** (from ~1,933) |

**Cognitive complexity change:** DRAMATICALLY REDUCED. The builder no longer encounters ANY fork asking "which tier am I?" The remaining content is 100% compositional intelligence with zero routing machinery.

**Compositional intelligence density:** INCREASED. The 120 lines of enrichment add multi-coherence (the #1 missing capability), fractal protocol (with perceptual thresholds), anti-scale model (the governing evaluation function), and stack integration (the organizing framework). These are the EXACT capabilities that separated CD-006 (39/40) from the Flagship (1.5/4).

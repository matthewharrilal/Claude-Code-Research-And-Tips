# Visual Perceptual Audit — Judge A (Extraction-Aware)

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Judge:** Blind Judge A (extraction-aware)
**Context:** Evaluating 5 HTML pages (Page A-E) for perceptual quality within the Identity + Enablement lens. I know the design system uses sharp edges (border-radius: 0), warm editorial palette, and specific typography — these are intentional, not errors. I do NOT know which variant produced each page or what test is being run.

**Framing:** I am evaluating perceptual quality WITHIN the lens framework that constructed compositional-core. This lens values sharp edges, warm editorial palette, compositional flexibility. I am NOT testing whether these are objectively correct design choices — I am testing whether pages achieve quality WITHIN this lens framework.

## PAGE A: Orchestration Approaches

### Cold Look Protocol (1440px)

**5-second impression** (no reading, only absorbing shape/color/weight):

- **Gut reaction:** Clean editorial structure with strong breathing room, feels confident and organized
- **Worst thing:** The black code blocks feel heavy and create visual jolts as you scroll through the warm palette
- **Best thing:** The colored callout boxes (blue, green, coral, yellow) create rhythm and visual landmarks throughout the scroll
- **Ship verdict:** YES

### Tier 1: MANDATORY Five (1440px)

**PA-01: What's the first thing that bothers you?**
- **PASS** — Nothing immediately jarring. The page opens with calm confidence.
- *Justification:* The layout breathes, focal points are clear, gestalt feels cohesive from first glance.

**PA-02: Is any text uncomfortable to read? Point to the worst spot.**
- **PASS** — All text feels comfortable at reading width.
- *Justification:* The main content column feels spacious, line lengths don't stretch uncomfortably, tables don't crush text into narrow cells.

**PA-03: Does this feel like one designer made it, or three?**
- **PASS** — Feels unified, single voice.
- *Justification:* The callout boxes use consistent borders and backgrounds, tables share styling, section dividers follow pattern, code blocks uniform.

**PA-04: Where does your eye go first? Is that where it SHOULD go?**
- **PASS** — Eye lands on the main heading "Orchestration Approaches," then drops to "The Same Goal" subheading.
- *Justification:* Hierarchy works correctly — title dominates, then content unfolds logically down the page.

**PA-05: Would you put your name on this? What would you fix first?**
- **YES** — I would ship this.
- *Fix priority:* If I had to fix one thing, I'd soften the visual weight of the black code blocks — they feel too heavy against the warm editorial palette. Maybe dark warm gray instead of pure black.

### Tier 2: Standard Fifteen (1440px)

**Readability and Comfort:**

**PA-06: Are any words stacking vertically, one per line, in any column?**
- **PASS** — No word stacking observed in tables or grids.

## PAGE B: Staff Engineer Mental Model (Drawing Style)

### Cold Look Protocol (1440px)

**5-second impression:**

- **Gut reaction:** Dense editorial layout with visual anchors (black box, colored callouts), feels serious and structured
- **Worst thing:** The large black section "CRITICAL: Foundation Knowledge" feels heavy and stops momentum, breaks the warm editorial flow
- **Best thing:** The colored callout boxes create clear visual hierarchy and breathing landmarks
- **Ship verdict:** YES

### Tier 1: MANDATORY Five (1440px)

**PA-01: What's the first thing that bothers you?**
- **FAIL** — The massive black callout box dominates the upper fold and creates anxiety.
- *Justification:* Opening the page, the first major visual is a heavy black rectangle with harsh white text. It feels like a warning label or error state, not confident editorial content.

**PA-02: Is any text uncomfortable to read? Point to the worst spot.**
- **PASS** — Text is readable throughout.
- *Justification:* Despite density, line lengths are controlled, leading is adequate.

**PA-03: Does this feel like one designer made it, or three?**
- **PASS** — Feels unified.
- *Justification:* The drawing-number header, section labels ("Plan View," "Elevation View"), and callout boxes share a consistent voice.

**PA-04: Where does your eye go first? Is that where it SHOULD go?**
- **FAIL** — Eye goes to the giant black box, not the content heading.
- *Justification:* The black box pulls focus away from the actual start of the content. Should land on "The Paradigm Shift" but instead fixates on the warning-box aesthetic of the black callout.

**PA-05: Would you put your name on this? What would you fix first?**
- **YES WITH RESERVATIONS** — I would ship this but with concern about the black box.
- *Fix priority:* Replace the solid black background callout with a bordered box using dark warm gray, or restructure it entirely to reduce visual weight.

### Tier 2: Standard Fifteen (1440px)

**Readability and Comfort:**

**PA-06: Are any words stacking vertically?**
- **PASS** — No word stacking.

- *Justification:* Most of the page is light and airy, then one massive dark rectangle disrupts the distribution.

**PA-33: Does largest empty space feel like silence or dropped signal?**
- **PASS** — Spacing feels like breathing pauses.

**Visual Flow and Pacing:**

**PA-12: Do eyes flow smoothly section to section?**
- **FAIL** — The black box creates a visual wall.
- *Justification:* Flow stutters at the black callout — you have to consciously push past it to continue reading.

**PA-13: Clear visual ending or just stop?**
- **PASS** — Page ends clearly.

**PA-34: Are transitions designed moments?**
- **PASS** — Section labels create intentional breaks.

**PA-35: Does interest stay level, peak/valley, or fade?**
- **PASS** — Interest maintains through section variety.

**PA-36: Is there a dramatic visual moment?**
- **YES BUT WRONG** — The black box is dramatic but in a negative way.
- *Justification:* It's memorable, but for creating discomfort rather than emphasis.

**Grid and Layout:**

**PA-14: Does every column have room to breathe?**
- **PASS** — Content feels spacious.

- **PASS** — Steady vertical rhythm.

**PA-41: Does repetition serve purpose?**
- **PASS** — Repetition creates structure.

**Color and Emotion:**

**PA-18: Do neutrals feel like same family?**
- **FAIL** — The pure black callout feels alien to the warm gray/cream palette.
- *Justification:* Everything else uses warm tones, then pure black breaks the temperature consistency.

**PA-19: Any element from different website?**
- **FAIL** — The black box looks like it was pasted from a terminal or error dialog.
- *Justification:* The stark contrast and harsh corners feel like a different design language.

**PA-20: Page personality in three words?**
- **Personality:** Professional, heavy, structured
- **Match intent:** PARTIAL — Should feel authoritative but approachable; the black box tips it toward intimidating.

### Responsive (768px)

- *Justification:* Should land on "The Paradigm Shift" but instead gets stuck on the dark header mass.

**PA-05: Would you put your name on this?**
- **YES WITH RESERVATIONS** — I would ship but uncomfortable with the header weight.
- *Fix priority:* Lighten the header banner — use dark warm gray with white text instead of solid black, or reduce its height significantly.

## CROSS-PAGE SUMMARY

### Perceptual Quality Ranking (Best to Weakest):

1. **Page A** — Clean, balanced, cohesive. Only issue: black code blocks feel heavy.
2. **Page C** — Calm, spacious, confident. Only issue: beige callouts too subtle.
3. **Page E** — Structured, clear, engaging. Only issue: metric box density.
4. **Page B** — Good bones, ruined by massive black callout box breaking flow and temperature.
5. **Page D** — Geological metaphor is clever, execution is oppressive due to black header banner.

### Common Strengths:

- Sharp edges (border-radius: 0) work beautifully throughout — feel intentional and confident, not broken
- Warm editorial palette creates approachable professional tone
- Typography hierarchy is clear and consistent
- Responsive layouts adapt gracefully to narrow viewports
- All pages feel designed by single team with shared vocabulary

### Common Weaknesses:

- **Black elements** (code blocks, callout boxes, header banners) create visual weight problems:
  - Page A: Code blocks too heavy
  - Page B: Massive black callout box dominates and breaks flow
  - Page D: Black banner header oppresses the page opening
- Pages B and D use **pure black** which breaks the warm neutral palette (fails PA-18)
- Pages B and D have **dramatic moments that hurt rather than help** (fails PA-36 spirit)

### Metaphor Analysis:

**Page B (Drawing/Blueprint):** The drawing number and section labels (Plan View, Elevation View) are excellent metaphor execution. The massive black box undermines the metaphor by creating anxiety instead of technical confidence.

**Page C (Metamorphic):** The geological metaphor labels are subtle and effective. The beige callouts might be trying to evoke strata but they lack sufficient contrast to function as landmarks.

**Page D (Geological Layers):** The bedrock/strata/topsoil progression is BRILLIANTLY executed in the sidebar labels. The black banner at top contradicts this by creating a heavy cap instead of emerging from depth. Metaphor concept is excellent, execution has one critical flaw.

**Page E (Lab Protocol):** The measurement/protocol/calibration labels perfectly serve the metaphor. The metric density might be trying to evoke data readouts but crosses into visual clutter.

### Would Ship:

- **YES (no reservations):** Page A, Page C, Page E
- **YES WITH RESERVATIONS:** Page B, Page D

All five pages demonstrate competent execution within the Identity + Enablement lens. The sharp edges, warm palette, and compositional flexibility are consistently applied. The differences lie in how visual weight is distributed and whether dramatic elements support or undermine the reading experience.

The black-element problem (code blocks on A, callout on B, header on D) is the single largest quality differentiator across this set.

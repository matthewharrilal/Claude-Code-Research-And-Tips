# Build Facts — Phase D Execution

**What this document is:** Plain-English descriptions of what each page IS, how it was built, and what made it different. No design jargon. Just facts you can understand without a PhD in web design.

## Track 1: Assembly Test (Orchestration Approaches)

**What the page is about:**
Comparing four ways to run AI coding agents — from simple bash loops to complex multi-agent factories. Technical comparison document with tables, code blocks, and decision matrices.

**How it was built:**
The builder got a library of pre-made pieces (callouts, tables, code blocks) and assembled them like LEGO blocks. No creativity allowed — just use what's in the box.

**The creative process:**
None. This was pure assembly. Read the rules, grab components, stack them in order. Took about 25 minutes.

**What it looks like:**
Clean, technical, readable. Warm cream background, dark text, red accents. Tables compare the four approaches side-by-side. Code blocks show bash scripts. Callout boxes highlight tips and warnings. Very straightforward — looks like a polished technical doc.

**Any problems:**
One minor thing — the "Essence" callout box felt slightly cramped. The italic text wanted more breathing room. But nothing broken.

## Page A: Skill-Only Build (Staff Engineer Mental Model)

**What the page is about:**
A guide for senior engineers learning to orchestrate AI agents instead of writing code themselves. Covers identity shifts, trust problems, and open questions.

**How it was built:**
The builder used ONLY a creative thinking process with NO access to pre-made components. Like: "Here's your content and basic rules. Figure out the right layout yourself."

**The creative process:**
Ran through 9 analysis questions (What should readers FEEL? UNDERSTAND? DO? BECOME?). Identified tensions in the content: automation vs accountability, speed vs reliability. Derived a metaphor from that analysis.

**What it looks like:**
Designed like an **architectural blueprint** with three types of drawings:
- "Plan view" sections (sparse, warm, lots of breathing room) for strategic thinking
- "Elevation view" sections (medium density, white background) for implementation details
- "Section cut" sections (dense, dark background, inverted text) for statistics

The visual rhythm alternates between airy and tight. Feels very deliberate.

**Any problems:**
Container is slightly too wide in some places. Text lines get a bit long. But overall very readable and the metaphor comes through clearly.

## Page B: Weak Permission Build (Staff Engineer Mental Model)

**Same content as Page A.**

**How it was built:**
Same creative process as Page A, BUT the builder was told "the component library is available if you want it." Key test: does knowing the library exists pull you toward using it?

**The creative process:**
Same 9-question analysis. Same tension identification. But derived a completely different metaphor because the builder ignored the library and thought independently.

**What it looks like:**
Designed like a **scientific laboratory** with four zones:
- "Safety briefing" areas (warmest background) for orientation
- "Clean room" sections (pure white) for established facts
- "Transition zones" (medium warmth) for building knowledge
- "Critical control" sections (strongest borders) for important principles

Uses border thickness to show importance levels: thick = critical, thin = routine. Lab vocabulary throughout: "Measurement Protocol," "Calibration Reference," "Error Analysis."

**Any problems:**
Best technical execution of all the creative variants. Container width closest to target. Text comfortable to read. The lab metaphor is clear and consistent.

## Page C: Anti-Gravity Build (Staff Engineer Mental Model)

**Same content as Pages A and B.**

**How it was built:**
Creative process with STRONG enforcement: "You MUST NOT look at the library during creative work." After deriving a metaphor, had to prove it was different before implementing.

**The creative process:**
Same analysis as A and B. Same tensions identified. But this builder had to pass through a checkpoint proving their metaphor was original. Wrote extensive analysis to demonstrate it was genuinely different from library patterns.

**What it looks like:**
Designed like **metamorphic rock formation** — rocks that transform under heat/pressure while keeping their original identity:
- "Diagenetic zone" (barely altered rock) = never-trust operations, super airy spacing
- "Low-grade metamorphic" (some change) = verify-always operations, moderate spacing
- "Medium-grade metamorphic" (transformed but stable) = trust-with-monitoring, tighter spacing

The metaphor shows that engineers transform (coder → orchestrator) while core identity persists. Geological vocabulary: "parent rock," "mineral assemblage," "isograd boundaries."

**Any problems:**
Container too narrow — feels cramped compared to the others. The geological vocabulary is very literal (might be too on-the-nose). But the metaphor is clever and well-executed.

## Page D: Library-First Build (Staff Engineer Mental Model)

**Same content as A, B, and C.**

**How it was built:**
Builder told: "Read ALL the library examples first, then pick the best match and use it." This is intentional pattern-matching to test gravitational pull toward existing patterns.

**The creative process:**
Read 9 library examples. Analyzed which pattern fit best. Selected the "geological confidence encoding" pattern because content had natural layers: established facts → emerging patterns → open questions. Then applied that pattern directly.

**What it looks like:**
Also designed like **geological layers** (similar metaphor to Page C, but intentionally copied from library):
- "Bedrock layer" (thick borders, lots of space) for established truths
- "Strata layer" (medium borders and space) for probable patterns
- "Topsoil layer" (thinner borders) for speculative ideas
- "Atmosphere layer" (thinnest borders) for open questions

Uses border thickness and spacing to show confidence levels. Geological labels on every section: "Bedrock Layer — Established."

**Any problems:**
Too narrow like Page C. The geological labels feel redundant (every section says "Bedrock Layer" or "Strata Layer"). Builder found and fixed a spacing violation during self-audit. Very safe execution — no risks taken.

## Key Differences Summary

**Track 1 vs Track 2:**
- Track 1 = assembly (use pre-made pieces, no thinking)
- Track 2 = composition (figure out your own layout)

**Pages A vs B vs C:**
- All used the creative thinking process
- A = pure creativity, no library awareness
- B = "library available if helpful" (which was ignored)
- C = "must NOT look at library" + prove you're different
- Result: three completely different metaphors (blueprint, laboratory, metamorphic rock)

**Page D vs A/B/C:**
- D deliberately copied from library examples
- A/B/C thought independently
- D converged (geological pattern), A/B/C diverged (unique metaphors)

## What Broke Most Often

**Container width:**
Four out of five pages missed the comfortable reading width. Either too wide (text lines too long) or too narrow (page feels cramped). This was the #1 technical problem across all creative variants.

**Why it matters:**
Too wide = your eyes get tired scanning long lines. Too narrow = page feels squeezed, not enough room for content to breathe. There's a sweet spot that most builders missed.

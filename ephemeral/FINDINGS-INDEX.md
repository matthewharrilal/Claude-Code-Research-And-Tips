## Quick Lookups by Topic

### All 24 Generative Questions (Verbatim)
**Location:** SECTION 1 of master document
**Coverage:**
- DD-001 through DD-006 (Density Dimensions, 6 questions)
- OD-001 through OD-006 (Organizational Dimensions, 6 questions)
- AD-001 through AD-006 (Axis Dimensions, 6 questions)
- CD-001 through CD-006 (Combination Dimensions, 6 questions)

**Format:** Verbatim text with research tracebacks and pattern/type classifications

### Question Evolution by Stage
**Location:** SECTION 2 of master document
**Key insights:**
- DD: Phenomenological questions (metaphor-first)
- OD: Structural hypothesis questions (metaphor-tested-against-organization)
- AD: Compatibility/equivalence questions (geometry-serves-pattern)
- CD: Multi-variable integration questions (all-constraints-coexist)

**Pattern:** Increasing specificity and cumulative constraint burden

### Question Categories
**Location:** SECTION 3 of master document
**Four primary categories:**
1. Phenomenological/Metaphorical (DD)
2. Organizational/Cognitive (OD)
3. Geometric/Axis (AD)
4. Integration/Component (CD)

### TC's 14-Axis Architecture
**Location:** SECTION 4 of master document
**All 14 axes listed:**
- Core 4: FEEL, UNDERSTAND, DO, BECOME
- Extended core: NAVIGATE, TRUST, EVALUATE, ORIENT, RECONCILE
- Structural triggers: COMPARE, IDENTIFY, DISCOVER, SEE, REMEMBER

### Five Structural Differences (TC vs Explorations)
**Location:** SECTION 5 of master document
1. Subject orientation (reader-centric vs structure-centric)
2. Framework type (experiential vs architectural)
3. Generative direction (bottom-up vs top-down)
4. Specificity level (metaphor implies vs pre-specifies)
5. Cumulative vs fresh (carries knowledge forward vs independent)

### Structural Propositions (Missing Category)
**Location:** SECTION 6 of master document
**Key finding:** TC produces emotional descriptions that IMPLY structural propositions but does not STATE them explicitly. Explorations discovered structural propositions like "density correlates inversely with confidence" that TC never generates.

### Bridge Between Experiential and Architectural
**Location:** SECTION 7 of master document
**Core insight:** TC operates in phenomenology (feeling), explorations operate in information architecture (structure). A complete pipeline would translate between these domains via explicit structural propositions derived from TC metaphors.

### Key Findings Synthesis
**Location:** SECTION 8 of master document
**5 major findings:**
1. Exploration questions are research instruments, not creative prompts
2. TC and explorations occupy different question spaces
3. Specificity gap explains richness differences
4. Structural propositions are missing from TC
5. Exploration questions show knowledge compounding

### Deliverable Implications
**Location:** SECTION 9 of master document
**Recommendation:** Pipeline v3+ should add Phase 3.5 to translate TC's phenomenological insights into structural propositions, bridging experiential to architectural frameworks.

## Navigation Tips

**To find a specific generative question:**
→ Use Section 1, organized by stage (DD/OD/AD/CD) then by number

**To understand question evolution:**
→ Read Section 2 for stage-by-stage transformation, then compare examples

**To see research tracebacks:**
→ Look at Section 3 (categories) or individual question entries (Section 1)

**To understand TC framework:**
→ Start with Section 4 (14 axes) then Section 5 (differences from explorations)

**To understand the gap:**
→ Read Section 6 (structural propositions) and Section 7 (the bridge)

**For strategic implications:**
→ Jump to Section 8 (findings synthesis) and Section 9 (deliverable implications)

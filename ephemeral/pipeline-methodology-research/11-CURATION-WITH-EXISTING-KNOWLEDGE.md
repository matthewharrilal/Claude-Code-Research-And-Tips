## 1. The Two Eras: Creating vs Consuming Knowledge

The exploration era (DD through CD, roughly 6 weeks of intensive work) was a KNOWLEDGE CREATION operation. The pipeline era is a KNOWLEDGE CONSUMPTION operation. This distinction is not semantic — it fundamentally changes what "curation" means, what the researcher agent does, and what quality of output is possible.

### The Creation Era

During DD-001 through CD-006, every build was simultaneously:
1. A test of accumulated knowledge (does this research finding actually work as CSS?)
2. A generator of NEW knowledge (DD-F, OD-F, AD-F, CD-F findings)
3. An enrichment of EXISTING knowledge (43-agent OD re-enrichment wave)
4. A revision of PREVIOUS knowledge (ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY evolved from v1 to v2)

Knowledge was alive. It grew. It corrected itself. The corpus at the end of CD was qualitatively different from the corpus at the start of DD — not just larger, but DEEPER. Findings discovered in DD-001 (like the breathing rhythm principle) were tested in DD-006, refined through OD-001, validated across AD, and integrated into CD-006 as part of a fractal self-similarity model that could not have been imagined at DD-001.

The 337 research findings went from "theoretical patterns observed in other design systems" (R1-R5) to "validated implementation-mapped techniques with known failure modes" by the time they had been through 24 explorations.

### The Consumption Era

The pipeline builds pages using a FROZEN knowledge corpus. The 7 vocabulary files, the 24 explorations, the 88 stage findings, the 337 research findings — these exist as a completed body of work. Nothing new is being added. Nothing is being revised. The knowledge is not alive; it is archived.

This creates a fundamentally different relationship between the researcher agent and the knowledge it traverses. In the creation era, Agent-0C (the CD research packager) was compiling packages from a corpus that was STILL GROWING while it worked. OD-F-005 ("Organization IS Density") was discovered mid-stage and immediately changed how subsequent builders approached their work. The researcher was not just selecting from a static corpus — it was tracking a moving target.

In the consumption era, the researcher traverses a completed graph. Every node is stable. Every finding has its final form. This is simultaneously an advantage and a limitation.

---

## 2. Pre-Existing Knowledge as ADVANTAGE

### 2a. Complete Corpus Visibility

The exploration-era researcher (Agent-0C) compiled packages for CD builders while DD-F, OD-F, and AD-F findings were still accumulating. It could not see the full picture because the picture was still being painted. Wave 1 CD builders (CD-001 through CD-003) had access to Wave 1 CD-F findings but not Wave 2. The knowledge graph had temporal boundaries — you could only reference what had been discovered so far.

A pipeline researcher agent has NO temporal boundaries. It can see:
- ALL 18 DD-F findings simultaneously
- ALL 17 OD-F findings simultaneously
- ALL 28 AD-F findings simultaneously
- ALL 25 CD-F findings simultaneously
- ALL 337 research findings simultaneously
- ALL 24 explorations simultaneously

This means it can identify CROSS-STAGE PATTERNS that were invisible during the exploration era. For example:
- Border-weight gradient (Mechanism #1) appears in OD-004 (confidence), AD-004 (angular spiral), and CD-006 (pilot migration) — three different metaphors, three different semantic encodings, same CSS technique. The exploration-era researcher could only see the instances that had been built so far.
- The "dense = uncertain, sparse = certain" principle (spacing compression, Mechanism #4) appears in DD explorations, is refined in OD-004, and becomes a validated general rule by CD. A pipeline researcher sees the full arc from hypothesis to validated technique.

### 2b. Pattern Recognition Across All Stages

Because the corpus is complete, the researcher can answer questions the exploration-era could not:

**"Which mechanisms are truly universal?"**
- Border-weight gradient: 15/18 explorations (83%)
- Dense/sparse alternation: 18/18 (100%)
- Color encoding: 16/18 (89%)
- Zone background differentiation: 12/18 (67%)

**"Which mechanisms are metaphor-specific?"**
- Drop cap: 3/18 (17%) — only editorial metaphors
- Width variation: 3-4/18 (17-22%) — only conversational or creative
- Scroll witness: 4-5/18 (22-28%) — only long-form with navigation needs

**"What combination of mechanisms produces the highest-scoring outputs?"**
- CD-006 (39/40): 11 component types, all 5 axis patterns, 7 transitions, 5 fractal scales
- OD-006 (37/40): All 5 organizational modes, FRACTAL primary, 5th scale (navigation)
- The crown jewels used MORE mechanisms, not fewer — but deployed them with compositional intelligence (sequential, not simultaneous; AD-F-024)

This cross-stage visibility means the researcher can make INFORMED recommendations about which mechanisms to select for a given metaphor, backed by evidence from 24 explorations rather than theoretical reasoning.

### 2c. Known Failure Modes

The exploration era discovered failures through painful experience. AD had no re-enrichment wave — result: 47 "dark matter" items, findings 3.6x less densely threaded than OD. The flagship experiment used a checklist format — result: perceptually flat output with 6 whitespace voids.

A pipeline researcher inherits this failure knowledge for free:
- **Recipe beats checklist.** Builders receiving sequenced steps with CSS values produce DESIGNED output. Builders receiving constraint lists with thresholds produce FLAT output.
- **Sub-perceptual CSS is wasted CSS.** Letter-spacing < 0.025em, background deltas < 15 RGB = invisible to readers.
- **Build boundary-by-boundary, not channel-by-channel.** Setting all CSS channels at each zone boundary produces multi-coherence. Setting all backgrounds first, then all borders, then all typography produces flat output.
- **Metaphor must be STRUCTURAL, not ANNOUNCED.** If the geological metaphor only appears in class names and comments but not in visual perception, it is announced rather than structural.

These failure modes are now CODIFIED. The exploration-era researcher had to discover them in real time.

### 2d. Provenance Chains Are Complete

During the exploration era, provenance was being BUILT as a byproduct of work. Inline threading headers, light provenance sections, formal chain documents — these were added layer by layer, sometimes retroactively (the 18-agent provenance remediation wave for OD). Some provenance chains were incomplete or had gaps.

In the pipeline era, provenance chains are COMPLETE. Every finding can be traced from R1-R5 → DD-F/OD-F/AD-F/CD-F → exploration HTML → case study. The researcher can follow any thread from abstract research finding to concrete CSS implementation without encountering dead ends or unfinished documentation.

---

## 3. Pre-Existing Knowledge as LIMITATION

### 3a. No New Discovery During Curation

This is the most significant limitation. During the exploration era, every build DISCOVERED something new. DD-006 discovered fractal self-similarity at 5 scales (DD-F-006). OD-006 discovered that organization IS density (OD-F-005). AD-006 discovered attention topology as meta-equivalence (AD-F-023). CD-006 synthesized ALL discoveries into a crown jewel.

The pipeline builds ZERO new findings. A page built about JavaScript closures using a "geological stratification" metaphor will deploy existing mechanisms (border-weight gradient, spacing compression, zone background differentiation) without discovering NEW mechanisms or NEW properties of existing mechanisms.

This means the knowledge corpus is FROZEN at February 2026 exploration-era understanding. Any new insight about compositional design that would emerge from building more pages is LOST. The pipeline is extracting value from accumulated capital without reinvesting.

The question is: does this matter? Two perspectives:

**"It doesn't matter because..."**
- The 24 explorations tested a wide enough variety of content types, metaphors, and mechanisms to cover most common cases
- The 337 research findings drew from external sources (Stripe, Vercel, Linear, Notion) that represent the state of the art
- New content being styled does not inherently require NEW compositional techniques — existing mechanisms are combinatorially rich enough to produce novel compositions

**"It matters because..."**
- The exploration era kept finding NEW things right through CD-006 — there is no evidence the discovery well was exhausted
- Content types not yet encountered (interactive tutorials, video-heavy pages, data dashboards) might require mechanisms not in the current catalog
- Design practices evolve — what was state-of-the-art in February 2026 may be dated by 2027
- The 24 explorations were all about the SAME content domain (technical documentation) — different domains (marketing, narrative journalism, academic papers) might reveal mechanisms the current corpus lacks

### 3b. The "Frozen Vocabulary" Problem

The 7 operational vocabulary files represent a fixed snapshot. Consider what happens when a researcher curates for content that sits at the edge of the corpus's coverage:

**Well-covered content:** An API reference guide with variable confidence levels → geological stratification metaphor → border-weight gradient + spacing compression + zone backgrounds. The corpus has OD-004 as a direct case study, 28 AD-F findings about hierarchy encoding, and 15/18 explorations demonstrating border-weight gradient. The researcher can compile a RICH package.

**Poorly-covered content:** An interactive tutorial with live code sandboxes and progressive challenge levels → ? metaphor → ? mechanisms. The corpus has no exploration involving interactivity (all 24 are static HTML). Task-based organization (OD-003) is the closest case study, but it was built for procedural how-to content, not gamified learning. The researcher has fewer reference points, thinner evidence, and must extrapolate more.

The frozen vocabulary creates COVERAGE GAPS that cannot be filled without new exploration. The researcher can still curate — but the package quality varies with how well the content maps to the explored territory.

### 3c. Knowledge Without Experience

The exploration-era researchers had something the pipeline researcher lacks: EXPERIENCE with the knowledge they were curating. Agent-0C compiled packages for CD builders after spending time in the CD stage — reading findings, watching builds, understanding what worked and what failed. The research packages were compiled by an agent that had LIVED through the discovery process.

A pipeline researcher agent is freshly instantiated. It reads the corpus, but it has not EXPERIENCED the corpus. It reads "OD-F-005: Organization IS Density" as a finding with a label and description. Agent-0C read it as a revelation that transformed how it thought about organizational patterns — because it had been there when it was discovered.

This is the difference between KNOWLEDGE and WISDOM. The pipeline researcher has knowledge (it can read all the files). It lacks wisdom (it has not built anything, has not seen failures, has not watched discoveries emerge).

Mitigation: The case studies partially encode this wisdom. The tension narratives in DD-006, OD-004, and CD-006 describe the PROCESS of discovery — what candidates were considered and rejected, what axes were explored and abandoned, what mechanisms were tried and failed. Reading these narratives gives the researcher VICARIOUS experience with the derivation process.

---

## 4. Could the Researcher ALSO Produce Findings?

Yes — and this is potentially the most important architectural decision for the pipeline.

### 4a. What "Findings During Curation" Would Look Like

While curating a package for a build about "JavaScript closures" with a "nesting doll" metaphor, the researcher might notice:

**Cross-pattern observation:**
> "EXT-PIPELINE-001: Nesting metaphors (dolls, boxes, folders) have a natural affinity with fractal self-similarity (DD-F-006). Every nesting metaphor I can construct maps directly to the fractal mechanism — the container/contained relationship IS the fractal recursion at different scales. This suggests fractal self-similarity is not one mechanism among many but is STRUCTURALLY ENTAILED by any nesting metaphor."

**Gap identification:**
> "EXT-PIPELINE-002: The current corpus has no exploration of content where the PRIMARY TENSION is between opacity and transparency — content that deliberately hides and reveals (security documentation, redacted reports, progressive access control). The closest case study (OD-004 confidence) addresses epistemic certainty, not information access. A new mechanism family around 'reveal/conceal' may be needed."

**Implementation refinement:**
> "EXT-PIPELINE-003: Border-weight gradient (Mechanism #1) in PROGRESSIVE mode (4px → 3px → 1px gradient across levels) works for content with 3-4 hierarchy levels. Content with 5+ levels exhausts the gradient — there are not enough perceptually distinct border weights between 4px and 1px to encode 5+ tiers. For deep hierarchies, recommend SWITCHING to zone background differentiation (Mechanism #7) after the 4th level."

### 4b. The Findings Production Architecture

For the researcher to produce findings, the pipeline needs:

1. **A findings namespace.** EXT-PIPELINE-* (or EXT-BUILD-*) for findings generated during curation, distinct from DD-F, OD-F, AD-F, CD-F stage findings.

2. **A findings accumulation mechanism.** New findings must be written to a persistent location that survives across builds. Options:
   - Append to a `pipeline-findings.md` file in compositional-core/
   - Create per-build finding files in a `findings/` directory
   - Annotate the existing FINDINGS-INDEX.md

3. **A findings consumption mechanism.** Future researcher agents must READ previous pipeline findings when curating. This closes the growth loop — build N's researcher discovers something, build N+1's researcher benefits.

4. **Quality gates.** Not every observation during curation is a finding. To earn a finding ID, the observation must pass:
   - **Novelty test:** Is this genuinely new, or is it restating an existing finding in different words?
   - **Transferability test:** Does this apply to more than just the current build's content?
   - **Evidence test:** Is there evidence beyond the current build (can it reference existing explorations or research)?

### 4c. The Growth Loop

With findings production enabled, the pipeline becomes a LEARNING SYSTEM:

```
Build 1: Researcher curates from frozen corpus → Builder builds → Researcher discovers EXT-P-001
Build 2: Researcher curates from frozen corpus + EXT-P-001 → Builder builds → Researcher discovers EXT-P-002, EXT-P-003
Build 3: Researcher curates from frozen corpus + EXT-P-001..003 → Builder builds → ...
Build N: Researcher curates from frozen corpus + EXT-P-001..M → Builder builds → ...
```

Over time, the frozen corpus is enriched by pipeline findings. The knowledge base GROWS again — not through dedicated exploration stages, but as a byproduct of building pages. This is less intense than the exploration era (no 43-agent re-enrichment waves) but it prevents the knowledge from stagnating.

The key architectural question: **How aggressive should the findings production be?**

**Conservative:** Only produce findings when a genuine gap or cross-pattern insight is discovered. Expected rate: 0-2 findings per build. Growth is slow but high-quality.

**Moderate:** Produce findings for gaps, cross-pattern insights, AND implementation refinements. Expected rate: 2-5 findings per build. Growth is steady.

**Aggressive:** Produce findings for everything, including content-specific observations. Expected rate: 5-10 findings per build. Growth is fast but noisy — need quality gates to prevent corpus pollution.

Recommendation: **Moderate.** The researcher should actively look for cross-pattern insights and gap identifications during every curation pass, but should not force findings production. Quality over quantity — a finding must pass the novelty, transferability, and evidence tests before earning an ID.

## 5. Per-Build Curation in Practice: A Worked Example

### The Setup

**Content:** A 3,500-word article about JavaScript closures — explaining what closures are, why they matter, common patterns, common pitfalls, and advanced usage (currying, memoization, module pattern).

**TC output:** Metaphor = "geological stratification" — closures as layers of scope (global bedrock → module stratum → function topsoil → block surface). Tension: the reader must understand that inner scopes INHERIT from outer scopes (geological pressure) while also being able to OVERRIDE (erosion/uplift). Creative condition: "the page should feel like digging down through layers, each layer containing the compressed knowledge of all layers above it."

### Step 1: Researcher Receives TC Output

The researcher reads the conviction brief. It notes:
- Metaphor: geological stratification
- Structural implication: vertical hierarchy (stacked layers, not lateral grid)
- Content properties: 4 scope levels (global, module, function, block), progressive complexity, inheritance relationships
- Creative direction: "digging down" suggests CRESCENDO density (starting sparse/accessible, ending dense/technical)

### Step 2: Researcher Traverses the Corpus

**First stop: Case studies.** OD-004 (Confidence-Based Structure) used geological stratification for API confidence documentation. The researcher reads the full case study — not to give the builder a template, but to understand:
- What mechanisms OD-004 selected (border-weight gradient, spacing compression, zone backgrounds)
- What worked (4px/3px/2px/1px encoding was perceptible and meaningful)
- What the builder needed to know (geological metaphor maps certainty to depth, not complexity to depth)
- What OD-004 MISSED (no fractal self-similarity, no transitions between strata)

**Second stop: Stage findings.** The researcher pulls relevant findings:
- AD-F-013: Angular spiral resolves geological-radial tension (soul constraint forces angular approximation = geological strata)
- AD-F-014: Border-weight gradient IS geological encoding (4px/3px/1px = bedrock/subsoil/atmosphere, skips 2px)
- AD-F-015: Confidence-proportional spacing creates CRESCENDO whitespace
- OD-F-005: Organization IS density (choosing geological organization simultaneously determines CRESCENDO density)

**Third stop: Research findings.** The researcher pulls implementation-relevant research:
- R3-028: Density inheritance (children inherit parent density) — directly maps to closure scope inheritance
- R3-030: Density debt (dense elements require recovery space) — critical for the "advanced usage" section which will be the densest
- R5-012: Component sequencing rule (never stack same-velocity) — the closures article will have multiple code blocks in sequence

**Fourth stop: Exploration HTML.** The researcher examines OD-004-confidence.html CSS to extract:
- Actual border-weight values used (4px/3px/2px/1px confirmed)
- Zone background colors used (cream → warm tan → earth → dark)
- Spacing values at strata boundaries (48px → 32px → 24px progression)
- Transition types used (BRIDGE between strata, BREATHING at major shifts)

### Step 3: Researcher Compiles the Package

The research package for THIS build contains:

**Section 1: Metaphor-Mechanism Mapping (10-15 lines)**
```
Geological stratification for scope layers:
- Global scope = bedrock (4px border, 64px spacing, cream background)
- Module scope = deep strata (3px border, 48px spacing, warm tan background)
- Function scope = shallow strata (1px border, 32px spacing, earth background)
- Block scope = surface (1px border, 24px spacing, light surface)

NOTE: OD-004 used 2px for exploratory strata. For closures, skip 2px
(identity constraint: 2px is structurally ambiguous unless encoding
confidence — scope hierarchy is CATEGORICAL, not GRADIENT).
```

**Section 2: Implementation-Mapped Findings (20-30 lines)**
```
R3-028 → DENSITY INHERITANCE
  Implementation: Each scope section contains nested code blocks showing
  inherited variables. Inner scope CSS should use TIGHTER padding than
  outer scope CSS. Expected evidence: visually obvious that inner scopes
  are "denser" than outer scopes.

AD-F-014 → BORDER-WEIGHT IS GEOLOGICAL ENCODING
  Implementation: .scope-global { border-left: 4px solid var(--color-text) }
  Expected evidence: reader perceives border weight as "importance/depth"
  without needing labels. Must be perceptible WITHOUT reading the border values.

OD-F-005 → ORGANIZATION IS DENSITY
  Implementation: Choosing geological vertical stacking automatically creates
  CRESCENDO density (broad/sparse at top, narrow/dense at bottom). Do NOT
  independently set density pattern — let it emerge from the structure.
```

**Section 3: Anti-Pattern Warnings (5-10 lines)**
```
- Do NOT stack code blocks without breathing (R5-012, max 2 per viewport)
- Do NOT use uniform spacing for all scope levels (defeats geological encoding)
- Do NOT front-load all code examples in section 1 (at least 1 designed moment below 50% scroll)
- Do NOT use 2px borders for any scope level (2px = ambiguous per identity.md)
```

**Section 4: Recommended Component Sequence (10-15 lines)**
```
Opening: Essence callout ("Closures are...") → Overview scope diagram → First code example
Teaching (per scope level): Heading with scope label → Explanation → Code snippet → Tip callout
Pitfall section: Gotcha callout → Code showing common mistake → Reasoning component → Fix code
Closing: Challenge callout → Summary essence → Footer
```

**Section 5: CSS Skeleton (20-30 lines)**
```css
/* Geological scope zones */
.scope-global {
  background: var(--color-bg-cream);
  padding: 64px var(--space-content);
  border-left: 4px solid var(--color-text);
}
.scope-module {
  background: var(--color-bg-warm);
  padding: 48px var(--space-content);
  border-left: 3px solid var(--color-text);
}
/* ... */
```

**Total package: ~100-120 lines, self-contained, per-build.**

### Step 4: Researcher Notes a Discovery

While curating, the researcher notices:

> "R3-028 (density inheritance) maps directly to closure scope inheritance. This is not just a convenient parallel — the compositional mechanism (children inherit parent density) IS the content's subject (inner scopes inherit outer variables). This is a case of CONTENT-MECHANISM ISOMORPHISM: the design system's mechanism and the content's concept are structurally identical. OD-F-006 (meta-documentation as purest density test) identified this for documentation about density. This extends the principle: ANY content whose subject is structurally isomorphic to a mechanism produces the 'purest' implementation of that mechanism."

This becomes EXT-PIPELINE-001 — a genuine cross-pattern finding that adds to the corpus.

## 6. How Curation Differs: Creation Era vs Pipeline Era

| Dimension | Creation Era (DD-CD) | Pipeline Era |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Knowledge state** | Growing, evolving, self-correcting | Frozen, complete, static |
| **Researcher's relationship** | Participant in discovery | Consumer of archive |
| **Package source** | Partial corpus (only what exists so far) | Complete corpus (all 337+88+24) |
| **Cross-stage visibility** | Limited by temporal sequence | Full |
| **Findings production** | Inherent (every build discovered something) | Optional (must be architecturally enabled) |
| **Package quality ceiling** | Limited by incomplete corpus | Limited by frozen corpus |
| **Package quality floor** | Could miss recent discoveries | Has all discoveries available |
| **Risk** | Missing something not yet discovered | Over-relying on known patterns |
| **Advantage** | Living knowledge, growing vocabulary | Complete corpus, known failures |
| **Curation speed** | Slow (must track moving target) | Fast (stable corpus, traversal only) |
| **Cost per build** | High (researcher + discovery + enrichment) | Lower (researcher + traversal only) |

### The Key Difference

In the creation era, curation was GENERATIVE — the act of curating produced new knowledge as a side effect. The researcher who compiled packages for CD builders was ALSO discovering cross-stage patterns that became CD-F findings.

In the pipeline era, curation is SELECTIVE — the act of curating selects from existing knowledge without inherently producing new knowledge. The researcher who compiles a package for a closures article is selecting from the frozen corpus, not discovering new mechanisms.

This is why findings production during curation is not a nice-to-have — it is the mechanism that keeps the knowledge base alive. Without it, the pipeline is a depreciating asset: extracting value from accumulated knowledge without reinvesting.

---

## 7. Staleness: Does the Knowledge Age?

### What Ages

**Design practices evolve.** The R1-R5 research findings drew from Stripe, Vercel, Linear, and Notion's design systems as they existed in late 2025 / early 2026. These companies ship design updates regularly. By mid-2026, their spacing systems, typography scales, and component patterns may have shifted. The research findings would still be VALID (they describe general principles, not company-specific implementations) but they would be DATED (they would not reflect the latest evolution of the state of the art).

**Content types expand.** The 24 explorations all addressed TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION. As the pipeline is used for other content types (marketing pages, narrative essays, academic papers, data dashboards), the corpus's coverage gaps become more apparent. The researcher can still curate, but with thinner evidence for content types far from the explored territory.

**Tools and capabilities change.** The explorations were built as static HTML with CSS. If the pipeline needs to produce React components, or interactive pages with JavaScript, or responsive-first mobile layouts, the exploration-era CSS may not directly transfer. The PRINCIPLES transfer (border-weight encodes hierarchy, dense/sparse alternation creates rhythm) but the specific CSS implementations may need adaptation.

### What Does NOT Age

**Soul principles are timeless.** Angular geometry (border-radius: 0), no shadow/depth simulation (box-shadow: none), warm palette (#FEF9F5) — these are identity decisions, not trend-following. They do not age because they were never based on current practices; they were derived from the system's character.

**Compositional mechanisms are general.** Border-weight gradient, spacing compression, zone background differentiation, dense/sparse alternation — these are visual communication principles rooted in perception science. They do not age because they describe how human vision works, not what is fashionable.

**Stage findings are validated.** OD-F-005 ("Organization IS Density") was tested across 6 organizational explorations and confirmed. AD-F-023 ("Attention Topology" meta-equivalence) was tested across 6 axis explorations and confirmed. These are not opinions or trends — they are TESTED principles. They age only if human perception changes, which it does not on relevant timescales.

### Staleness Mitigation

1. **Findings production keeps the corpus fresh.** Each build that produces EXT-PIPELINE-* findings adds contemporary observations to the corpus.

2. **Periodic research refreshes.** Every 6-12 months, commission a focused R6/R7 research stream examining current design system evolution. This does not need to be as large as R1-R5 (337 findings across 5 streams) — a targeted 20-30 finding refresh on "what has changed since R1-R5" would be sufficient.

3. **Case study expansion.** When the pipeline builds pages for new content types not covered by DD-CD, promote the best results to case studies. This naturally expands the case study layer from 9 to 15, 20, 25 examples over time.

4. **Mechanism catalog expansion.** If pipeline findings reveal genuinely new mechanisms (not just new applications of existing mechanisms), add them to grammar/mechanisms.md. The catalog currently has 20 mechanisms — growth to 25-30 over the next year would be healthy.

---

## 8. The Researcher's Epistemic Position

### What the Researcher KNOWS (and should act on)

- The complete corpus of 337 research findings, 88 stage findings, and 24 explorations
- Which mechanisms are universal (15/18+) vs rare (3-5/18)
- Which metaphor-mechanism pairings have been validated (OD-004 geological, CD-006 pilot)
- Known failure modes (sub-perceptual CSS, checklist format, uniform density)
- Known success patterns (recipe format, boundary-by-boundary building, multi-coherence)

### What the Researcher BELIEVES (and should be transparent about)

- Extrapolations from explored territory to unexplored territory (e.g., "fractal self-similarity probably works for recursive content types like closures" — probable but unvalidated)
- Mechanism-metaphor fit predictions (e.g., "geological stratification should work for scope hierarchies" — the structural parallel is strong but has not been built and tested)
- Quality predictions based on the tier model (e.g., "this content should produce a Ceiling-tier page" — based on mechanism count and content complexity, but the tier model is probabilistic)

### What the Researcher DOES NOT KNOW (and should not pretend to)

- Whether the selected mechanisms will produce perceptually rich output for THIS specific content (until it is built and audited)
- Whether the metaphor is the BEST metaphor for this content (TC derived it, but TC is not infallible)
- Whether there exists a mechanism not in the catalog that would serve this content better (the catalog is comprehensive but not exhaustive)

The researcher should explicitly flag its confidence level in the package:

```
CONFIDENCE: HIGH — geological stratification for scope hierarchies
  Evidence: OD-004 validated geological for confidence, AD-F-014 confirmed
  border-weight encoding. Content-mechanism isomorphism (scope inheritance
  = density inheritance) is structural.

CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM — CRESCENDO density for closures progression
  Evidence: OD-F-005 confirms geological→CRESCENDO is natural. But closures
  content may need PULSE within CRESCENDO (code examples interrupt flow).

CONFIDENCE: LOW — fractal self-similarity for nested scopes
  Evidence: DD-F-006 validated fractal at 5 scales, closure nesting maps
  to fractal recursion. But no exploration has tested fractal with code-heavy
  content where indentation already signals nesting visually.
```

---

## 9. Practical Architecture for the Pipeline Researcher

### Input

1. Content markdown file
2. TC conviction brief (metaphor, creative conditions, compositional arc)
3. Access to the full accumulated knowledge corpus (Layers A-G from 06-DIMENSIONAL-FUNCTIONAL.md)

### Process

1. **Parse TC metaphor** — identify structural implications, content properties, creative direction
2. **Search case studies** — find 2-3 case studies with similar metaphors or similar content tensions
3. **Pull stage findings** — select DD-F/OD-F/AD-F/CD-F findings relevant to the metaphor's mechanisms
4. **Pull research findings** — select R1-R5 findings relevant to the content type
5. **Examine exploration CSS** — extract actual implementation values from relevant explorations
6. **Compile implementation-mapped package** — mechanism → implementation plan → expected evidence → anti-patterns
7. **Flag confidence levels** — HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW for each recommendation
8. **Note any discoveries** — if cross-pattern insights emerge, write EXT-PIPELINE-* findings

### Output

1. **Research package** (100-150 lines, self-contained, per-build)
   - Metaphor-mechanism mapping with CSS values
   - Implementation-mapped findings with expected evidence
   - Anti-pattern warnings
   - Recommended component sequence
   - CSS skeleton
   - Confidence annotations

2. **Pipeline findings** (0-3 per build, optional)
   - EXT-PIPELINE-* findings that pass novelty, transferability, and evidence tests
   - Written to persistent findings file

### Cost Model

The researcher agent is ONE additional agent invocation per build, operating between TC and builder. It reads approximately 3,000-5,000 lines of corpus material and produces 100-150 lines of package. This is less expensive than a builder agent (which produces 800-2,000 lines of HTML+CSS) and significantly less expensive than the 9-auditor PA phase.

Estimated cost: 20-40% of a builder agent's cost. For a Flagship build costing ~$28 total, the researcher would add ~$3-6.

---

## 10. Synthesis: The Three Modes of Curation

The researcher agent does not always do the same thing. Its behavior varies based on how well the content maps to the explored territory:

### Mode 1: DIRECT MAPPING (content closely matches explored territory)

**When:** Content type, metaphor, and mechanisms all have direct precedents in the corpus.
**Example:** API confidence documentation with geological stratification → OD-004 is almost exactly this.
**Researcher behavior:** Heavy reliance on existing case study and exploration CSS. Package is dense with implementation-mapped findings. Confidence levels are mostly HIGH.
**Risk:** Over-reliance on precedent → builder pattern-matches instead of composing. Mitigated by anti-prescription framing in the package.

### Mode 2: ANALOGICAL MAPPING (content has structural parallels to explored territory)

**When:** Content type or metaphor is new, but mechanisms transfer from structurally similar explorations.
**Example:** JavaScript closures with geological stratification → no closures exploration exists, but OD-004 confidence + DD-006 fractal both use geological mechanisms for hierarchical content.
**Researcher behavior:** Combines insights from multiple explorations. Package connects mechanisms to content via structural analogy. Confidence levels are mixed (HIGH for individual mechanisms, MEDIUM for their combination in this new context).
**Risk:** Analogies may not hold — the researcher is extrapolating. Mitigated by confidence annotations and flagging untested combinations.

### Mode 3: EXPLORATORY MAPPING (content is far from explored territory)

**When:** Content type, metaphor, or both have no close precedent in the corpus.
**Example:** Interactive game tutorial with "quest map" metaphor → no exploration involves interactivity, gaming, or quest metaphors.
**Researcher behavior:** Falls back to universal mechanisms (dense/sparse alternation, border-weight gradient, zone backgrounds) and general compositional rules. Package is thinner, with more MEDIUM and LOW confidence. Explicitly flags corpus coverage gaps.
**Risk:** The builder receives a less rich package and must rely more on creative judgment. Mitigated by the researcher noting which mechanisms are universal (work regardless of metaphor) vs which are metaphor-dependent (may not transfer).

### The Mode Distribution Over Time

With findings production enabled:
- Early builds: 30% Mode 1, 50% Mode 2, 20% Mode 3
- After 50 builds: 45% Mode 1, 40% Mode 2, 15% Mode 3
- After 200 builds: 55% Mode 1, 35% Mode 2, 10% Mode 3

As the corpus grows (both through new case studies and pipeline findings), more content types shift from Mode 3 (exploratory) to Mode 2 (analogical) to Mode 1 (direct). The pipeline becomes MORE EFFECTIVE over time, not less — provided findings production is active.

## 11. The Central Paradox

Pre-existing knowledge makes curation EASIER but makes quality growth HARDER.

- Easier: the researcher has a complete corpus, known patterns, validated mechanisms, documented failures
- Harder: the knowledge base does not grow unless deliberately architected to grow

The exploration era had the opposite problem: curation was HARDER (incomplete corpus, moving target, temporal constraints) but quality growth was AUTOMATIC (every build discovered something).

The pipeline must solve for both: easy curation AND continued growth. The researcher agent with findings production is the mechanism that resolves this paradox — it makes curation easy (traverse complete corpus, compile package) while enabling growth (note discoveries during curation, feed them back).

Without findings production, the pipeline is a mine extracting ore from a fixed deposit. With it, the pipeline is a farm that cultivates new growth from existing soil while harvesting current crops.

## 1. Complete Catalog: All 24 Generative Questions

### Stage 1: Density Dimensions (DD-001 through DD-006)

**DD-001 "Breathing"** (Score: 33/40)
> "How does the PULSE pattern (alternating dense/sparse sections) perform as a documentation density strategy under locked KortAI soul tokens?"

**DD-002 "Gradient"** (Score: 35/40)
> "Can documentation pages use a CRESCENDO density model -- starting sparse and progressively tightening -- without sacrificing readability or soul compliance? Does gradual density increase improve onboarding and progressive learning experiences?"

- **In-Body Hypothesis:** "Information density should build gradually from sparse to dense (CRESCENDO pattern), creating natural onboarding that respects cognitive load."
- **Pattern:** CRESCENDO (progressive density increase)

> "Can density rhythm be self-similar across all four structural scales (page, section, component, character) -- and if so, what implementation constraints does that create for every future exploration?"

- **In-Body Hypothesis:** "Good density patterns are self-similar at multiple scales -- the same rhythm of dense/sparse appears at page level, section level, component level, and even character level."
- **Pattern:** FRACTAL (self-similarity at 4 scales)
- **Research Source:** R3-036 (rated EXEMPLARY)
- **Predecessor:** DD-005 lessons ("Visualization at top, labels on elements, flow patterns")

**CD-005 "Multi-Axis Transition"**
> "Can 3 axis patterns coexist sequentially on a single page with proper transition grammar (AD-F-025), where each section commits to ONE pattern (AD-F-024), WAVE density oscillates between MEDIUM/HIGH/MEDIUM-HIGH, and transitions use SMOOTH and BRIDGE types to maintain reading flow?"

## 2. Question Evolution Across Stages

### The Four-Stage Arc

```
STAGE   QUESTION FORM                WHAT IT TESTS             METAPHOR'S ROLE
DD      "Can X work?"                Pattern validation         PROPOSED first, tested
OD      "What if X organized?"       Organizational hypothesis  PREDICTED from pairing
AD      "Does X serve Y?"            Geometry-serves-purpose    TESTED for equivalence
CD      "Can N coexist with M?"      Integration testing        VALIDATED at full scale
```

### DD: "Can X Work?" -- Pattern Validation

DD questions are the most PHENOMENOLOGICAL in the series. They start from a natural metaphor -- breathing, crescendo, islands, geological strata, rivers, fractals -- and ask whether that metaphor can serve as a density strategy. The subject of the question is the PATTERN itself.

**Structural template:** "Can [nature metaphor] work as [density strategy] under [soul constraints]?"

Key characteristics:
- Open-ended and imaginative
- Grounded in physical/natural analogies
- Reference specific research findings (R3-003, R3-047, R3-036)
- Each question is relatively independent (low cumulative load)
- The metaphor is PROPOSED before analysis -- the question tests the metaphor's viability

**Evolution within DD:** Questions become more abstract as the stage progresses. DD-001 asks about a simple alternating pattern. DD-006 asks about self-similarity across 4 structural scales -- a mathematical property, not a natural phenomenon. The stage moves from concrete ("breathing") to abstract ("fractal").

### OD: "What if X Organized?" -- Organizational Hypothesis

OD questions make the first major evolutionary leap. They shift from density phenomena to COGNITIVE STRUCTURE. The canonical form is "What if documentation was organized as X?" -- classical design thinking formulation.

**Structural template:** "What if documentation was organized as [cognitive structure] -- does this naturally create [DD density pattern]?"

Key characteristics:
- Each question explicitly PAIRS with a DD density pattern
- The question PREDICTS which density will emerge ("conversation → PULSE")
- This prediction is testable and falsifiable
- DD-F-006 (fractal self-similarity) becomes a MANDATORY constraint
- Cumulative load increases: each OD must satisfy its own hypothesis AND the fractal constraint

**The critical innovation:** OD questions propose that organizational structure GENERATES density pattern. This is not selection ("use PULSE here") but PREDICTION ("if organized as conversation, PULSE should emerge naturally"). The builder is testing whether the prediction holds, not applying a pre-selected pattern.

**OD-006's culmination:** The final OD question transcends the pattern by asking whether organization and density are the SAME PHENOMENON -- not two layers that interact but one thing observed from two perspectives. This is a theoretical question, not an implementation question.

### AD: "Does X Serve Y?" -- Geometry-Serves-Purpose

AD questions make a second evolutionary leap. They stop asking "what if" and start asking "does X serve or contradict Y" -- a COMPATIBILITY question between axis geometry (reading path) and density-organization identity (the OD-validated pairing).

**Structural template:** "Does [axis geometry] serve or contradict [OD-established density-organization identity]? Does this produce [equivalence mechanism]?"

Key characteristics:
- Questions are MECHANISTIC -- about structural compatibility
- Introduce "equivalence mechanisms" (temporal, spatial, proportional, kinetic)
- Test whether visual scanning path ALIGNS with or FIGHTS density rhythm
- Highest cumulative load: must unify DD density + OD organization + AD geometry
- AD-006 asks the most abstract question in the corpus: whether a meta-equivalence unifies all 4 mechanism types

**The equivalence concept:** AD questions discover that different dimensions can be STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL despite looking different. A Z-Pattern sweep (visual) can be temporally equivalent to a PULSE beat (density). This is the deepest structural insight in the exploration corpus -- it means that visual, spatial, and temporal dimensions can be designed as one coordinated system rather than three independent layers.

### CD: "Can N Coexist?" -- Integration Testing

CD questions complete the arc by stacking MULTIPLE variables and asking whether the combination holds under MULTIPLE constraints simultaneously.

**Structural template:** "Can [component A] + [component B] + [density X] + [organization Y] + [axis Z] coexist without violating [constraint 1, constraint 2, ... constraint N]?"

Key characteristics:
- Most ENGINEERING-ORIENTED questions in the corpus
- Reference the most research (R5: 39 findings, AD-F: 28, DD-F: 18, OD-F: 17)
- Questions are about INTEGRATION TESTING -- not whether individual patterns work, but whether the vocabulary combines at scale
- CD-006 is META-REFLECTIVE ("Can the system explain itself?") -- simultaneously practical and philosophical

**The full arc trajectory:**

```
DD-001: "Can pages breathe?"
              ↓ (increasing specificity)
DD-006: "Can density be self-similar at 4 scales?"
              ↓ (adding organizational dimension)
OD-001: "What if organized as conversation → does PULSE emerge?"
              ↓ (increasing theoretical ambition)
OD-006: "Are organization and density the SAME THING?"
              ↓ (adding geometric dimension)
AD-001: "Does Z-Pattern serve PULSE+TIDAL?"
              ↓ (increasing abstraction)
AD-006: "Is there a meta-equivalence unifying all mechanisms?"
              ↓ (full integration)
CD-001: "Can 3 heavy components + CRESCENDO + F-Pattern + Bento coexist?"
              ↓ (maximum complexity)
CD-006: "Can the system explain itself?"
```

The trajectory moves from CONCRETE OBSERVATION (breathing) to THEORETICAL UNIFICATION (meta-equivalence) to PRACTICAL INTEGRATION (multi-pattern coexistence) to META-REFLECTION (self-demonstration). This is the arc of a research program, not an implementation plan.

## 3. TC Question Architecture (14 Axes)

### The 14 Axes

TC's question framework operates across 14 possible axes, organized in two tiers:

**Extended Core Axes (9):**

| Axis | Question | Domain |
|------|----------|--------|
| FEEL | "What does the reader need to FEEL while navigating this content?" | Emotional |
| UNDERSTAND | "What does the reader need to UNDERSTAND about the relationships?" | Cognitive |
| DO | "What does the reader need to DO with this content after reading?" | Behavioral |
| BECOME | "What does the reader need to BECOME after absorbing this content?" | Transformational |
| NAVIGATE | "How does the reader need to MOVE THROUGH this content?" | Kinesthetic |
| TRUST | "What does the reader need to BELIEVE about this content's authority?" | Epistemic |
| EVALUATE | "What does the reader need to JUDGE about quality, validity, or fit?" | Analytical |
| ORIENT | "What does the reader need to know about WHERE THIS FITS?" | Contextual |
| RECONCILE | "What does the reader need to RECONCILE with prior beliefs?" | Dialectical |

**Structural Trigger Axes (5):**

| Axis | Question | Domain |
|------|----------|--------|
| COMPARE | "What does the reader need to COMPARE?" | Relational |
| IDENTIFY | "What does the reader need to IDENTIFY?" | Recognitional |
| DISCOVER | "What does the reader need to DISCOVER?" | Exploratory |
| SEE | "What does the reader need to SEE?" | Perceptual |
| REMEMBER | "What does the reader need to REMEMBER?" | Retentional |

### How TC Uses These Axes

**Phase 1 (Content Analysis):** TC reads the input content and activates relevant axes. Not all 14 are used for every build -- the content determines which axes are relevant.

**Phase 2 (Tension Derivation):** For each activated axis, TC derives the tension between what the reader needs (Side A) and what the design system personality provides (Side B). The tension is the creative material.

**Phase 3 (Metaphor Collapse):** TC collapses the tensions into a single metaphor that bridges reader needs and system personality. The metaphor is DERIVED from the tensions, not proposed beforehand.

**Phase 4 (Compositional Architecture):** TC extracts mechanism properties from the metaphor across 5 categories (spatial, temporal, material, behavioral, relational).

### TC Output Example

From the Gas Town build:
- Metaphor: "Refinery cross-section"
- Zones: 7 strata (foundation, conversion, operations, infrastructure, principles, surface, dispatch)
- Per-zone: Emotional quality descriptions ("the reader should feel located," "awe at machinery," "intimate understanding")
- Creative invitations: "Try giving the digressions asymmetric margins"
- Structural isomorphisms: "Stacked operational levels from foundation to output"

## 4. The Five Structural Differences

### Difference 1: SUBJECT vs READER Orientation

**Exploration questions** ask about the CONTENT's structure.
- Subject: the information architecture
- Verb: organized as, stratified into, coexist with
- Example: "What if documentation was organized by confidence level?"

**TC questions** ask about the READER's experience.
- Subject: the person consuming the content
- Verb: feel, understand, become, trust
- Example: "What does the reader need to FEEL?"

This is a categorical difference, not a difference of degree. The two question types operate in different domains: information architecture vs. phenomenology.

### Difference 2: ARCHITECTURAL vs EXPERIENTIAL Frame

**Exploration questions** propose a spatial/structural organizing principle first, then test it.
- "What if information was shaped like geological strata?"
- "What if eye-path geometry creates temporal equivalence with density rhythm?"
- The metaphor is proposed FIRST and validated through building.

**TC questions** probe emotional and cognitive states first, then derive structure.
- "The reader should feel progressive revelation"
- "The content has chaos-against-architecture tension"
- The metaphor EMERGES from the tension between reader needs and system personality.

The exploration approach is TOP-DOWN: structural theory → instantiation → evaluation. The TC approach is BOTTOM-UP: content reading → need derivation → tension → metaphor → structure.

### Difference 3: METAPHOR-FIRST vs TENSION-FIRST Derivation

**Explorations START with a metaphor** and test whether it works:
- DD-004 proposes "geological strata" and builds to test it
- OD-001 proposes "conversation → PULSE" and validates the prediction
- AD-001 proposes "Z-sweep = PULSE beat" and measures equivalence

**TC STARTS with tension** and finds a metaphor that bridges it:
- Content has "chaos and architecture" → tension → "refinery cross-section" metaphor
- Content has "precision and humanity" → tension → metaphor emerges

TC explicitly states: "You are CONSTRUCTING a composition, not DISCOVERING one." The explorations do the opposite -- they DISCOVER whether a pre-proposed metaphor is structurally valid.

### Difference 4: CONSTRAINT-TESTING vs CONSTRAINT-DERIVING

**Exploration questions** take constraints as GIVEN and test whether the proposed pattern survives them:
- "Can CRESCENDO work under soul constraints?"
- "Can GEOLOGICAL density maintain DD-F-006 fractal self-similarity?"
- The constraints are fixed; the pattern is the variable.

**TC questions** DERIVE constraints from the content-system tension:
- The constraints are not just the design system's soul -- they include the content's specific demands
- The set of active constraints varies per content
- The pattern is not tested against constraints but generated from them.

### Difference 5: CUMULATIVE vs FRESH-EACH-TIME

**Exploration questions** are deeply CUMULATIVE:
- DD-002 applies DD-001 lessons
- OD-001 explicitly pairs with DD density patterns
- AD-001 tests whether geometry serves OD-001's density
- CD-001 combines DD + OD + AD
- By CD-006, the question references ALL prior stages
- Each question carries the full weight of all prior discoveries

**TC questions** are FRESH for each piece of content:
- The Library Access Prohibition prevents reading prior explorations during Phases 0-3
- Each derivation is independent
- No build's tension analysis inherits from a prior build
- This prevents stale patterns but also prevents cumulative knowledge

**The cumulative load by stage:**

```
DD:  Each question ~ standalone (0-3 prior findings)
OD:  Each question ~ DD pairing + DD-F-006 (5-20 prior findings)
AD:  Each question ~ DD + OD + equivalence theory (20-50 prior findings)
CD:  Each question ~ DD + OD + AD + R5 (50-100+ prior findings)

TC:  Every question ~ 0 prior findings (fresh derivation by design)
```

## 5. The Missing Bridge: Structural Propositions

### What TC Produces That Explorations Do Not

TC contributes genuine creative value that the explorations lack:
- **Emotional arc** ("the reader should feel destabilized then reoriented")
- **Creative invitations** ("try giving the digressions asymmetric margins")
- **Tension-based design motivation** ("chaos against architecture")
- **Metaphor with structural isomorphisms** ("refinery cross-section → stacked levels")
- **Per-zone experiential descriptions** (what each zone should feel like to the reader)

These give the builder CONVICTION -- a sense of what the page should FEEL like. This is not trivial. Without conviction, a builder produces technically correct but emotionally empty pages.

### What Explorations Produce That TC Does Not

The explorations contribute a category of output that TC entirely lacks:
- **Structural hypotheses with testable predictions** ("conversation → PULSE should emerge")
- **Density pattern assignments** (GEOLOGICAL, CRESCENDO, WAVE, PULSE per zone)
- **Fractal constraint specifications** at N scales (page, section, component, character)
- **Density-content correlations** ("density inversely correlates with confidence")
- **Component interaction predictions** ("File Tree and Callout can share left-anchored DNA")
- **Transition grammar specifications** (SMOOTH, BRIDGE, BREATHING per zone boundary)
- **Equivalence mechanisms** (temporal, spatial, proportional, kinetic unifications)
- **Multi-pattern coexistence rules** (which patterns can share a page and how)

These give the builder ARCHITECTURE -- a structural framework that generates CSS decisions from content properties.

### The Missing Category: Structural Propositions

Between TC's experiential output and the builder's CSS decisions, there is a gap. That gap is STRUCTURAL PROPOSITIONS -- statements that connect content properties to visual properties through generative rules.

**TC produces:** "The reader should feel awe at machinery" (experience)
**A structural proposition produces:** "Operational sections get tight spacing (16-24px); principle sections get wide spacing (48-64px); the ratio encodes abstraction level" (generative rule)

The difference in what the builder receives:

| Input Type | Builder Receives | Builder Must Do |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| TC brief (experiential) | "This zone should feel like awe" | Translate feeling → CSS independently |
| Structural proposition | "Density = 1/confidence; spacing = 16px * confidence_tier" | Apply rule to content sections |
| Both (exploration era) | "This zone FEELS like depth; density rule = geological strata with 4px/3px/2px/1px borders" | Fill in creative details within framework |

When the builder only receives TC's experiential brief, the translation from "feeling" to "CSS" defaults to convention. "Feels like awe" → bigger font, maybe bold, centered text. Safe. When the builder receives a structural proposition, the CSS is DETERMINED by the content's own properties -- different content sections get different treatments because the rule generates variation automatically.

### Why Structural Propositions Produce Richer Output

Structural propositions are GENERATIVE RULES. They produce different CSS for different sections based on content properties. This creates INHERENT VARIATION:

**With structural proposition:** "Density inversely correlates with confidence"
- Established section → sparse (64px spacing, thin 1px border, light background)
- Probable section → moderate (32px spacing, 2px border, slightly darker background)
- Speculative section → dense (16px spacing, 3px border, distinct background)
- Open question section → densest (12px spacing, 4px border, marked background)

Four sections, four visually distinct treatments, all generated from ONE rule.

**Without structural proposition:** "The page should feel like geological strata"
- Builder interprets "strata" → uses different background colors
- But backgrounds differ by 2-5 RGB points (imperceptible)
- Spacing is uniform (24px everywhere)
- Border weight is uniform (1px everywhere)

Four sections, one visual treatment applied four times with imperceptible variation. This is exactly the failure mode that PA audits flag: "backgrounds differ by 1-8 RGB points," "uniform typography (all 16px/400)," "6 whitespace voids (210-276px each)."

### The Bridge That Would Connect Them

The exploration architecture had TC's equivalent (the generative question served as the experiential/metaphorical frame) AND structural propositions (the hypothesis specified content-to-visual mappings). The current pipeline has TC but not structural propositions.

The bridge would be a mechanism that takes TC's experiential output and DERIVES structural propositions from it:

```
TC Output: "Refinery cross-section with 7 strata, operations is the density peak"
                    ↓ (structural proposition derivation)
Proposition: "7 zones mapped to strata. Zone density = base_density * (1 + 0.15 * depth_index).

Builder: Receives BOTH the metaphor (conviction) AND the rules (architecture)
```

This bridge does not replace TC. It EXTENDS TC by adding the structural intelligence that the exploration architecture provided through its researcher layer. TC gives the metaphor. The bridge gives the rules. The builder gets both.

## Summary

The 24 generative questions are not creative prompts -- they are RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS that systematically explore a design space. Each question references specific prior findings, makes falsifiable predictions, builds on predecessor discoveries, and tests specific mechanisms. They evolved from open-ended phenomenological inquiry (DD: "Can pages breathe?") through organizational hypothesis testing (OD: "What if docs organized as conversation?") through geometric compatibility analysis (AD: "Does Z-Pattern serve PULSE?") to full integration testing (CD: "Can N patterns coexist?").

TC's 14-axis question architecture is valuable and different in kind. It asks about the reader's inner state, not the page's architecture. It derives metaphors from tension, not proposes metaphors for testing. It is fresh each time, not cumulative.

Neither approach is complete alone. TC provides conviction (what the page should feel like). Structural propositions provide architecture (what CSS rules connect content properties to visual properties). The exploration era had both. The current pipeline has only the first. The missing bridge is a mechanism that derives structural propositions from TC's experiential output -- connecting "the reader should feel X" to "content property Y maps to visual property Z through rule W."

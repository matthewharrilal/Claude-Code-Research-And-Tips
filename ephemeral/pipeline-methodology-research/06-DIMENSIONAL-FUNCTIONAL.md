# Dimensional Analysis: FUNCTIONAL — What Would a Researcher Agent Actually DO?

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Dimension:** Functional (What the researcher agent's work product looks like at every step)
**Companion to:** 01-MASTER-FINDINGS.md (Million Dollar Question)
**Method:** Trace-through of accumulated knowledge, curation mechanics, output specification, and builder experience delta

---

## 1. What Accumulated Knowledge Would It Traverse?

The researcher agent operates on a corpus that the current pipeline compresses to 7 files. The actual traversable knowledge is at least 10x larger and qualitatively different. Here is the complete inventory:

### Layer A: Research Findings (337 items across 5 streams)

| Stream | Count | Key Content |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| R1: Documentation Patterns | 28 | Progressive disclosure, whitespace rhythm, typography hierarchy, viewport distribution |
| R2: Creative Layouts | 27 | Broken grid, pull quotes, editorial asymmetry, magazine layout |
| R3: Density Dimensions | 51 | 6 density dimensions (temporal, depth, semantic, cognitive, interaction, spatial), R3-023 fractal self-similarity |
| R4: Axis Innovations | 192 | Z/F/Gutenberg patterns, bento grid, spiral/diagonal movement, compound |
| R5: Combination Theory | 39 | Component harmony, tension, sequencing, grouping, nesting |

These are NOT "337 bullet points." Each finding is a paragraph-to-page-length description with context, evidence, and conditions. R4 alone is 192 findings covering attention topology — a researcher traversing R4 would be reading on the order of 15,000-25,000 words of spatial layout research.

### Layer B: Stage Findings (88 items, accumulated)

| Stage | Findings | Key Discoveries |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| DD-F | 18 | DD-F-006 fractal (5 scales), DD-F-012 (axis implies density) |
| OD-F | 17 | OD-F-005 (organization IS density), OD-F-FL-001 (org implies axis) |
| AD-F | 28 | AD-F-023 (ATTENTION TOPOLOGY), AD-F-024 (compound is sequential), AD-F-025 (transition grammar 5x5 matrix) |
| CD-F | 25 | Crown jewel CD-006 (all patterns, all components, all transitions) |

Stage findings are the DISTILLED discoveries from building actual explorations. They represent proven truths — things that were hypothesized, built, audited, and survived scrutiny. Each carries provenance to the original research findings it tested.

### Layer C: 24 Validated Explorations (HTML artifacts)

```
DD-001 through DD-006 (6 density explorations, avg 517 CSS lines)
OD-001 through OD-006 (6 organizational explorations, avg 980 CSS lines)
AD-001 through AD-006 (6 axis explorations, avg 897 CSS lines)
CD-001 through CD-006 (6 combination explorations, avg 886 CSS lines)
```

These are not just "reference files." They are PROOF artifacts. Each one embodies specific research findings as CSS. When a researcher reads OD-004, they see geological stratification — confidence-based structure — with 4px/3px/2px/1px border-weight gradient encoding certainty levels. The CSS IS the implementation plan.

### Layer D: Bespoke Commissioned Research (EXT-* findings)

- OD stage: 94 EXT-* findings from 43-agent re-enrichment wave
- AD stage: 33 EXT-AXIS-* findings
- CD stage: per-exploration commissioned research

These are findings that were generated SPECIFICALLY for a given exploration, not from the original R1-R5 research streams. They represent deep dives commissioned because the existing research didn't cover something the builder needed.

### Layer E: Convention Specs and Handoff Protocols

- HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md (3-step acknowledgment gate, density pairings)
- HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md (org-density equivalences)
- HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md (28 AD-F findings, 3-way unification, 5x5 transition grammar)
- AD-CONVENTION-SPEC.md (822 lines — pre-build convention rules)
- ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY documents (v1: 542 lines, v1.1: 576, v2: 518)

### Layer F: 9 Case Studies (anti-prescription format)

Case studies document the PROCESS of specific explorations, not the output. DD-006 fractal, OD-004 confidence, CD-006 pilot migration — each documents: (1) what tension produced this, (2) what candidates were considered and rejected, (3) where mechanisms were applied, (4) what's reusable vs metaphor-specific.

### Layer G: The 7 Operational Vocabulary Files (what the pipeline currently uses)

```
identity.md (87 lines)
vocabulary.md (55 lines)
tokens.css (124 lines)
mechanisms.md (88 lines)
grammar.md (149 lines)
components.css (779 lines)
components.md (37 lines)
```

Total: ~1,319 lines. This is what the builder gets today.

### Total Traversable Corpus

The researcher agent would traverse Layers A through F — on the order of 100,000-150,000 words of accumulated knowledge, research findings, proven explorations, bespoke commissions, and handoff protocols. The pipeline currently compresses this to Layer G: ~1,319 lines, roughly 5,000 words. That is a 20-30:1 compression ratio, and the compression is lossy — it preserves NAMES (mechanism names, token values) while discarding CONTEXT (why this mechanism works for this content type, what conditions produce failure, what the expected perceptual evidence is).

---

## 2. How Would It Curate Per-Build?

This is where the researcher agent diverges from "just giving the builder more files." The researcher does not dump the full corpus on the builder. It CURATES — selecting, filtering, mapping, and packaging knowledge specific to THIS build.

### Step 1: Receive the TC Output

The researcher agent operates AFTER the tension-composition phase but BEFORE the builder. It receives:
- The content markdown
- The TC conviction brief (metaphor, creative conditions, compositional arc)
- The operational vocabulary files (Layer G)

### Step 2: Parse the Metaphor's Structural Implications

Given a TC-derived metaphor like "geological stratification" for a piece of content about API best practices organized by confidence level:

**The researcher parses the metaphor for structural propositions:**
- "Geological" implies vertical layering — content organized by depth
- "Stratification" implies discrete layers with boundaries — not gradients but distinct zones
- Depth correlates with certainty — bedrock (established knowledge) at the bottom, topsoil (speculative) at the top
- Compression increases with depth — established knowledge is dense and terse, speculative is expanded with caveats

**These propositions become SEARCH QUERIES against the accumulated knowledge:**
- "Vertical layering" → R3 density dimensions, particularly depth dimension findings
- "Discrete layers with boundaries" → DD-F-006 fractal scales, zone background differentiation (Mechanism #7)
- "Depth correlates with certainty" → OD-004 confidence-based structure (the geological case study)
- "Compression increases with depth" → Mechanism #4 spacing compression

### Step 3: Traverse Relevant Findings

The researcher NOW reads deeply into the matching corpus. For "geological stratification":

**From R3 (Density):**
- R3-012: "Vertical rhythm creates readable page architecture"
- R3-023: "Fractal self-similarity across scales produces coherence"
- R3-031: "Depth encoding through spacing creates implicit hierarchy"

**From Stage Findings:**
- DD-F-006: Fractal at 5 scales (page, section, component, character, navigation)
- OD-F-005: "Organization IS density" — choosing geological org determines density rhythm
- AD-F-014: "Border-weight gradient IS geological encoding" — proven in AD-004 spiral

**From Explorations (CSS evidence):**
- OD-004 (1,073 CSS lines): Complete geological stratification implementation
  - `.stratum--bedrock { border-left: 4px solid; padding: 24px; }` — maximum weight, compressed spacing
  - `.stratum--topsoil { border-left: 1px solid; padding: 64px; }` — minimum weight, expanded spacing
  - Background progression: dense (#FFFFFF) → sparse (#FEF9F5) → breathing (#FAF5ED)
- AD-004 (894 CSS lines): Angular spiral using geological encoding
  - Confirms border-weight = geological depth across different axis patterns

**From EXT research:**
- EXT-CREATIVE-014: "Confidence encoding requires minimum 3 perceptual channels to be distinguishable"
- EXT-AXIS-007: "Geological metaphors pair most naturally with CRESCENDO density"

### Step 4: Filter by Content Properties

Not all findings apply to THIS content. The researcher filters:

**Content properties (from API best practices article):**
- 4 confidence levels (established, probable, speculative, open)
- Technical content (code snippets, API examples)
- ~4,500 words, moderate length
- Reference-style — reader needs to find information, not read linearly
- No narrative arc — encyclopedic, not story-driven

**Filtering result:**
- INCLUDE: All geological/confidence findings (direct metaphor match)
- INCLUDE: Spacing compression (#4) — confidence-proportional spacing is core
- INCLUDE: Border-weight gradient (#1) — primary hierarchy encoding
- INCLUDE: Zone background differentiation (#7) — 4 strata need 4 backgrounds
- INCLUDE: 2-zone DNA — every stratum section has label + body
- EXCLUDE: Sequential axis deployment (AD-F-024) — not a multi-axis page
- EXCLUDE: Drop cap (#16) — editorial opening, not reference
- EXCLUDE: Choreography findings — not a multi-axis page
- EXCLUDE: Narrative density patterns (CRESCENDO for stories) — reference content

---

## 3. What Would Implementation-Mapped Findings Look Like?

This is the critical quality distinction. The pipeline currently gives the builder mechanism NAMES. The researcher gives the builder PLANS.

### Current Pipeline Output (what the builder sees today)

From `mechanisms.md`:
```
| 4 | Spacing Compression | 12+/18 | DD |
  Inverse density-confidence: more certain = more space,
  less certain = compressed |
```

From `grammar.md`:
```
Density arc across page: Typically intro (sparse) → middle (dense)
→ conclusion (sparse). Geological/confidence content may INVERT this
(certain = sparse, uncertain = dense).
```

Total information for the builder: ~3 sentences. No CSS values, no expected evidence, no constraint linkage.

### Researcher Output (implementation-mapped findings)

```markdown
## FINDING: Confidence-Proportional Spacing
**Source:** R3-031 + OD-F-005 + AD-F-014 + OD-004 implementation
**Mechanism:** Spacing Compression (#4) + Border-Weight Gradient (#1)

### Implementation Plan

For 4 confidence levels (established, probable, speculative, open):

SPACING (vertical padding per stratum):
- Established (bedrock): 24-32px padding — compressed, dense.
  Reader scans established knowledge quickly. Terse assertions.
- Probable: 32-40px padding — moderate breathing room.
  Reader pauses to evaluate evidence strength.
- Speculative: 48-56px padding — expanded, generous.
  Reader needs space to process hedged claims.
- Open: 64-80px padding — maximum breathing.
  Reader contemplates competing hypotheses.

BORDER-WEIGHT (left border per stratum):
- Established: 4px solid var(--color-text)
  Maximum structural weight = maximum epistemic weight
- Probable: 3px solid var(--color-text)
  75% of bedrock weight = 75% epistemic certainty
- Speculative: 1px solid var(--color-text-secondary)
  Minimum weight, secondary color = uncertain territory
- Open: 1px solid var(--color-border)
  Minimum weight, subtle border = open question

BACKGROUND (zone per stratum):
- Established: --color-zone-dense (#FFFFFF)
  Maximum contrast with page background = "this is solid ground"
- Probable: --color-zone-sparse (#FEF9F5)
  Page background = "this is part of the landscape"
- Speculative: --color-zone-breathing (#FAF5ED)
  Breathing zone = "this is transitional territory"
- Open: custom mix between breathing and sparse
  Must be >= 15 RGB delta from speculative (SC-09)

### Expected Evidence (what this should look like)
- Scrolling through the page should feel like descending into bedrock:
  the deeper you go, the more compressed and certain the content
- Border thickness gradient should be visible without measuring:
  4px is OBVIOUSLY different from 1px (3:1 ratio minimum)
- Background warmth increases as you ascend from bedrock to open
- A reader should be able to GUESS the confidence level of a section
  from its visual treatment alone, without reading the label

### Constraint Linkage
- Must honor: SC-09 (>=15 RGB delta at zone boundaries)
- Must honor: SC-10 (<=120px total stacked gap at boundaries)
- Must honor: SC-15 (>=3 distinct border configurations)
- From AD-F-014: "Border-weight gradient IS geological encoding"
  — the gradient is not decorative, it IS the metaphor
- From OD-F-005: "Organization IS density"
  — choosing geological org means the density rhythm is DETERMINED,
    not independently selected
```

### The Difference

| Dimension | Pipeline Output | Researcher Output |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **CSS specificity** | "Inverse density-confidence" (abstract rule) | 24-32px/32-40px/48-56px/64-80px (exact ranges per stratum) |
| **Border values** | "4px/3px/1px encodes hierarchy" (generic) | 4px=established, 3px=probable, 1px=speculative (mapped to THIS content) |
| **Background values** | "4-color background token system" (generic) | #FFFFFF=bedrock, #FEF9F5=probable, #FAF5ED=speculative (mapped with SC-09 compliance) |
| **Expected evidence** | None | "Reader should guess confidence from visual treatment alone" |
| **Constraint linkage** | None | SC-09, SC-10, SC-15 thresholds mapped to plan |
| **Provenance** | None | R3-031 + OD-F-005 + AD-F-014 + OD-004 |
| **Lines of guidance** | ~3 sentences | ~60 lines with CSS examples |

The pipeline gives the builder a NAME. The researcher gives the builder a PLAN — with expected evidence, constraint compliance, exact CSS ranges, and provenance to the research that justifies each value.

## 4. How Would It Bridge TC's Experiential Metaphor to Structural Propositions?

TC derives experiential metaphors. Explorations produced structural propositions. The researcher agent bridges these two question types.

### What TC Produces (Bottom-Up, Experiential)

TC's conviction brief for "geological stratification" contains:

```
WORLD-DESCRIPTION: The reader descends into bedrock. Established knowledge
is compressed under geological pressure — dense, certain, consolidated.
Speculative knowledge is topsoil — loose, aerated, dynamic.

CALIBRATION: Border-weight encodes depth. Spacing encodes certainty.
Background warmth encodes geological layer.

COMPOSITIONAL ARC: Surface (open questions, light) → middle strata
(probable, moderate) → bedrock (established, heavy).
```

This is EXPERIENTIAL — it describes how the page should FEEL. It does not specify HOW to implement that feeling in CSS.

### What Structural Propositions Add (Top-Down, Architectural)

The researcher agent adds the missing structural layer:

```
STRUCTURAL PROPOSITION 1 (from AD-F-014):
  Border-weight gradient IS geological encoding.
  This is not a metaphorical mapping. In 6 validated explorations,
  border-weight was the PRIMARY perceptual signal for depth.
  4px = maximum certainty, 1px = minimum certainty.
  No other mechanism achieves this as reliably.

STRUCTURAL PROPOSITION 2 (from OD-F-005):
  Organization IS density.
  You cannot select geological organization and then independently
  select a density pattern. Geological organization DETERMINES that
  dense = deep and sparse = shallow. The density rhythm is a
  CONSEQUENCE of the organizational choice, not a parallel decision.

STRUCTURAL PROPOSITION 3 (from DD-F-006 + AD-F-027):
  Fractal self-similarity must hold at 5 scales.
  The geological metaphor must be visible at:
  (1) page scale: bedrock→topsoil section progression
  (2) section scale: within each stratum, dense/sparse paragraph alternation
  (3) component scale: callout label (sparse) + body (dense)
  (4) character scale: code (dense) + prose (sparse)
  (5) navigation: TOC mirrors geological ordering

STRUCTURAL PROPOSITION 4 (from AD-F-025):
  Transition grammar at stratum boundaries.
  Moving from established → probable = SMOOTH transition (same domain,
  intensity shift). Moving from speculative → open = BREATHING transition
  (phase change). Transition type is DETERMINED by the confidence delta
  between adjacent strata.
```

### The Bridge Function

TC says: "The reader descends into bedrock."
Structural propositions say: "Here's HOW that descent is implemented — border weight at 4px/3px/1px, spacing at 24-80px, backgrounds at three distinct zone tokens, transitions at SMOOTH between adjacent strata and BREATHING at phase changes."

TC provides CONVICTION (why this metaphor, what the reader feels).
Structural propositions provide ARCHITECTURE (what CSS implements, what constraints apply, what evidence to expect).

The builder needs BOTH. Without TC's conviction, the builder produces technically correct but emotionally flat output. Without structural propositions, the builder produces emotionally resonant but architecturally uncertain output — they know the page should "feel like descending into bedrock" but don't know what CSS values make bedrock feel like bedrock.

---

## 5. What Would the Output Research Package Look Like?

### Package Structure

```markdown
# Research Package: [Content Title]
# Metaphor: [TC-Derived Metaphor]
# Date: [Build Date]
# Researcher: [Agent ID]

## 1. Soul Checklist (MANDATORY — copied, not referenced)
- border-radius: 0 on all elements
- box-shadow: none on all elements
- No gradients, no semi-transparent backgrounds, no cool grays
- Colors from tokens.css: --color-primary #E83025, --color-background #FEF9F5...
- Typography trinity: Instrument Serif (display), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (code)

## 2. Metaphor-Content Fit Analysis
[How the TC metaphor maps to this specific content's structure.
Which content sections become which metaphorical elements.
Where the metaphor is strong (natural mapping) and where it strains.]

## 3. Implementation-Mapped Findings (4-8 findings, ordered by build priority)

### Finding 1: [Title]
**Source:** [R-X + Stage-F + Exploration citation]
**Mechanism:** [Catalog mechanism name + number]
**Implementation Plan:**
  [Specific CSS ranges, values, expected evidence]
**Constraint Linkage:**
  [Which gates/thresholds apply]

### Finding 2: [Title]
... (same format)

## 4. Structural Propositions (3-6 propositions derived from research)
[Top-down architectural rules that the TC brief implies but doesn't specify.
Each proposition cites specific stage findings.]

## 5. Anti-Pattern Warnings (2-4 warnings, specific to this build)
[What this metaphor is MOST LIKELY to get wrong, based on exploration evidence.
Not generic anti-patterns — specific to this content + metaphor combination.]

## 6. CSS Evidence from Relevant Explorations (50-100 lines of reference CSS)
[Actual CSS from the 1-2 most relevant explorations, annotated with WHY
each property value was chosen. Not for copying — for understanding the
REASONING behind specific values.]

## 7. Expected Perceptual Result
[What a fresh-eyes auditor should see. What the page should feel like
at 1440px. What the scroll rhythm should be. What the dominant visual
signal should be. Written in experiential language.]
```

### Package Length

Target: 100-200 lines per package (matching Agent-0C's CD-era packages). This is deliberately constrained — the researcher's job is CURATION, not information dumping. 100-200 lines from 100,000+ words of accumulated knowledge represents 500:1 selective curation. That curation is the value.

### What Makes This Different from "Just More Files"

The package is:
1. **Self-contained** — the builder never needs to leave it
2. **Implementation-mapped** — findings come with CSS plans, not just names
3. **Per-build** — curated for THIS metaphor and THIS content, not generic
4. **Ordered by build priority** — the builder reads top-to-bottom and builds in sequence
5. **Constraint-linked** — every finding maps to gate thresholds the builder must pass
6. **Evidence-annotated** — reference CSS shows WHY values were chosen, not just WHAT they are
7. **Anti-pattern warned** — specific to this build, not generic catalog

---

## 6. How Does This Differ from "Just Giving the Builder More Files"?

This is the critical quality distinction. The difference is not QUANTITY but CURATION.

### Approach A: Give the Builder More Files (Volume Strategy)

```
Builder receives:
- tokens.css (124 lines)
- mechanisms.md (88 lines)
- grammar.md (149 lines)
- components.css (779 lines)
- components.md (37 lines)
+ R3-DENSITY-DIMENSIONS.md (51 findings, ~2,000 words)
+ OD-004-confidence.md (case study, ~400 lines)
+ AD-outbound-findings.md (28 findings, ~1,000 words)
+ HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md (~200 lines)
Total: ~4,000 lines
```

**What happens:** The builder receives 4,000 lines of raw material with no mapping to THIS specific content. They must mentally traverse, filter, select, and map — all while simultaneously writing CSS and maintaining compositional intent. This is like giving a jazz musician the complete Real Book (400+ standards) and saying "play something good" — the problem isn't the vocabulary, it's the SELECTION and APPLICATION.

**Predicted outcome:** Builder cherry-picks 5-10% of the material (first things they see, most obvious patterns), ignores the rest, produces output that is wider but not deeper. Information overload paradoxically produces LESS targeted output because the builder optimizes for "use what I can" rather than "use what fits."

### Approach B: Researcher Curates a Package (Quality Strategy)

```
Builder receives:
- tokens.css (124 lines)
- components.css (779 lines)
- TC conviction brief (~80-120 lines)
- Research package (~150 lines, curated)
Total: ~1,200 lines
```

**What happens:** The builder receives LESS total material but HIGHER quality material. Every line in the research package is there because a researcher agent determined it was relevant to THIS metaphor and THIS content. The findings are implementation-mapped (specific CSS values), constraint-linked (gate thresholds), and evidence-annotated (reference CSS with reasoning).

**Predicted outcome:** Builder follows the research package as a compositional guide. Each finding leads to specific CSS. Expected evidence gives the builder a target to verify against. Anti-pattern warnings prevent the most likely failures. The builder produces output that is PRECISELY targeted because every input was curated for precision.

### The Quality Distinction

The difference is a LIBRARIAN versus a SHELF.

A shelf holds every book. A librarian reads every book and then hands you the three that answer YOUR question, with the relevant pages bookmarked and margin notes explaining why those passages matter for your specific situation.

The exploration era had librarians (Agent-0C). The pipeline has shelves (7 vocabulary files). The researcher agent restores the librarian function.

Specifically:
- **Selection:** 500:1 curation ratio (150 lines from 100,000+ words)
- **Mapping:** Every finding linked to CSS implementation for THIS metaphor
- **Ordering:** Build-priority sequencing (what to implement first)
- **Warning:** Anti-patterns specific to THIS metaphor + content combination
- **Evidence:** Expected perceptual result described before building begins

---

## 7. What Would the Builder's Experience Be DIFFERENT from Today?

### TODAY: Builder Experience (Pipeline Status Quo)

```
1. Builder receives TC conviction brief.
   "This page is geological stratification. Reader descends into bedrock."
   (Experiential direction — HOW it should feel.)

2. Builder receives 7 vocabulary files (1,319 lines).
   mechanisms.md lists 20 mechanisms with 1-line descriptions.
   grammar.md lists compositional rules generically.
   components.css has CSS implementations for all components.
   (Generic tools — no connection to THIS specific metaphor.)

3. Builder must independently:
   a. Read the conviction brief
   b. Parse the metaphor's structural implications
   c. Decide which mechanisms to use (from 20 options)
   d. Decide how to implement each mechanism for THIS metaphor
   e. Choose specific CSS values (padding, borders, backgrounds)
   f. Map content sections to zones
   g. Ensure perceptual thresholds are met
   h. Maintain compositional intent while writing 800+ lines of CSS

4. Builder has NO reference for what "correct" looks like.
   No expected evidence. No prior exploration to study.
   No anti-pattern warnings for this specific metaphor.

5. Builder produces output.
   PA audit finds: uniform typography, imperceptible background deltas,
   sub-perceptual letter-spacing, whitespace voids.
   Why? Because the builder had the CONVICTION but not the ARCHITECTURE.
   They knew the page should feel like bedrock descent, but not that
   border-weight gradient IS geological encoding (AD-F-014), or that
   backgrounds must be >=15 RGB apart (SC-09), or that spacing
   compression is inversely proportional to certainty.
```

### AFTER: Builder Experience (With Researcher Agent)

```
1. TC agent derives conviction brief (same as today).
   "This page is geological stratification."

2. Researcher agent traverses accumulated knowledge.
   Finds: OD-004 (geological confidence, 1,073 CSS lines),
   AD-F-014 (border-weight IS geological encoding),
   OD-F-005 (organization IS density),
   DD-F-006 (fractal at 5 scales).
   Filters by content properties (4 confidence levels, reference-style, ~4,500 words).

3. Researcher agent produces curated package (~150 lines).
   Contains:
   - 5 implementation-mapped findings with exact CSS ranges
   - 4 structural propositions linking TC metaphor to CSS architecture
   - 3 anti-pattern warnings specific to geological metaphor
   - 50 lines of annotated reference CSS from OD-004
   - Expected perceptual result description

4. Builder receives: conviction brief + research package + vocabulary files.
   NOW the builder knows:
   a. WHAT mechanisms to use (curated, not "pick from 20")
   b. HOW to implement them (CSS ranges, not names)
   c. WHY each value (provenance to research findings)
   d. WHAT to avoid (anti-patterns for geological metaphor)
   e. WHAT correct looks like (expected perceptual evidence)
   f. WHAT thresholds to hit (constraint linkage to gates)

5. Builder produces output.
   The geological stratification is VISIBLE because the builder
   had both conviction AND architecture. Border-weight gradient
   is obvious (4px vs 1px = 3:1 ratio). Backgrounds are distinct
   (>= 15 RGB delta, mapped to specific strata). Spacing compression
   creates palpable descent sensation. The page feels like descending
   into bedrock because the builder knew exactly how bedrock is
   implemented in CSS.
```

### The Experience Delta (Before vs After)

| Dimension | Today (without researcher) | After (with researcher) |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Mechanism selection** | Builder picks from 20 mechanisms blind | Researcher pre-selects 4-6 mechanisms with rationale |
| **CSS values** | Builder invents values from generic rules | Builder receives specific ranges mapped to strata |
| **Expected result** | None — builder guesses what "correct" looks like | Described in experiential terms before building |
| **Anti-patterns** | Generic catalog of 7 anti-patterns | 2-4 warnings specific to THIS metaphor |
| **Constraint compliance** | Builder must cross-reference gates independently | Findings pre-linked to gate thresholds |
| **Reference CSS** | None — builder writes from scratch | 50-100 lines from relevant exploration, annotated |
| **Provenance** | None — builder has no research context | Every finding traced to R-X + Stage-F + Exploration |
| **Builder cognitive load** | HIGH — derive architecture + write CSS simultaneously | LOWER — architecture provided, focus on composition |
| **Build time** | Full creative + architectural derivation | Creative application of architectural plan |
| **Predicted PA outcome** | Conviction present, architecture uncertain | Conviction + architecture aligned |

### The Core Shift

Today the builder does TWO jobs simultaneously:
1. **Architect** — decide what CSS implements the metaphor
2. **Builder** — write the CSS that implements the architecture

The researcher agent splits job #1 out. The researcher is the ARCHITECT (traverses knowledge, produces implementation plans). The builder is the BUILDER (takes the architectural plan and writes CSS with compositional fluency).

This mirrors the exploration era exactly: Agent-0C (researcher) compiled implementation-mapped packages; builders consumed them and built. The builder's creative authority was not diminished — they still chose HOW to compose within the architectural framework. Their cognitive load was reduced because they didn't have to simultaneously derive architecture AND compose CSS.

---

## 8. Risks and Failure Modes

### Risk 1: Researcher Becomes a Bottleneck
If the researcher agent is slow or produces low-quality packages, it adds latency without quality improvement. Mitigation: The researcher's traversal can be parallelized with TC derivation (researcher starts reading corpus while TC runs, then filters after TC completes).

### Risk 2: Over-Curation (Too Prescriptive)
If the researcher produces a 300-line package that specifies every CSS value, the builder becomes a CSS typist, not a composer. The package must provide ARCHITECTURE (structural propositions, CSS ranges, expected evidence) while leaving COMPOSITION (exact values, transitions, local decisions) to the builder. 100-200 lines is the target — enough to guide, not enough to prescribe.

### Risk 3: Researcher Produces Static Packages
If the researcher always produces the same package for "geological" metaphors regardless of content, the curation is not per-build. The content's properties (length, structure, audience, domain) must filter the findings. An API reference needs different geological implementation than a research essay.

### Risk 4: Package-Brief Conflict
If the researcher's structural propositions contradict TC's conviction brief, the builder is caught between two authorities. Resolution: The researcher operates DOWNSTREAM of TC — structural propositions must be COMPATIBLE with the conviction brief, not override it. TC provides conviction, researcher provides architecture that supports that conviction.

### Risk 5: Knowledge Staleness
If the accumulated knowledge includes findings from DD-001 (early, low-quality) alongside CD-006 (late, high-quality), the researcher must weight by quality, not just relevance. CD-006 findings supersede DD-001 findings on overlapping topics. The researcher must understand the accumulation timeline.

The researcher sits between TC and Builder. It receives TC's output (metaphor, creative conditions) and produces the research package the builder consumes alongside the conviction brief.

### Token Budget

- TC brief: ~80-120 lines (~400-600 tokens)
- Research package: ~100-200 lines (~500-1,000 tokens)
- tokens.css: 124 lines (~500 tokens)
- components.css: 779 lines (~3,000 tokens)
- Total builder input: ~1,200-1,400 lines

This is COMPARABLE to today's builder input (~1,400 lines). The difference: today's 1,400 lines are generic; tomorrow's 1,400 lines are curated.

### Cost

One additional Opus agent invocation. At current pricing, approximately $2-5 per build depending on traversal depth. The exploration era spent 149 agents across OD alone — one researcher agent is modest by comparison.

## 10. The Answer to the Million Dollar Question

> "What would it mean for the pipeline to have a researcher agent that does what Agent-0C did for the CD explorations?"

It would mean the pipeline restores the missing CURATION layer between accumulated knowledge and the builder. Not by giving the builder more files (volume), but by giving the builder a bespoke, implementation-mapped, constraint-linked, evidence-annotated research package that transforms mechanism NAMES into implementation PLANS.

The researcher agent is a LIBRARIAN, not a FILE SERVER. It reads 100,000 words, curates 150 lines, and in doing so transfers not just information but ARCHITECTURAL INTELLIGENCE — the structural propositions that connect TC's experiential metaphor to specific CSS implementations. The builder gains both conviction (from TC) and architecture (from the researcher), producing output that is simultaneously emotionally resonant and structurally precise.

This is not a theoretical proposal. Agent-0C did exactly this for CD-001 through CD-006, producing 100-200 line packages per exploration. The packages contained soul checklists, applicable findings EMBEDDED (not referenced), relevant stage findings, CSS examples, anti-pattern checklists, and implementation plans. The result: CD-006 scored 39/40.

The pipeline's current builder has conviction without architecture. The researcher agent provides the architecture.

# 06 -- Irreducible Concepts Map: 13 Concepts to Concrete Pipeline Mechanisms

**Agent:** concept-mapper (Opus 4.6)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Task:** #6 -- Map each of the 13 irreducible concepts to concrete pipeline v3 mechanisms
**Sources:** Reports 51, 56, 45, 46, 28 (independence analysis, concept independence, beyond-eight integration, meta-mechanism, beyond-eight catalog)

---

## STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

The 13 irreducible concepts follow a funnel architecture discovered in Reports 51 and 56:

```
3 PRECONDITIONS ──> 1 GATEKEEPER ──> 2 CAPABILITIES ──> QUALITY
                                      + 1 bridge concept
```

More precisely:

```
PRECONDITIONS                    GATEKEEPER           CAPABILITIES
  P1: Content-Form Coupling ──>                     ┌─> Intentional Composition
  P2: Compression Physics ────> Builder Cognitive ──>├─> Peak-Valley Architecture
  P3: Spec. Interference ────>  Mode (COMPOSING)   └─> Scale-Channel Independence
                                                         │
MISSING (6)                                              │ (bridge)
  Temporal Composition                                Pervading Metaphor
  Reader Model                                        Compositional Fluency
  Emotional Arc
  Compositional Anti-Patterns
  Cross-Page Coherence
  Revision Quality
```

For each concept, the pipeline must decide: is it SPECIFIED (binary rule the builder executes), ACTIVATED (dispositional -- the pipeline creates conditions for emergence), or EMERGENT (conditions only -- the pipeline cannot control it directly)?

The key insight from Report 45: **18 structural concepts survive compression perfectly. 22 contextual concepts must be RE-GENERATED by each agent.** The pipeline should SPECIFY structural, ACTIVATE contextual.

---

## CONCEPT 1: BUILDER COGNITIVE MODE

**Type:** THE GATEKEEPER (everything flows through this)
**Classification:** ACTIVATED (dispositional)

### What It Is

The builder's psychological relationship to the task. Four modes with different quality ceilings:

| Mode | Ceiling | Triggered By |
|------|---------|-------------|
| COMPOSING | 4/4 (DESIGNED) | Dispositional recipe, world-description framing, creative authority, Opus model |
| PLANNING-THEN-EXECUTING | 3.0-3.5/4 | Procedural recipe with explicit steps |
| COMPLYING | 2.5/4 | Checklist, constraint-heavy specs, prohibition overload |
| REPAIRING | 2.0/4 | Fix cycle gate failures, PA quotes as correction lists |

This single state variable determines quality ceiling more than any specification content. It generates 11 of the original 40 beyond-eight concepts (A-01 through K-07 via chain).

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: CONVENTIONS BRIEF FORMAT CONTROL**

The pipeline does NOT tell the builder "be in COMPOSING mode." It creates the conditions:

1. **Document format ratio enforcement:** The conventions brief must maintain:
   - >= 50% world-description (framing that creates a world to compose within)
   - >= 15% recipe (concrete CSS examples that MODEL composing)
   - <= 30% constraint (binary rules, thresholds, prohibitions)
   - >= 5% creative authority clause
   - RULE: guardrail-to-playbook ratio <= 2:1 in builder-visible sections

2. **Creative authority clause placement:** Must appear in the FIRST 20 lines of any document the builder reads. "These are not rules to comply with. They are the physics of human perception." Framing that appears after constraints is too late to shift mode.

3. **Model selection:** Opus for builder role (non-negotiable). Opus treats instructions as floors; Sonnet treats them as ceilings.

4. **Single builder ownership:** One Opus agent plans AND builds. No handoff compression.

5. **Fix cycle format control:** When gates fail, fix instructions are delivered as RECIPE (sequenced steps with CSS values), never as CHECKLIST (pass/fail with correction demands). This prevents COMPOSING -> REPAIRING mode regression.

### Verification

- **Pre-flight check:** Count guardrails vs playbooks in builder-visible text. Ratio must be <= 2:1.
- **Pre-flight check:** Creative authority clause appears in first 20 lines. Binary: yes/no.
- **Pre-flight check:** Builder model is Opus. Binary: yes/no.
- **Post-build signal:** Builder produced self-authored artifacts (transition table, fractal echo doc) without being told to. Presence indicates COMPOSING mode was achieved.
- **Post-build signal:** Builder overrode or extended specification values with perceptual reasoning. Indicates composing, not complying.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Catastrophic.** If the builder enters COMPLYING mode, quality ceiling drops to 2.5/4 regardless of all other concepts. Every downstream concept depends on this one. The Flagship experiment is the existence proof: 14 mechanisms, multi-coherence verified, all gates passed, PA-05 1.5/4. The builder was in COMPLYING mode because of a 71-line checklist with 88% constraints.

---

## CONCEPT 2: CONTENT-FORM COUPLING

**Type:** PRECONDITION (property of the input)
**Classification:** SPECIFIED (content analysis) + ACTIVATED (builder discovers coupling)

### What It Is

Content is a co-author of the design. Content properties determine how many mechanisms can be meaningfully deployed and what metaphor can pervade the form. Seven content properties predict higher PA-05:

1. Code blocks (enable dark background zones + monospace contrast)
2. Multiple content modes (prose + lists + tables + code)
3. Procedural sequences (enable stepped visual treatment)
4. Questions (enable Q&A visual pattern)
5. High-contrast visual anchors (diagrams, visualizations)
6. Domain transitions (enable zone boundary justification)
7. Self-referential content (enable self-demonstrating design)

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: CONTENT ANALYSIS PHASE (before building)**

1. **Content heterogeneity scoring:** Before any building begins, the pipeline runs a content analysis that produces a heterogeneity score. The TC (tension-composition) pipeline already does this -- it derives the metaphor FROM the content. Pipeline v3 makes this explicit:
   - Count content modes present (prose, code, lists, tables, Q&A, diagrams)
   - Score: 1 mode = LOW (cap at ~60% mechanism deployment), 2-3 = MEDIUM, 4+ = HIGH
   - The score does NOT gate the build. It CALIBRATES expectations: low-heterogeneity content cannot achieve the same mechanism variety as high-heterogeneity content.

2. **Content-mechanism affinity map:** The TC brief derivation phase maps each content section to mechanisms it naturally supports. "This section has a code block -> dark background zone is natural here." "This section transitions topics -> zone boundary with multi-coherence shift is natural here." The map is delivered to the builder as SUGGESTIONS, not requirements.

3. **Metaphor derivation instruction:** The TC pipeline instruction remains: "Derive a metaphor from the content's natural structure." This is an ACTIVATION instruction -- it tells the builder to discover what the content affords, not to apply a pre-determined metaphor.

### Verification

- **Pre-build check:** Content analysis phase completed. Content heterogeneity score documented.
- **Pre-build check:** TC brief contains content-mechanism affinity map. At least 3 natural mechanism insertion points identified.
- **Post-build check:** Mechanism deployment aligns with content structure (mechanisms appear where content affords them, not arbitrarily distributed).

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Quality cap.** If content is all-prose with no structural variety, mechanism deployment opportunities are capped at ~40% of potential. The pipeline produces a competent but undistinguished page because there aren't enough natural insertion points for diverse visual treatment. The fix is content selection (choose heterogeneous content) or content restructuring (add code examples, tables, Q&A where they naturally fit).

---

## CONCEPT 3: COMPRESSION PHYSICS

**Type:** PRECONDITION (information-theoretic principle)
**Classification:** SPECIFIED (volume limits, format rules, encoding requirements)

### What It Is

Intelligence degrades through indirection boundaries. Past a threshold, more instruction reduces quality by consuming working memory and triggering compliance mode. The interference model: quality = f(model_capability - instruction_interference).

The survival hierarchy:
- Tier 1 (code values, closed enumerations, binary prohibitions): survives ANY compression. Context dependency = 0.
- Tier 2 (recipes with CSS values, named patterns with examples): survives 1-2 levels. ~5:1 lossy but functional.
- Tier 3 (abstract frameworks, quality models): survives 1 level at most. 99.6% loss at 5 levels.
- Tier 4 (perceptual calibration, gestalt composition): DOES NOT SURVIVE. Must be re-generated.

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: ENCODING DOWNSHIFT ENFORCEMENT**

The pipeline systematically converts high-tier information to low-tier before it reaches the builder:

1. **Builder-visible line limit:** The builder sees <= 200 lines of instruction total (conventions brief). This is the empirically validated threshold. The 609-line conventions brief that produced Gas Town is at the upper bound; the 963-line master prompt that produced the Flagship failure exceeded it catastrophically.

2. **Format hierarchy enforcement:** Every compositional intent in the builder's instructions must include:
   - A CSS code block (Tier 1) -- not prose description
   - OR a closed vocabulary set (Tier 1) -- finite enumeration of valid options
   - OR a recipe with exact values (Tier 2) -- "at each zone boundary, set bg + border + font-weight"
   - NEVER: abstract framework alone without concrete CSS (Tier 3+)

3. **Indirection depth limit:** The builder reads the conventions brief DIRECTLY. Maximum 1 level of indirection from embodied patterns. No "read file X which references file Y which references file Z" chains.

4. **Single-document principle:** The conventions brief IS a continuous zoom document (Report 28, K-03) -- principles at the top, CSS values at the bottom, progressive zoom between. NOT two documents (telescope brief + microscope recipe) unless total volume exceeds 500 lines.

### Verification

- **Pre-build check:** Count lines in builder-visible instructions. Must be <= 200. Binary.
- **Pre-build check:** Count Tier 3+ information units (abstract frameworks without CSS). Must be 0. Binary.
- **Pre-build check:** Every mechanism reference includes a CSS code block or closed vocabulary. Count: exceptions must be 0.
- **Pre-build check:** Maximum file reference depth from builder = 1. No transitive references.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Mode regression.** Excessive instruction volume pushes the builder from COMPOSING to COMPLYING. This was the Flagship failure: 963 lines of mixed signals activated contradictory modes (COMPOSING for recipes, COMPLYING for constraints, REPAIRING for gates). The compression cascade consumed the cognitive space where compositional quality would otherwise emerge.

---

## CONCEPT 4: INTENTIONAL COMPOSITION (Multi-Coherence + Pervading Metaphor)

**Type:** CAPABILITY (unlocked by COMPOSING mode)
**Classification:** ACTIVATED (recipe format with CSS values) + EMERGENT (metaphor embodiment)

### What It Is

Two sub-concepts that collapsed into one irreducible:

**Multi-coherence:** >= 3 CSS channels (of 6: chromatic, typographic, spatial, structural, behavioral, material) shifting together at zone boundaries. The visual signature of compositional intention.

**Pervading metaphor:** A conceptual mapping from a source domain to the page's form, embodied in CSS STRUCTURE (not just text labels). Three levels: absent (0%), announced (40% quality contribution), structural (90%).

The test: remove all text labels -- does the CSS structure still communicate the metaphor?

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Multi-coherence mechanism: RECIPE WITH EXACT CSS VALUES**

1. **Boundary-by-boundary recipe:** The conventions brief provides, for each zone boundary:
   ```
   Z1 -> Z2: bg #FEF9F5 -> #F0EBE3, border 3px, font 400->500, spacing 64px->48px
   ```
   This is Tier 2 encoding -- procedure with values. It survives compression because it tells the builder WHAT TO DO at each boundary with exact values.

2. **Channel count minimum:** >= 3 channels shifting at each major boundary. Binary verification.

3. **Perception threshold enforcement:** Each channel shift must meet minimum deltas:
   - Chromatic: >= 15 RGB points between adjacent zone backgrounds
   - Typographic: >= 2px font-size difference OR >= 100 font-weight difference
   - Spatial: >= 24px padding/margin difference between zones
   - Structural: border-weight change (4px -> 3px -> 1px) visible

**Pervading metaphor mechanism: TC PIPELINE + ACTIVATION INSTRUCTION**

The metaphor CANNOT be pre-specified for all content. It must be derived per-page:

1. **TC pipeline derivation:** The tension-composition pipeline reads the content and derives a metaphor. This is a COMPOSING-mode act by the TC agent.

2. **Metaphor level instruction:** The builder receives: "The metaphor must be STRUCTURAL -- CSS structure embodies it. Test: could a reader infer the metaphor from the design alone, without reading any labels?" This activates the builder's metaphor-generation capability and sets the bar.

3. **Metaphor verification gate:** Post-build, a fresh-eyes auditor answers: "What is the organizing metaphor? Did you detect it from structure or from labels?" This is a perceptual gate, not a programmatic one.

### Verification

- **Programmatic gate:** Count channel shifts at each major boundary. >= 3 channels at each. Binary.
- **Programmatic gate:** Perception thresholds met (>= 15 RGB, >= 24px spatial, etc.). Binary per channel.
- **Perceptual gate (fresh-eyes):** "What is the page's organizing metaphor?" If answer references structure (layout, spacing, border patterns): STRUCTURAL. If answer references labels: ANNOUNCED. If answer is "none detected": ABSENT.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Ceiling but not Flagship.** CD-006 achieved multi-coherence (39/40) but without a PERVADING metaphor -- it had local coherence at each boundary but no global organizing principle. The result was CEILING tier, not Flagship. Multi-coherence without pervading metaphor = technically excellent, experientially competent. Pervading metaphor without multi-coherence = themed but visually flat. Both are needed for Flagship.

---

## CONCEPT 5: PEAK-VALLEY ARCHITECTURE

**Type:** CAPABILITY (unlocked by COMPOSING mode)
**Classification:** ACTIVATED (recipe provides valley-peak rhythm model) + EMERGENT (specific peak placement)

### What It Is

The alternation between mechanism-active peaks and mechanism-silent valleys that creates an experiential waveform. Three collapsed sub-concepts:

- **Designed Moments (F-01):** Visual elements that make the reader pause -- "someone thought about this." >= 1 per scroll quartile for Flagship.
- **Deliberate Absence (G-05):** Silence zones where no mechanisms operate. Content breathes in unadorned prose. Signal-to-silence ratio: 0.6-0.8:1.
- **Grand Spatial Pause (F-04):** Deliberate, confident use of large whitespace. Pause (intentional) vs void (accidental).

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: RHYTHM RECIPE IN CONVENTIONS BRIEF**

1. **Density arc template:** The conventions brief models the rhythm:
   ```
   Opening (Z1): SPARSE -- authority through restraint, dark header, minimal mechanisms
   Building (Z2): MODERATE -- introduce mechanisms, component variety increases
   Climax (Z3):  DENSE -- peak mechanism deployment, designed moments, grids
   Resolution (Z4): SPARSE -- return to breathing, bookend with opening
   ```
   The specific content of each zone is builder-determined. The ARC is provided.

2. **Signal-to-silence ratio instruction:** "For every 600px of mechanism-active content, provide 600-800px of mechanism-silent content (base typography, no decoration)." This is Tier 2 encoding -- measurable but requiring judgment about WHERE.

3. **Designed moment minimum:** >= 1 designed moment per scroll quartile. Types provided as examples (not requirements):
   - A callout box with distinctive border + background shift
   - A pull-quote in Instrument Serif with border treatment
   - A data display (grid of key metrics)
   - A code example with annotation
   The builder CHOOSES which moments fit this content.

4. **Void vs pause instruction:** "Whitespace > 120px stacked at any boundary is a VOID unless the surrounding zones establish a rhythm that justifies the silence. If you create 80px+ transition spacing, make it feel EARNED by the surrounding mechanism density."

### Verification

- **Programmatic gate:** Stacked gap at any section boundary <= 120px (Report 28's threshold for void detection). Binary.
- **Perceptual gate:** "Where are the designed moments?" Fresh-eyes auditor identifies >= 1 per scroll quartile. If fewer: FAIL.
- **Perceptual gate:** "Are there breathing zones (mechanism-silent prose)?" If auditor identifies at least 2 deliberate silence zones: PASS. If entire page is mechanism-active or mechanism-silent: FAIL.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**"Professionally competent" without "someone designed this."** A page with uniformly excellent composition has no experiential peaks. The Middle experiment hit this ceiling: PA-05 4/4 DESIGNED in vocabulary, but no surprise moments. The viewer perceives competence but not artistry. Peak-valley architecture is what creates the "designed" feeling that distinguishes Flagship from Ceiling.

---

## CONCEPT 6: SPECIFICATION INTERFERENCE

**Type:** PRECONDITION (removing barriers has higher ROI than adding concepts)
**Classification:** SPECIFIED (enumerable barriers with binary checks)

### What It Is

8 concepts collapsed into one principle: specific pipeline configurations that prevent quality. The 14 quality suppressors are not root causes -- they are the INTERFACE between compression physics (which creates them) and builder cognitive mode (which they damage). Removing suppressors has higher ROI than adding concepts.

5 ABSOLUTE suppressors (presence guarantees quality degradation):
1. Checklist format (triggers COMPLYING mode)
2. Prohibition overload (7.9:1 guardrail-to-playbook ratio)
3. Inverted quality routing (best files go to planner, not builder)
4. Sub-perceptual emphasis (effort directed toward invisible micro-differences)
5. Analytical process drift (analysis displaces creation)

9 CONTEXTUAL suppressors (harmful in specific configurations).

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: SUPPRESSOR ABSENCE CHECKLIST (pre-flight)**

The pipeline runs a pre-flight check before any building begins. Each suppressor is tested for ABSENCE:

| # | Suppressor | Test | Pass Condition |
|---|-----------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Checklist format | Count instruction types in builder doc | >= 50% world-description/recipe, < 30% constraints |
| 2 | Prohibition overload | Count guardrails vs playbooks | Ratio <= 2:1 |
| 3 | Inverted quality routing | Check which files builder receives | Builder receives mechanism catalog + component CSS + case studies |
| 4 | Sub-perceptual emphasis | Check for micro-typography directives | Zero instructions for letter-spacing < 0.025em or RGB delta < 15 |
| 5 | Analytical process drift | Count generative vs analytical phases | At least 1 generative phase (playbook writing) before building |
| 6 | Missing coherence checks | Gate architecture review | Multi-coherence gate exists with perceptual thresholds |
| 7 | Zero inter-agent communication | Communication protocol specified | Builder has a mechanism to articulate concerns (even if file-based) |
| 8 | Multi-pass fragmentation | Build architecture review | Single builder, not multi-pass with handoffs |
| 9 | Perceptual threshold blindness | Threshold table in builder doc | Perception thresholds appear as physics, not rules |
| 10 | Component library deprivation | Component CSS availability | Builder has access to components.css |
| 11 | Content-form decoupling | TC brief existence | TC brief with content-derived metaphor exists |
| 12 | Repair mode | Fix cycle format | Fix instructions are recipes, not checklists |
| 13 | Agent model mismatch | Builder model | Builder is Opus |
| 14 | Exemplar deprivation | Visual references | Builder has access to >= 1 case study HTML |

**All 14 must PASS (suppressor ABSENT) before building begins.** Any failure is BLOCKING.

### Verification

- **Pre-flight gate:** 14/14 suppressor absence checks pass. Binary for each. All must pass.
- **Post-build audit:** If PA-05 < 3/4, review suppressor checklist for any that re-emerged during the build process (especially #12 repair mode if fix cycles occurred).

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Quality division.** Each active suppressor divides builder capability. The quality equation: Quality = (Builder Skill x Content-Form Coupling x Metaphor) / Sum of Active Suppressors. The Flagship had 5+ active suppressors (checklist format, prohibition overload, inverted routing, sub-perceptual emphasis, zero communication). Result: 1.5/4 despite Opus capability and 14 mechanisms deployed.

---

## CONCEPT 7: SCALE-CHANNEL INDEPENDENCE

**Type:** CAPABILITY (multi-scale perception)
**Classification:** SPECIFIED (closed vocabularies for scales and channels) + ACTIVATED (inter-scale coherence)

### What It Is

Multi-scale perception: confident intention visible at every zoom level (5 scales: Navigation, Page, Section, Component, Character). Scale-channel independence means the same design system identity is recognizable whether you are looking at the full page, a single section, a component, or a character. This is fractal self-similarity applied to the identity layer.

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: CLOSED VOCABULARIES AT EACH SCALE**

1. **Tokens as Tier 1 encoding:** The token system (tokens.css) provides closed vocabularies:
   - Colors: 11 values (finite set, no additions)
   - Spacing: 12 steps (finite scale)
   - Typography: 3 families, 4 weights, defined size scale
   - Borders: 3 weights (4px, 3px, 1px)

   These survive any compression because they ARE the specification. The builder selects from the vocabulary; they don't invent new values.

2. **Scale-specific deployment recipe:**
   ```
   Navigation scale: dark header, primary-color border, max typography weight
   Page scale: container width 960px, zone backgrounds from warm palette
   Section scale: border-weight gradient (4px primary -> 3px secondary -> 1px tertiary)
   Component scale: component-specific border-color, background tint, internal spacing
   Character scale: font-size/weight per content type, letter-spacing from scale
   ```

3. **Stack progression instruction:** "Channels PRODUCE multi-coherence, which REALIZES anti-scale." This single sentence (Report 28, K-06) makes the dependency chain explicit. Without it, builders treat the 8 CI concepts as independent checkboxes.

### Verification

- **Programmatic gate:** All CSS values drawn from token vocabulary. Zero off-palette colors, zero off-scale spacing values. Binary.
- **Programmatic gate:** At least 3 scales have distinct visual treatment (e.g., page-level container + section-level backgrounds + component-level borders). Binary.
- **Perceptual gate:** Fresh-eyes auditor zooms to 3 levels (full page, single section, single component) and answers: "Does each level feel intentionally designed?" If yes at all 3: PASS.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Identity loss at specific zoom levels.** The page may look excellent at full-page zoom but have no identity at the component level (all components look identical) or at the character level (uniform typography throughout). CD-006 achieved this across all 5 scales. The Flagship failed at component and character scales (1 component type, uniform 16px/400 typography).

---

## MISSING CONCEPT 8: TEMPORAL COMPOSITION

**Type:** MISSING (the catalog's largest blind spot)
**Classification:** ACTIVATED (rhythm model provided) + EMERGENT (scroll experience)

### What It Is

The 40 original concepts are all SPATIAL -- they concern what the page looks like at any moment. But pages are experienced TEMPORALLY through scrolling. No current concept addresses:
- Scroll rhythm (acceleration/deceleration of visual density across scroll)
- Anticipation (visual hints of upcoming content changes)
- Memory (later elements echoing earlier elements across substantial scroll distance)
- Scroll pacing (how many viewport-heights between major visual events)

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: SCROLL PACING GUIDELINE IN CONVENTIONS BRIEF**

1. **Viewport-height pacing rule:** "A major visual event (zone boundary, designed moment, grid layout change) should occur every 1.5-2.5 viewport-heights (roughly every 1000-1600px at 1440px viewport). Fewer than 1 per 3vh = monotonous. More than 1 per 1vh = chaotic."

   This is Tier 2 encoding -- measurable with judgment about what counts as a "major visual event."

2. **Density acceleration/deceleration model:** The conventions brief models scroll experience as acceleration:
   ```
   Opening: SLOW (sparse, large spacing, few elements per vh)
   Building: ACCELERATING (increasing density, more elements per vh)
   Climax: PEAK VELOCITY (densest zone, most visual events per vh)
   Resolution: DECELERATING (decreasing density, returning to opening rhythm)
   ```

3. **Scroll memory instruction:** "If the opening zone uses a distinctive visual pattern (e.g., dark header with primary-color border), echo that pattern in the closing zone. The reader who scrolls back up should feel the page was composed as a whole."

   This is the bookending concept (G-03) reframed as temporal composition.

### Verification

- **Programmatic gate:** Measure distance between major visual events (zone boundaries, component type changes, grid layout changes). Flag any gap > 2400px (roughly 3vh at 768px viewport).
- **Perceptual gate:** Fresh-eyes auditor scrolls the full page and answers: "Did the scroll feel paced (events at regular intervals) or monotonous (long stretches without change)?"

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Monotonous scroll experience.** Gas Town's Z3 (dense) is the longest zone by content volume. If Z3 is 50% of scroll height, the "climax" lasts too long and becomes monotonous regardless of how rich the composition is within Z3. The page may be spatially excellent but temporally boring.

---

## MISSING CONCEPT 9: READER MODEL

**Type:** MISSING (who the reader is)
**Classification:** SPECIFIED (brief includes reader context) + ACTIVATED (builder designs for reader)

### What It Is

No current concept addresses WHO the reader is or what they already know. The page treats the reader as generic. But reader entry point, prior knowledge, device, and attention state all affect how the design should function.

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: READER CONTEXT IN TC BRIEF**

1. **Reader persona line:** The TC brief includes a single line defining the primary reader:
   ```
   PRIMARY READER: [Role/background], arriving via [channel], knowing [prior context]
   Example: "Developer familiar with Yegge's writing, arriving from Hacker News, expecting technical depth"
   ```

2. **First-5-seconds sequence:** The conventions brief defines the arrival sequence:
   ```
   Arrival: Authority + warmth (dark header, warm colors)
   Orientation: "What is this page?" answered in < 2 seconds
   First delight: A designed moment within first scroll
   Spatial confidence: "This page knows what it is"
   Gut verdict: Stay or leave (must be STAY)
   ```

3. **Mobile consideration:** "The page must be coherent at both 1440px and 768px. Horizontal composition (grids) must degrade gracefully to stacked layout. Peak-valley rhythm must hold at both viewports."

### Verification

- **Pre-build check:** TC brief contains reader persona. Binary.
- **Post-build check:** Audit at both 1440px AND 768px. Both must pass minimum PA thresholds.
- **Perceptual gate:** "Within 2 seconds of seeing the page, can you answer: what is this page about?" If yes: PASS.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Design-content disconnect.** A beautifully composed page that doesn't orient the reader quickly enough, or that assumes knowledge the reader doesn't have, fails at the experience level regardless of compositional quality. The first 5 seconds are the entire evaluation window for most readers.

---

## MISSING CONCEPT 10: EMOTIONAL ARC

**Type:** MISSING (how the reader FEELS)
**Classification:** EMERGENT (conditions only -- cannot be specified)

### What It Is

The density arc (sparse -> dense -> sparse) and the coherence arc (Opening -> Climax -> Resolution) are STRUCTURAL. But the EMOTIONAL arc -- how the reader FEELS as they scroll -- is not addressed:
- Surprise requires unexpected visual events (not predictable zone shifts)
- Delight requires craft exceeding expectations (not meeting them)
- Authority requires consistency before variation (not variation throughout)
- Closure requires the ending to feel EARNED (not just symmetric)

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: EMERGENT -- enabled by other concepts, not directly specified**

The emotional arc CANNOT be specified because specifying it ("create surprise at scroll position 40%") destroys the surprise. Instead, the pipeline creates conditions for emotional engagement:

1. **Surprise through designed moments:** Peak-valley architecture (Concept 5) creates the rhythm that makes peaks surprising. The builder decides WHERE to place moments of craft.

2. **Delight through terminal craft:** Builder cognitive mode (Concept 1) in COMPOSING state produces terminal craft -- finishing details that exceed expectations. The creative authority clause enables this.

3. **Authority through soul consistency:** Scale-channel independence (Concept 7) with closed vocabularies ensures every zoom level feels deliberate. Authority comes from the viewer sensing a consistent mind behind the design.

4. **Closure through bookending:** Temporal composition (Concept 8) with scroll memory instruction creates closing-opening echo.

5. **The single activation instruction:** The conventions brief includes: "The optimal scroll rhythm mirrors narrative: arrival -> hook -> engagement -> surprise -> deepening -> climax -> release -> closure." This is a DISPOSITIONAL instruction (Report 28, E-04) -- it tells the builder HOW TO THINK about scroll rhythm, not what CSS to write.

### Verification

- **Perceptual gate only:** "How did you FEEL scrolling this page?" The PA auditor's subjective response is the only meaningful verification. Expected responses for success: "intentional," "confident," "the ending felt complete." Expected responses for failure: "monotonous," "abrupt," "the ending just stopped."
- **No programmatic gate possible.** Emotional arc is Tier 4 information -- experiential, requires living understanding.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Technically excellent, emotionally neutral.** The page passes all structural gates and achieves multi-coherence but doesn't create an emotional response. The viewer acknowledges competence without feeling engagement. This is the "professionally competent" ceiling -- pages that nobody dislikes but nobody remembers.

---

## MISSING CONCEPT 11: COMPOSITIONAL ANTI-PATTERNS

**Type:** MISSING (how mechanisms combine badly)
**Classification:** SPECIFIED (binary prohibitions)

### What It Is

The design system has CSS anti-patterns (no 2px borders, no rounded corners) but no PAGE-LEVEL compositional anti-patterns. How mechanisms combine badly:

- "Beautiful book cover attached to blank pages" -- all interest in first 30%
- "Wall of cards" -- same component type repeated 10+ times
- "Footnote cemetery" -- bottom third becomes a dump of small text
- "Header hero, body zero" -- elaborate header, bland content zones
- "Grid desert" -- single-column throughout when content demands variety

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: ANTI-PATTERN LIST IN CONVENTIONS BRIEF**

These are binary prohibitions (Tier 1 encoding -- survive any compression):

```
COMPOSITIONAL ANTI-PATTERNS (if any is true, STOP and restructure):

AP-1: FRONT-LOADING -- More than 40% of designed moments are in the first scroll quartile.
AP-2: WALL-OF-CARDS -- Same component type used more than 5 consecutive times.
AP-3: CEMETERY -- Final 25% of page contains zero designed moments or components.
AP-4: HERO-BODY-GAP -- Header zone has >= 4 mechanisms; first content zone has <= 1.
AP-5: GRID-DESERT -- Zero multi-column layouts in a page with >= 3 content sections.
AP-6: UNIFORM-TYPE -- All body text uses identical font-size/weight (no per-zone variation).
```

Each is testable, binary, and self-contained. They survive compression because they are prohibitions with measurable thresholds.

### Verification

- **Programmatic gate:** Each anti-pattern can be checked by counting mechanisms per scroll quartile, components per sequence, etc. Binary per pattern.
- **Post-build check:** All 6 anti-patterns absent. If any present: builder restructures before final audit.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Compositional imbalance.** The page may achieve high mechanism count but deploy them badly -- all in one zone, all of one type, or all in the header. The overall PA-05 score suffers not because mechanisms are absent but because they are MALDISTRIBUTED. Anti-patterns catch distribution failures that mechanism count alone misses.

## MISSING CONCEPT 12: CROSS-PAGE COHERENCE

**Type:** MISSING (family resemblance across pages)
**Classification:** SPECIFIED (soul constraints) + EMERGENT (compositional personality)

### What It Is

All current concepts address a SINGLE page. But a design system builds multiple pages. Cross-page coherence addresses:
- Family resemblance: a reader who has seen 3 pages should detect consistent personality
- Same soul, different expression: each page has unique metaphor but shared vocabulary
- Compositional personality: how mechanisms are TYPICALLY deployed (density arc, component density, rhythm)

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: SOUL CONSTRAINTS + CONVENTIONS BRIEF (already exists)**

1. **Soul constraints as cross-page identity:** The identity layer (border-radius: 0, warm palette, typography trinity, 3-tier border system) already provides cross-page vocabulary coherence. These are Tier 1 encodings that survive any compression and produce consistent visual identity across pages.

2. **Conventions brief as compositional personality:** The density arc (Opening -> Building -> Climax -> Resolution), the signal-to-silence ratio, the perception thresholds -- these are the COMPOSITIONAL personality that makes all KortAI pages feel related even when their content and metaphors differ.

3. **What is NOT specified:** Each page's metaphor is unique (derived from content). Each page's mechanism deployment is unique (driven by content-form coupling). The "same soul, different expression" principle means pages share vocabulary and arc but not specific compositions.

4. **Case study references:** The builder receives access to 1-2 case study pages (e.g., CD-006, Gas Town). These serve as CALIBRATION examples -- "this is what a KortAI page feels like" -- not templates. The anti-prescription framing is critical: "these are proof-of-concept, NOT templates. Do not copy their structure."

### Verification

- **Programmatic gate:** Soul constraints (border-radius: 0, palette compliance, typography compliance) verified. Binary.
- **Perceptual gate (across pages):** "If you saw this page alongside [existing page], would they feel like siblings?" Fresh-eyes assessment.

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Brand fragmentation or template monotony.** Without cross-page coherence: each page feels like a different design system (no family resemblance). With too much: every page looks identical (template monotony). The balance is soul-level consistency (same vocabulary, same arc, same warmth) with composition-level variety (different metaphors, different mechanism combinations, different designed moments).

## MISSING CONCEPT 13: REVISION QUALITY

**Type:** MISSING (maintaining composition across edits)
**Classification:** ACTIVATED (revision recipe) + EMERGENT (edit quality)

### What It Is

All current concepts concern the FIRST BUILD. But real pages get revised. Revision quality addresses:
- Adding content to an existing zone without breaking multi-coherence
- Changing the metaphor without rebuilding from scratch
- Maintaining compositional fluency across revisions by different builders
- Preventing degradation from DESIGNED to ASSEMBLED through cumulative edits

### Pipeline v3 Mechanism

**Primary mechanism: REVISION PROTOCOL (appended to conventions brief)**

1. **Zone-aware editing rule:** "When adding content to an existing zone, inherit that zone's background, typography, and spacing values. Do not introduce new token values that aren't in the original zone's vocabulary."

2. **Multi-coherence preservation check:** "Before and after any content addition, verify that zone boundaries still have >= 3 channel shifts. If adding content within a zone breaks a boundary's coherence, adjust the new content to maintain the shift."

3. **Metaphor preservation instruction:** "All revisions must serve the existing pervading metaphor. If the revision cannot fit within the metaphor, the page may need a metaphor revision (which is a full rebuild, not a patch)."

4. **Revision mode = COMPOSING, not REPAIRING:** "When revising, read the full page first to understand its compositional architecture. Then add content as a COMPOSING act (designing the addition to integrate with the whole), not a REPAIRING act (inserting content and hoping it fits)."

### Verification

- **Post-revision gate:** Run the same PA and programmatic gates on the revised page. Scores must not decrease by more than 0.5 on any dimension.
- **Post-revision perceptual check:** "Does the revised page feel like ONE composition or a BASE with patches?"

### Risk if This Concept Fails

**Design debt accumulation.** A page that was DESIGNED (4/4) in its first build degrades to ASSEMBLED (3/4) after 3 revisions, then to FUNCTIONAL (2.5/4) after 6 revisions, as each edit patches without compositional awareness. This is the web equivalent of technical debt -- compositional debt that makes the page progressively harder to maintain and progressively less coherent.

### The Core Design Principle

**The pipeline SPECIFIES what can be encoded as Tier 1-2, ACTIVATES what requires COMPOSING mode through document format and framing, and creates CONDITIONS for what must EMERGE from the builder's compositional judgment.**

- 6 concepts are primarily SPECIFIED (binary rules, closed vocabularies, measurable thresholds)
- 5 concepts are primarily ACTIVATED (dispositional instructions, recipe format, world-description)
- 2 concepts are primarily EMERGENT (emotional arc, metaphor embodiment)

No concept relies on a single mechanism type. Even the most SPECIFIED concepts (compression physics) include activation elements (format hierarchy enforcement activates proper encoding habits). And even the most EMERGENT concepts (emotional arc) are enabled by specified conditions (peak-valley thresholds create the rhythm from which emotion can emerge).

The dominant principle: **compression physics determines what CAN survive the pipeline. Builder cognitive mode determines whether what survives gets COMPOSED or merely COMPLIED with. The 13 concepts are the complete vocabulary of what the pipeline must address -- no more, no less.**

*13 irreducible concepts mapped to concrete pipeline mechanisms. 6 SPECIFIED, 5 ACTIVATED, 2 EMERGENT. The funnel architecture (3 preconditions -> 1 gatekeeper -> capabilities) maps directly to pipeline phases (analysis -> pre-flight -> brief assembly -> TC derivation -> building). The largest insight: the 6 missing concepts (temporal, reader, emotional, anti-patterns, cross-page, revision) are not missing from the RESEARCH -- they are missing from the PIPELINE. Reports 28, 45, 46, 51, and 56 describe them thoroughly. The pipeline simply has no mechanism to address them. This map provides those mechanisms.*

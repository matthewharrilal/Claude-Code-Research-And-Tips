# A6: Flagship + Intervention Cluster Audit (Reports 54-59)

**Auditor:** cluster-auditor (Opus 4.6)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Task:** #29 -- Synthesis cluster audit of the Flagship + intervention reports
**Reports Audited:** 54 (CD-006 deficit), 55 (Flagship crystallization), 48 (second crystallization), 56 (concept independence), 57 (compositional fluency deep), 58 (dispositional recipe), 59 (suppressor archaeology)

---

## 0. CLUSTER OVERVIEW

These 6 reports (plus Report 48, a second crystallization) define WHAT Flagship IS and HOW to get there. They form the most actionable cluster in the handoff corpus -- moving from diagnosis (54: what CD-006 lacks) through theory (55/48: what Flagship looks like) through mechanism analysis (56: irreducible concepts, 57: fluency registers) to intervention design (58: dispositional recipe, 59: suppressor removal).

The cluster's central claim: **Flagship 4/4 is achievable through a ~73-100 line prompt combining suppressor removal + positive scaffolding + dispositional framing, delivered to Opus as sole builder.**

This audit tests whether the 6 reports AGREE with each other, whether their proposals are COMPATIBLE, and whether any SELF-CONTRADICTIONS undermine the intervention package.

## 1. DOES THE CD-006 DEFICIT ANALYSIS (54) AGREE WITH FLAGSHIP CRYSTALLIZATION (55) ON WHAT'S MISSING?

### Framework Alignment: STRONG but not identical

**Report 54's framework:** 14-dimension scoring + 7 deficit categories
- 7 deficits: no unified metaphor (D-13), local multi-coherence only (D-04), vocabulary not composition (J-01), generic transitions (D-02), uniform density (pacing), zero silence zones (G-05), PA rubric cannot detect Flagship (measurement)

**Report 55's framework:** 7 experiential properties + 5 missing dimensions
- 7 properties: unified metaphor governance, compositional fluency (CCS >= 0.30), emotional arc, content-form resonance (metaphor-mediated), semantic restraint, 5-second squint test, terminal craft
- 5 missing dimensions: M-01 atmospheric conviction, M-02 CCS >= 0.30, M-03 emotional arc, M-04 content-form resonance, M-05 grand spatial pause

**Report 48's framework:** 3 defining properties + 3 new dimension candidates
- 3 properties: unified multi-channel semantic direction, compositional memory across full scroll, content-form indistinguishability
- 3 candidates: D-15 temporal pacing, D-16 content-form resonance score, D-17 builder invention score

### Points of AGREEMENT:

1. **Unified pervading metaphor is THE critical gap.** All three reports identify this as deficit #1. Report 54 scores it as FAIL on D-13 with 2/4 gates. Report 55 devotes Section 4 to showing exactly what structural metaphor looks like in CSS. Report 48 calls it Property 1 (unified multi-channel semantic direction).

2. **Multi-coherence must be global, not local.** Report 54 counts 1-2 genuine instances (vs 3+ required). Report 55 devotes Viewports 5-6 to showing how multi-coherence manifests at every boundary. Report 48 calls this "sustained multi-coherence through the MIDDLE."

3. **Density arc / emotional arc is missing.** Report 54 identifies uniform density (~55-65% throughout). Report 55 specifies the scroll rhythm (arrival -> engagement -> climax -> release). Report 48 proposes D-15 (temporal pacing) as a new dimension.

4. **Content-form resonance is a separate property.** Report 54 does not name it explicitly (subsumed under intentionality). Report 55 names it as M-04. Report 48 elevates it to Property 3 (content-form indistinguishability).

### Points of DIVERGENCE:

1. **Report 54 frames the gap as STRUCTURAL (14 dimensions, pass/fail). Report 55 frames it as EXPERIENTIAL (what the reader feels viewport-by-viewport).** These are complementary, not contradictory. But the framing difference matters for intervention design: Report 54 implies the fix is hitting dimensional thresholds; Report 55 implies the fix is creating an experience. The dispositional recipe (Report 58) sides with Report 55's experiential framing.

2. **Report 48 adds "compositional memory" as Property 2, which neither 54 nor 55 names.** Compositional memory = "design decisions made in the first viewport echo, evolve, and resolve in the final viewport." Report 54 mentions bookending (header/footer echo) and the S1/S8 spiral return, but does not generalize to a page-wide memory property. Report 55 describes this in Viewports 11-12 (page ASCENDS back through strata) but does not name it separately. This is a genuinely new concept that may be important.

3. **CCS values differ.** Report 54 estimates CD-006 at CCS ~0.15-0.20. Report 57 measures it at CCS ~0.40 using a more rigorous removal test. This 2x discrepancy matters -- if CD-006 is at 0.40, it is already at "structural coupling" (Register 2), not near the vocabulary/composition boundary. The discrepancy arises from different counting methods: Report 54 counts each mechanism individually (18 mechanisms, most independent). Report 57 counts functional clusters (header chain, density cluster) and weighs strong/medium/weak coupling. **Report 57's methodology is more rigorous.** I recommend accepting CCS ~0.40 for CD-006.

### VERDICT: Reports 54, 55, and 48 are COMPATIBLE. They view the same gap through different lenses (structural, experiential, concrete). The intervention package must address all three perspectives. The CCS discrepancy should be resolved in favor of Report 57's ~0.40.

---

## 2. CONCEPT INDEPENDENCE (56) vs COMPOSITIONAL FLUENCY (57): COMPATIBLE FRAMEWORKS?

### Report 56's framework: 7 primitives from 40 concepts
P-1 Builder Cognitive Mode, P-2 Model Capability, P-3 Content-Form Coupling, P-4 Interference Physics, P-5 Compositional Fluency, P-6 Pervading Metaphor, P-7 Peak-Valley Rhythm

### Report 57's framework: 3 registers of compositional fluency
Register 1 (Local, CCS 0.15-0.35), Register 2 (Structural, CCS 0.35-0.55), Register 3 (Atmospheric, CCS 0.55-0.80)

### Compatibility Analysis

**Question:** Does Report 57 use the same 7 primitives or a different framework?

Report 57 focuses exclusively on P-5 (Compositional Fluency) and treats it as multi-register. It mentions P-6 (Pervading Metaphor) as a necessary complement ("fluency without metaphor produces local coherence, not global"). It implicitly relies on P-1 (Builder Cognitive Mode) via the "procedural vs dispositional recipe" distinction. But it does not reference P-2 (Model), P-3 (Content-Form), P-4 (Interference), or P-7 (Peak-Valley) -- these are treated as separate concerns.

**Are the 7 primitives consistent with the 3 registers?**

YES, with a mapping:
- Register 1 (local coupling) = P-5 at minimum activation. No metaphor needed (P-6 absent).
- Register 2 (structural coupling) = P-5 + partial P-6 (bookending, weight-response chains require page-scale awareness but not full metaphor).
- Register 3 (atmospheric coupling) = P-5 + P-6 + P-7 fully engaged. The atmospheric register requires ALL mechanisms governed by one metaphor (P-6) with deliberate peak-valley rhythm (P-7).

**The insight:** Report 56's primitives are the COMPONENTS; Report 57's registers are the COMPOSITIONS of those components. Register 3 is not a separate concept -- it is P-5 + P-6 + P-7 operating as an integrated system. This is exactly what Report 56's dependency graph predicts: P-5 (Fluency) requires both P-6 (Metaphor) and P-7 (Peak-Valley) to produce quality.

### Minor Framework Gap

Report 56 identifies 12 irreducible concepts (7 primitives + 5 applications). Report 57 uses "13 irreducible concepts" nowhere -- it focuses solely on compositional fluency. The task description mentions "7+6=13 irreducible concepts" -- this appears to be referencing 56's 7 primitives + 5 applications + 1 missing primitive (P-8 Temporal Quality) = 13 total. The frameworks are compatible but Report 57 does not validate or invalidate the full 12+1 count; it only deep-dives into P-5.

### VERDICT: COMPATIBLE. Report 57's 3 registers are compositions of Report 56's primitives. Register 3 = P-5 + P-6 + P-7 fully engaged. No contradictions.

---

## 3. CAN SUPPRESSOR REMOVAL ALONE REACH REGISTER 3?

This is the audit's most critical question.

### What Report 59 claims:
- All suppressors removed + soul constraints only = 3.0-3.5/4
- Adding 73 lines of positive scaffolding = 3.5-4.0/4
- Suppressor removal accounts for 70-80% of the quality gap

### What Report 57 claims:
- Register 3 (CCS 0.55-0.80) has NEVER been achieved
- Register 3 requires: component-level modulation by zone, grid choice as compositional decision, silence zones, dispositional recipe
- Value tables can specify Registers 1-2.5; Register 3 requires dispositional recipe + COMPOSING mode

### The Question: Does 3.0-3.5/4 correspond to Register 2 or Register 3?

**Analysis:**
- Middle experiment = PA-05 4/4, CCS ~0.10-0.15, Register 1. DESIGNED quality through vocabulary, not coupling.
- Gas Town = CCS ~0.45-0.55, Register 2.5. COMPOSED quality with strong density arc but no component modulation.
- CD-006 = CCS ~0.40, Register 2. Ceiling quality through structural coupling.

Report 59's prediction of 3.0-3.5/4 with suppressor removal aligns with Register 2-2.5 (Gas Town level). This is CONSISTENT with Report 57's claim that Register 3 has never been achieved -- suppressor removal alone does NOT reach Register 3.

**But there is a tension:** Report 59 says +73 lines of scaffolding pushes to 3.5-4.0/4. Report 57 says Register 3 requires dispositional recipe. The 73-line scaffolding includes "structural metaphor instruction (~10 lines)" and "density arc concept (~10 lines)" but does NOT include the 5 dispositional instructions from Report 58. If Report 57 is right that Register 3 requires dispositional framing, then Report 59's 73-line scaffolding is INCOMPLETE -- it provides the technical frameworks but not the cognitive-mode activation.

### Resolution:

The two reports are measuring DIFFERENT quality properties:
- Report 59 measures PA-05 score (perceptual audit verdict: 1.5/4, 2.5/4, 3.0/4, 4.0/4). PA-05 measures the OVERALL designed quality impression.
- Report 57 measures CCS (compositional coupling score). CCS measures mechanism interdependence specifically.

A page can score 4/4 on PA-05 without hitting Register 3 CCS. The Middle experiment proves this: PA-05 4/4 at CCS ~0.10-0.15. PA-05 measures PERCEIVED design quality, which includes vocabulary, restraint, content-form resonance, and atmospheric conviction -- not just coupling.

**Therefore:** Suppressor removal + 73-line scaffolding could plausibly reach PA-05 3.5-4.0/4 WITHOUT reaching Register 3 CCS. The quality would come from freed native capability (perceptual variety, aesthetic judgment, content-sensitive decisions) rather than from systematic mechanism coupling. This is CONSISTENT with both reports.

**But Flagship-as-defined requires Register 3.** Report 55 specifies CCS >= 0.30 as M-02 (missing dimension). Report 57 defines Register 3 as the Flagship floor. If Flagship is the target, suppressor removal + scaffolding produces DESIGNED quality (PA-05 3.5-4.0) that may or may not be Flagship (depends on whether the builder's freed judgment happens to produce atmospheric coupling).

### VERDICT: No contradiction, but a CLARIFICATION needed. Suppressor removal reaches 3.0-3.5/4 on PA-05 (Register 2-2.5 CCS). Adding scaffolding pushes to 3.5-4.0/4 on PA-05 but may not reach Register 3 CCS without the dispositional recipe from Report 58. The 73-line minimal set should be augmented with Report 58's Tier 4 (12 lines) to form a ~85-line complete intervention.

---

## 4. ARE THE DISPOSITIONAL RECIPE (58) AND SUPPRESSOR MINIMAL SET (59) COMPATIBLE?

### Report 58's proposal: 50-line hybrid recipe
- Tier 1: Hard Physics (15 lines -- binary constraints)
- Tier 2: Build Sequence (15 lines -- procedural steps)
- Tier 3: CSS Vocabulary (8 lines -- specific values)
- Tier 4: Disposition (12 lines -- how to be while building)

### Report 59's proposal: 73-line minimal constraint set
- Identity (15 lines -- soul constraints)
- Calibration (8 lines -- perception thresholds)
- Framework (50 lines -- multi-coherence, metaphor, density arc, content-form, creative authority)

### Compatibility Check

**Overlap analysis:**

| Report 58 | Report 59 | Overlap? |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Tier 1: Hard Physics (15 lines) | Identity (15 lines) | IDENTICAL scope -- both are soul constraints |
| Tier 3: CSS Vocabulary (8 lines) | Calibration (8 lines) | PARTIAL overlap -- 58 gives CSS values, 59 gives thresholds. Both serve calibration. |
| Tier 2: Build Sequence (15 lines) | Not present in 59 | 58 ADDS procedural sequencing |
| Tier 4: Disposition (12 lines) | Not present in 59 | 58 ADDS dispositional framing |
| Not present in 58 | Framework (50 lines) | 59 ADDS multi-coherence, metaphor, density frameworks |

**The proposals are COMPLEMENTARY, not competing.** Report 58's Tiers 1+3 (~23 lines) overlap with Report 59's Identity+Calibration (~23 lines). Report 58 adds procedural and dispositional layers that 59 lacks. Report 59 adds compositional framework content that 58 lacks.

**The MERGED proposal would be:**

| Layer | Source | Lines |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Tier 1: Identity/Hard Physics | Both (overlap) | ~15 |
| Tier 2: Build Sequence | Report 58 | ~15 |
| Tier 3: CSS Vocabulary + Calibration | Both (merged) | ~10 |
| Framework: Multi-coherence, metaphor, density arc | Report 59 | ~35 |
| Tier 4: Disposition (D-01 through D-05) | Report 58 | ~12 |
| **TOTAL** | | **~87 lines** |

This 87-line merged proposal is between Report 58's 50 lines and Report 59's 73 lines, and more complete than either alone.

### One STRUCTURAL TENSION:

Report 58 argues Tier 4 (disposition) should come LAST (builder reads constraints first, then procedures, then vocabulary, THEN disposition). Report 58 also proposes restructuring the conventions brief to put creative authority at BOTH ends (primacy + recency).

Report 59 does not address ordering. Its 73-line set is organized by type (identity -> calibration -> framework) without any positional argument.

These are compatible -- the content can be ordered either way. But the ORDERING matters for builder cognition (Report 58's argument is persuasive that Tier 4 should come after Tiers 1-3).

### VERDICT: COMPATIBLE and COMPLEMENTARY. The two proposals merge cleanly into an ~87-line unified intervention. No conflicts.

---

## 5. DO THE FLAGSHIP CRYSTALLIZATION'S 3 DEFINING PROPERTIES GET ADDRESSED BY THE INTERVENTIONS?

### Report 55's 7-point crystallization (Section 10):
1. Single pervading metaphor governs ALL CSS decisions
2. Mechanisms compositionally fluent (CCS >= 0.30)
3. Emotional arc (arrival -> engagement -> climax -> release -> closure)
4. Content-form resonance is metaphor-mediated
5. Restraint is semantic (absence is composed)
6. 5-second squint test (rhythmic light/dark banding visible at 25% zoom)
7. Terminal craft present (typography varies by zone, footer echoes header, etc.)

### Report 48's 3 defining properties:
1. Unified multi-channel semantic direction
2. Compositional memory across full scroll
3. Content-form indistinguishability

### What the interventions address:

| Property | Report 58 (Dispositional) | Report 59 (Suppressor Removal) | ADDRESSED? |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 1. Pervading metaphor | D-01 ("feel the register") indirectly encourages metaphor engagement | Framework includes "structural metaphor instruction (~10 lines)" | PARTIALLY -- instruction to derive metaphor exists, but no mechanism ensures it is STRUCTURAL (40% without labels) |
| 2. Compositional fluency CCS >= 0.30 | Not directly addressed | Multi-coherence framework (~30 lines) provides the coordinated-shift concept | PARTIALLY -- framework teaches the concept; achieving CCS 0.30+ requires builder execution |
| 3. Emotional arc | D-04 ("second half should earn the first half") | Density arc concept (~10 lines) | YES -- between D-04's designed-moment requirement and the density arc framework |
| 4. Content-form resonance | D-01 ("feel the emotional register of each section") | Content-form coupling instruction (~5 lines) | YES -- D-01 is THE dispositional instruction for this |
| 5. Semantic restraint | D-03 ("if invisible at 100% zoom, delete it") | Suppressor removal eliminates S-04 (sub-perceptual emphasis) and S-05 (absence rationalization) | YES -- D-03 directly activates restraint-as-quality |
| 6. Squint test | D-05 ("scroll the page as a reader") | Not directly addressed | PARTIALLY -- D-05 activates perceptual checking but the squint test specifically is not mentioned |
| 7. Terminal craft | Tier 4 general composing mode | Suppressor removal frees cognitive budget for details | PARTIALLY -- neither report specifically instructs terminal craft; it is expected to emerge from freed capability |
| Property 2 from 48 (compositional memory) | D-04 mentions "second half earning first half's promise" | Framework's bookending and density arc concepts | PARTIALLY -- bookending addressed, but broader compositional memory (echoes at multiple points) not specifically instructed |
| Property 3 from 48 (content-form indistinguishability) | D-01 directly addresses this | Content-form coupling instruction | YES |

### GAP ANALYSIS:

**FULLY ADDRESSED (3/10):** Emotional arc, content-form resonance, semantic restraint.

**PARTIALLY ADDRESSED (6/10):** Pervading metaphor (instruction exists but structural manifestation not guaranteed), compositional fluency CCS (framework teaches concept but execution uncertain), squint test (D-05 activates perceptual checking but squint not named), terminal craft (expected to emerge), compositional memory (bookending addressed but broader echoes not), content-form indistinguishability (D-01 addresses but "indistinguishable" is a very high bar).

**NOT ADDRESSED (1/10):** None completely missing, but pervading metaphor achieving the 40% structural-without-labels test is the most uncertain.

### VERDICT: The interventions address all 3+7 properties to some degree but leave the HARDEST property (structural metaphor embodiment) to the builder's judgment. This is CONSISTENT with the emergence thesis (Report 48 Section 5B: "producible conditions, emergent quality") but means Flagship is PROBABILISTIC, not guaranteed. The reports correctly estimate 45-55% probability of near-Flagship on first attempt.

---

## 6. IF THE PIPELINE IS NET-NEGATIVE, IS ADDING MORE (DISPOSITIONAL RECIPE) HELPFUL?

### The Apparent Contradiction

Report 59 (Section 7, Finding 2): "The pipeline's net effect on a builder is NEGATIVE. The builder would produce BETTER output with just soul constraints + 70 lines of framework than with the full 963-line master prompt."

Report 57 (Section 3.4): "Value tables can specify Registers 1-2.5; Register 3 requires dispositional recipe."

Report 58 (Section 7): "A dispositional recipe does not CREATE capability. It ACTIVATES capability that already exists."

**The question:** If MORE instruction is the problem, how is ADDING a dispositional recipe the solution?

### Resolution: Volume vs Type

The contradiction dissolves when you distinguish VOLUME from TYPE:

- Report 59 says the pipeline's VOLUME is net-negative (963 lines overwhelm the builder)
- Report 58 says the pipeline's TYPE is net-negative (checklist format triggers compliance mode)
- Report 58's dispositional recipe is not "adding more" -- it is REPLACING the type

The merged intervention is ~87 lines, not ~963 + 87 = 1,050. The dispositional recipe REPLACES the master prompt, not supplements it. The reduction from 963 to 87 lines IS the suppressor removal. The dispositional framing IS the type change.

Report 59's crossover curve (Part 5) makes this explicit: below 3.2/4, the intervention is REMOVING (suppressor removal). Above 3.2/4, the intervention is ADDING (positive scaffolding). The ~87-line merged proposal operates at the crossover point -- it removes ~890 lines of suppressive content while adding ~87 lines of enabling content. NET change: -876 lines. This is removal, not addition.

### The Deeper Question: Does ANY instruction help above 3.2/4?

Report 59 estimates that Opus with soul constraints only produces 3.0-3.5/4. Adding 73 lines pushes to 3.5-4.0/4. The 73 lines provide capabilities Opus does NOT natively possess:
- Multi-coherence (coordinated channel shifts) -- not in Opus training data
- Perception thresholds (15 RGB minimum) -- Opus produces 1-8 RGB without this
- Structural metaphor derivation -- Opus produces generic editorial without this

These are CALIBRATION and FRAMEWORK, not SPECIFICATION. They tell Opus "here is a concept you don't know" (multi-coherence) and "here is a number you need" (15 RGB), not "here is what to do" (write background-color: #F5F2EC for Zone 3).

Report 58's dispositional instructions (D-01 through D-05) are similarly not specification -- they are PERCEPTUAL SHIFT INSTRUCTIONS that redirect attention from compliance to composition. They do not add rules; they change how the builder relates to the task.

### VERDICT: No contradiction. The pipeline is net-negative because of VOLUME and TYPE (963 lines of checklist). The intervention is net-positive because it REPLACES the volume+type with 87 lines of enabling content. The dispositional recipe is not "more pipeline" -- it is "different architecture entirely."

---

## 7. THE SELF-CONTRADICTION TEST: LESS vs MORE

### The Apparent Contradiction

The reports collectively recommend:
- **(a) Remove suppressors** -- LESS specification (Report 59)
- **(b) Add value tables** -- MORE specification of specific CSS values (Report 57)
- **(c) Add dispositional recipe** -- MORE instruction about HOW TO BE (Report 58)

If less is better (a), why add more (b, c)?

### Resolution: Three Different Dimensions

The contradiction is a category error. "Less" and "more" refer to different types of content:

| Type | Direction | Example | Why |
|------|-----------|---------|-----|
| **Prohibitions/constraints** | REMOVE (less) | "FAIL IF background delta < 15 RGB" | Triggers defensive processing |
| **Calibration values** | ADD (more) | "Background delta >= 15 RGB between zones" | Provides factual knowledge Opus lacks |
| **Dispositional framing** | ADD (more) | "Before writing CSS, feel the section's register" | Activates native capability |

The apparent "more" of (b) and (c) is a different KIND of content from the "less" of (a):

- (a) removes DEFENSIVE content (55 prohibitions, 21 count-gates, checklist format, 900+ lines of guardrails)
- (b) adds KNOWLEDGE content (specific CSS values, perception thresholds, multi-coherence concept)
- (c) adds ACTIVATION content (perceptual shift instructions that unlock native judgment)

This maps to Report 58's 4-tier structure:
- Tier 1 (identity constraints) = RETAINED from (a) -- the irreducible hard physics
- Tier 2 (build sequence) = NEW from (c) -- procedural scaffold
- Tier 3 (CSS vocabulary) = NEW from (b) -- calibration values
- Tier 4 (disposition) = NEW from (c) -- activation instructions

The NET effect: ~890 lines REMOVED (defensive), ~87 lines ADDED (knowledge + activation) = dramatic reduction in total instruction volume AND a type shift from defensive to enabling.

### Quantitative Check

Report 59's interference model: `quality = f(model_capability - instruction_interference)`

- 963-line prompt: interference dominates. Quality = capability - HIGH interference = 1.5/4
- 87-line prompt: interference minimal. Quality = capability - LOW interference = 3.5-4.0/4
- 0-line prompt: no interference, but no system knowledge. Quality = capability - 0 interference + 0 system knowledge = 2.5-3.0/4 (generic editorial)

The 87-line prompt sits at the optimum: enough system knowledge to exceed generic Opus output, little enough interference to not suppress native capability.

### VERDICT: No self-contradiction. The reports recommend LESS of one type (defensive specification) and MORE of another type (calibration + activation). The net instruction volume drops from 963 to 87 lines. The type shifts from defensive to enabling. This is internally consistent.

---

## 9. UNRESOLVED TENSIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONS

### Tension 1: CCS Threshold for Flagship

Report 55 proposes M-02: CCS >= 0.30 for Flagship. Report 57 says Register 3 starts at CCS >= 0.55. CD-006 at CCS ~0.40 is classified as CEILING (not Flagship) by both reports. So is the Flagship CCS threshold 0.30 (Report 55) or 0.55 (Report 57)?

**Resolution attempt:** Report 55's M-02 (>= 0.30) is a MINIMUM FLOOR for Flagship candidacy. Report 57's Register 3 (>= 0.55) is the CHARACTERISTIC range for true Flagship. A page at CCS 0.35 with a strong pervading metaphor and emotional arc might pass M-02 but not reach Register 3. Whether that page is "Flagship" depends on whether we define Flagship by the floor (0.30) or the characteristic range (0.55+).

**Recommendation:** Use 0.30 as the ENTRY threshold and 0.55 as the FULL Flagship marker. Pages in the 0.30-0.55 range are "Flagship-adjacent" -- they have compositional intent but not full atmospheric coupling.

### Tension 2: Single Builder vs Creative Revision Cycle

Report 55 (Section 8) argues the highest-leverage intervention is the CREATIVE REVISION CYCLE: a fresh Opus agent reads the build and provides compositional feedback, breaking continuation bias. Report 58 proposes D-05 (experiential scroll) as a self-revision mechanism. Report 59's single-builder model (suppressor removal + 73 lines) implies single-pass.

Are these compatible? Report 58's D-05 is a SINGLE-AGENT self-revision (the builder scrolls its own work). Report 55's creative revision is a TWO-AGENT critique cycle. They address the same problem (continuation bias) at different intensities. D-05 is the lightweight version; the critique cycle is heavyweight.

**Recommendation:** Include D-05 in the base recipe. Add the critique cycle as an OPTIONAL second pass for Flagship-priority pages. The critique agent would be a fresh Opus instance that receives only the rendered HTML and provides 5-10 compositional observations. This does NOT add specification -- it adds a reader's perspective.

### Tension 3: Report 48's "Builder Invention Score" (D-17)

Report 48 proposes that Flagship requires >= 3 CSS patterns NOT in the mechanism catalog that the builder invented for THIS content. This is in tension with Report 59's suppressor removal thesis, which argues the builder should be freed from the catalog's constraints, not required to invent beyond it.

**Resolution:** D-17 is a MEASUREMENT, not a SPECIFICATION. It measures whether the builder composed for THIS content (inventions present) or merely deployed catalog vocabulary (no inventions). Including D-17 as a measurement in PA Tier 5 questions is compatible with suppressor removal -- the builder's freed capability should naturally produce inventions.

### Open Question 1: Has the 73-line hypothesis been tested?

No. Report 59 acknowledges this: "The 73-line minimal set is a CONCRETE, TESTABLE hypothesis." None of the 6 reports provide empirical validation. The entire intervention package is theoretical, grounded in retrospective analysis of past builds but not forward-tested.

### Open Question 2: Does Report 56's P-8 (Temporal Quality / Animation) matter?

Report 56 identifies temporal quality (animation, interaction, motion) as the missing 8th primitive. The other 6 reports ignore it entirely. The design system's soul prohibitions limit animation. But hover states, scroll reveals, and transition timing could contribute to Flagship quality. This is a genuine blind spot across all reports.

### Open Question 3: Is Flagship a discrete register or a continuum?

Report 57 proposes 3 registers with boundaries. The contrarian in the Flagship 4/4 recipe research challenged whether Flagship 4/4 is a discrete register at all. If quality is continuous (not discrete), the entire Flagship/Ceiling/Middle taxonomy may be a useful approximation that does not map to reality. The 6 reports assume discrete tiers.

## 10. THE MERGED INTERVENTION: SYNTHESIS RECOMMENDATION

Based on the cross-reference audit, the intervention package that emerges from Reports 54-59 is:

### Architecture: 4-Tier Hybrid (~87 lines)

**Tier 1: Identity Constraints (15 lines)**
Source: Reports 58 + 59 (overlapping)
Content: 10 soul prohibitions (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none, etc.)
Function: Prevent catastrophic identity failure

**Tier 2: Build Sequence (15 lines)**
Source: Report 58
Content: 8-step procedural scaffold (read content -> read catalog -> write conviction -> build HTML -> build CSS boundary-by-boundary -> midpoint scroll -> answer 5 questions -> run gates)
Function: Reduce cognitive load through sequencing

**Tier 3: Calibration + Vocabulary (10 lines)**
Source: Reports 58 + 59 (merged)
Content: 4 perception thresholds + 6 lines of CSS value reference (backgrounds, borders, typography)
Function: Provide knowledge Opus lacks natively

**Tier 3b: Compositional Framework (35 lines)**
Source: Report 59 (framework section)
Content: Multi-coherence concept (coordinated channel shifts), structural metaphor instruction (derive from content, embody in CSS), density arc (opening/deepening/resolving), content-form coupling, creative authority (80/20)
Function: Teach compositional concepts not in Opus training data

**Tier 4: Disposition (12 lines)**
Source: Report 58
Content: D-01 (feel register before writing CSS), D-02 (perceive room change at boundaries), D-03 (delete invisible CSS), D-04 (create second-half peak), D-05 (scroll as reader, revise what feels wrong)
Function: Activate native compositional judgment

### Ordering (per Report 58's argument):
1. Tier 1 (constraints close bad options)
2. Tier 2 (procedures reduce cognitive load)
3. Tier 3 + 3b (vocabulary + frameworks provide materials)
4. Tier 4 (disposition activates judgment to USE 1-3 compositionally)

### Expected Outcomes (combining all 6 reports' estimates):
- PA-05: 3.5-4.0/4 (DESIGNED) -- Report 59's prediction with enhanced scaffolding
- CCS: 0.35-0.55 (Register 2 to approaching Register 3) -- depends on builder engagement with Tier 4
- Flagship dimensions: 11-13/14 (pervading metaphor is the highest-variance dimension)
- P(4/4 DESIGNED): 45-55% on first attempt (Report 55's estimate)
- P(Flagship 14/14): 20-30% on first attempt (Report 55's estimate)

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Opus as builder.** All 6 reports converge on this. Sonnet + disposition is unpredictable (Report 58 Section 2).
2. **Content with structural heterogeneity.** Report 56's P-3 (Content-Form Coupling). All-prose content caps quality.
3. **Single-pass or single-pass + critique.** Not multi-pass multi-agent (that produced 1.5/4).

## 11. FINAL VERDICT ON THE CLUSTER

### Coherence: 8/10
The 6 reports are remarkably consistent for independent investigations. The CCS discrepancy (54 vs 57) is the only direct contradiction, and it resolves in favor of 57's more rigorous methodology. The frameworks (7 primitives, 3 registers, 4-tier recipe, suppression chains) are complementary rather than competing.

### Completeness: 7/10
The cluster covers WHAT Flagship is (54, 55, 48), WHY it hasn't been achieved (57, 59), and HOW to get there (58, 59). Missing: empirical validation (no forward test), temporal quality (P-8), and detailed critique-cycle protocol (mentioned but not designed).

### Actionability: 9/10
The merged ~87-line intervention is concrete, testable, and immediately executable. Reports 58 and 59 provide line-count-level specificity. The ordering argument (58) and suppression chain analysis (59) give clear rationale for every inclusion and exclusion.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Model-dependence (HIGH):** Opus is required. If Opus is unavailable or too expensive, the intervention degrades to ~3.0/4 with Sonnet (Report 58's graceful degradation).
- **Non-reproducibility (MEDIUM):** PA-05 scores will vary from 3.0 to 4.0 across runs (Report 58 Risk 1). This is inherent in the dispositional approach and is managed by accepting quality bands rather than fixed targets.
- **Untested (MEDIUM):** The entire package is theoretical. The 73-line (or 87-line) hypothesis has never been forward-tested.

### The Single-Sentence Summary:

**Reports 54-59 converge on a coherent, internally consistent intervention: replace the 963-line suppressive master prompt with an ~87-line enabling hybrid recipe (15 identity + 15 procedure + 45 calibration/framework + 12 disposition), delivered to Opus as sole builder, producing an estimated 45-55% chance of DESIGNED (3.5-4.0/4) and 20-30% chance of full Flagship (14/14 dimensions) on first attempt.**

# Dimension 08: PA + Weaver Evaluation Fidelity

**Auditor:** Opus agent (pa-weaver-fidelity)
**Runs examined:** Molly Panopticon (2026-03-02), Yegge Gas Town (2026-03-02)
**Artifacts per run:** 5 auditor reports, 1 synthesis, 1 comparison report, 1 fix feedback, 6 screenshots, final HTML

## A. Fresh-Eyes Fidelity

### Evidence of Genuine Fresh-Eyes Perception

**Strong evidence of genuine fresh-eyes in BOTH runs.** The auditors consistently describe what they SEE before interpreting what it MEANS. Key indicators:

1. **Molly Run -- Auditors describe from raw perception:**
   - Auditor 1: "like being handed a classified document in a dimly lit room"
   - Auditor 2: "a dark, heavy slab filling the top of the screen"
   - Auditor 4: "like being handed a sealed file in a windowless room"
   - Auditor 5: "the sensation of accessing something guarded and serious"

2. **Yegge Run -- Auditors describe from raw perception:**
   - Auditor 1: "a dark shelf at the top anchors something that feels like an old, well-made technical book"
   - Auditor 2: "like I'm opening a well-made technical notebook -- dark cover, warm pages"
   - Auditor 3: "opening a serious, well-made technical manual"
   - Auditor 4: "like cracking open a well-made technical book at the first chapter"

**Contamination indicators: MIXED.** No auditor uses pipeline vocabulary ("soul checklist," "mechanism catalog," "zone architecture," etc.). However, a subtle contamination signal exists: the Molly auditors describe a "cartographic survey station metaphor" and zone names (THE CARTOUCHE, THE SURVEY GRID, THE LEGEND, TERRA INCOGNITA) -- but these are visible in the HTML itself as section labels, so the auditors are reading what is on the page rather than importing pipeline knowledge. Similarly, Yegge auditors reference zone labels visible in the content. **Verdict: no contamination detected beyond what the pages themselves present.**

### Language Quality: Experiential vs. Analytical

**Strongly experiential.** The reports are dominated by embodied, sensory language rather than design jargon:

- "the page breathes most generously" (Molly A1)
- "I hear a warm acoustic bass" (Yegge A1)
- "the silence after someone says something important" (Molly A4)
- "like stepping from a dark theater into a sunlit room" (Molly A1)
- "a page that spent its spatial generosity early and had to ration it toward the end" (Molly A1)
- "a patient, slightly intense senior engineer who pulls you aside at a conference" (Yegge A3)
- "like a song that ends on a held note vs one where someone unplugs the amplifier" (Yegge A4)

**Design jargon is nearly absent.** No instances of: "whitespace," "padding," "margin," "typography system," "color palette," "responsive breakpoint," "grid system." The closest approach to technical language is Molly Auditor 3's "barcode" metaphor for the dark-light stacking pattern, which is a perceptual observation, not a design term.

### Report Depth: Substantive vs. Thin

**Substantive across all 10 auditors.** Every assigned question receives a multi-paragraph answer that engages with the specific visual experience rather than offering generic observations.

**Strongest substantive moments:**
- Molly A2's E-14 (Rhythm): The metronomic analysis tracks the beat of the page across its full length, with specific observations about where syncopation is missing.
- Yegge A4's E-04 (Empty Space): Distinguishes between space-as-designed-pause (opening) and space-as-absence (ending) with genuine perceptual precision.
- Yegge A1's E-17 (Voice): The acoustic bass metaphor is sustained through an entire analysis of tempo variation. This is not a throwaway comparison -- the auditor builds on it.

**Weakest substantive moments:**
- Molly A4's E-20 (One Change): While the suggestion is good, it is the shortest report in the Molly set at 45 lines. It covers only 2 questions where others cover 4.
- Yegge A5's E-09 (Form Coupling): Slightly generic in its middle section where it describes code blocks "growing longer" without the same perceptual specificity as other auditors.

### Average Report Lengths

| Run | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | A5 | Average |
|-----|----|----|----|----|-----|---------|
| Molly | 57 | 59 | 79 | 45 | 63 | **60.6 lines** |
| Yegge | 91 | 111 | 93 | 101 | 93 | **97.8 lines** |

**Yegge auditors wrote 61% more per report than Molly auditors.** This may reflect that Yegge auditors were assigned to the first (pre-fix) evaluation round while Molly auditors in the surviving files are re-evaluation reports. Re-evaluation auditors may write more tersely because they are updating prior observations rather than writing from scratch. Alternatively, the Yegge content (technical deep-dive with code blocks) may have given auditors more concrete visual features to discuss.

## B. Auditor Convergence

### Molly Run: Convergence Map

**5/5 CONVERGE on:**
- The opening header is the page's strongest moment (decorative serif title, dark field, red label)
- The dark-light alternation becomes monotonous/predictable through the middle third
- The page is extremely long and the design does not evolve across its length
- REFINE verdict

**4/5 CONVERGE on:**
- The metadata row at the bottom of the header is too clinical/dim (A1, A2, A4, A5)
- The dark bands lose their emphasis power through repetition (A1, A2, A3, A4)

**3/5 CONVERGE on:**
- A "third register" or additional visual mode is needed (A1, A3, A4)
- The bottom third partially recovers but does not feel like a designed conclusion (A2, A3, A5)

**DIVERGENCE:**
- Auditor 3 explicitly identifies "barcode" shape language and calls for tiered emphasis within dark bands. No other auditor frames it as a shape-vocabulary problem.
- Auditor 5 uniquely identifies the zone names (THE CARTOUCHE, etc.) as creating a "station" metaphor that adds architectural meaning the text alone could not convey.
- Auditor 1 specifically identifies the "two-thirds mark" where dark bands cluster as the page's worst moment. Auditors 2 and 4 describe similar fatigue but locate it more diffusely in "the middle."

### Yegge Run: Convergence Map

**5/5 CONVERGE on:**
- The opening sequence (header through Complexity Ladder) is the strongest moment
- The dark code blocks become monotonous through the middle third
- The two-beat rhythm (warm prose / dark code) becomes predictable before the page is half over
- REFINE verdict

**4/5 CONVERGE on:**
- The full-width dark band (Beads/chapter break) is the most powerful structural moment after the opening (A1, A2, A3, A5)
- The page's design energy is front-loaded; the middle and end receive less compositional attention (A1, A2, A3, A4)

**3/5 CONVERGE on:**
- The code blocks do not differentiate between trivial and complex content (A1, A3, A5)
- The page does not signal progress or position within its length (A1, A2, A4)

**DIVERGENCE:**
- Auditor 3 uniquely frames the page as "one shape, one move" -- a geometric monotony argument.
- Auditor 4 uniquely focuses on empty space quality, distinguishing between "designed pauses" and "machine running at one speed."
- Auditor 2 is the only one to identify a specific mismatch between the decorative heading font's formality and the content's conversational voice.

### Convergence Assessment: Genuine Pattern or Groupthink?

**Genuine perceptual pattern, not groupthink.** Three lines of evidence:

1. **Independent language.** The 5 Molly auditors use strikingly different metaphors for the same phenomenon: "hallway with evenly spaced doors" (A4), "barcode" (A3), "cello and its own shadow" (A1), "lights alternate between on and off" (A2). If groupthink were operating, metaphors would converge as well as conclusions.

2. **Verifiable against screenshots.** I examined the full-page screenshots for both runs. The Molly page at 1440px shows a clear, visible pattern of ~20+ dark horizontal bands against a cream background. The bands do genuinely become denser in the middle third. The Yegge page shows ~37 dark code blocks with similar clustering. The auditors are describing what is physically visible in the images.

3. **Divergent fix recommendations.** While all auditors agree on the problem (monotonous rhythm), they recommend different solutions: vary dark band weight (A3), vary dark band timing (A4), add a third register (A1/A5), break the pattern entirely with a layout shift (A2). Groupthink would produce convergent solutions, not just convergent diagnosis.

**One concern:** The Cold Look verdicts are unanimously REFINE in both runs (10/10). While justified by the evidence, this unanimity raises a question about whether auditors are calibrated toward REFINE as a safe default. I would expect at least one contrarian SHIP or REJECT in a group of 5 if the verdict distribution were truly independent. This pattern is consistent across both runs and warrants monitoring in future pipeline runs.

## C. Weaver Synthesis Quality

### Output Completeness

| Output | Molly | Yegge |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 1. Experience Portrait | YES | YES |
| 2. Creative Direction (AMPLIFY/RELEASE/DEEPEN) | YES | YES (AMPLIFY/RELEASE/DEEPEN + "THE GAP") |
| 3. Verdict | YES (SHIP) | YES (SHIP) |
| 4. Package Compliance | YES (section-by-section) | YES (section-by-section) |

**Both Weavers produce all 4 required outputs.** The Yegge Weaver adds a non-standard "THE GAP" section within Creative Direction that identifies the highest-leverage missing element -- this is a creative addition beyond the template.

### Experience Portrait Quality

**Molly Weaver -- Genuinely experiential.** The portrait opens with "This page opens with the same commanding dark threshold..." and sustains embodied language throughout. Key quality markers:
- "The professor has put on a warmer tie and paused more thoughtfully before the final conclusion, but the lecture itself remains a single sustained note." -- This is prose, not analysis.
- Tracks the scroll experience in physical terms: "thousands of pixels," "the page becomes abandoned rather than spacious."
- Honestly acknowledges where fixes helped ("the improvements are real but local") and where they did not transform the experience.

**Yegge Weaver -- Also genuinely experiential, with stronger structural precision.** The portrait tracks the code-minor differentiation with specific counts ("24 of 37 code blocks now wear a lighter treatment") while maintaining an experiential frame ("the reader feels the surfacing"). The closing metaphor -- "a knowledgeable teacher who has learned to vary the volume of their exhibits" -- directly builds on the auditors' convergent "teacher" characterization.

**Both portraits avoid a trap:** they do not merely summarize auditor observations. They synthesize into a unified narrative that adds the Weaver's own perceptual assessment. The Molly Weaver's scroll-through narrative explicitly states "I notice..." at several points where it introduces observations not present in any individual auditor report.

### AMPLIFY Items: Specificity and Protectiveness

**Molly AMPLIFY (5 items):**
1. Dark header -- cites "Five auditors, across two evaluation rounds, unanimously identify it." Strong evidence base.
2. Annotations zone register shift -- cites specific CSS treatments (tan background, indented margins, reduced font, adversarial red critique). **CSS-specific.**
3. Legend's color-coded symbol key -- cites "56px spacing, the Instrument Serif italic quotes." **CSS-specific.**
4. Philosophical-pause treatment -- cites "warm-shifted background with left border accent." **Mechanism-specific.**
5. Pre-terra transition -- structural but less CSS-specific.

**Yegge AMPLIFY (4 items):**
1. Opening sequence through Complexity Ladder -- "protect it absolutely." Strong protective language.
2. `.code-minor` differentiation -- cites "24 of 37 blocks... 13 full-dark anchors." **CSS-specific with exact counts.**
3. Beads dark zone -- cites "three auditors independently flagged it."
4. Post-Beads decompression -- cites "80px padding, 2rem zone-opener heading, expanded first-paragraph line-height (1.85)." **Highly CSS-specific.**

**Assessment:** AMPLIFY items are well-evidenced and protective. Both Weavers cite specific CSS properties and auditor convergence counts. The Yegge Weaver is particularly strong at grounding AMPLIFY items in measured values. **The AMPLIFY sections would function as effective refine-builder guardrails** -- a builder receiving these would know exactly what not to touch.

### Verdict Justification

**Both verdicts are SHIP after Fix Cycle 1.** Both are justified by structured reasoning:

**Molly verdict reasoning:** Walks through all 7 pre-fix issues, confirms each was addressed, identifies the remaining issue as TYPE C (compositional), argues that a second fix cycle carries risk of overcrowding, and concludes "the improvement would be incremental, not transformational." This is a well-reasoned cost-benefit analysis.

**Yegge verdict reasoning:** Lists 5 pre-fix issues with resolution status (4 resolved, 1 partially), classifies remaining concerns as "polish opportunities, not compositional failures," and provides a one-paragraph summation of what the page achieves. Equally well-reasoned.

**One concern with both verdicts:** Both Weavers inherited auditor populations that unanimously said REFINE on re-evaluation -- yet the Weavers overrode to SHIP. The reasoning is sound in both cases (the remaining issues are diminishing-returns polish, not structural failures), but this pattern means the Weaver is making a judgment call that contradicts 5/5 auditors. This is appropriate -- the Weaver should have authority to override -- but the override should be more explicitly flagged. Neither Weaver directly states "I am overriding the auditor consensus."

## D. Package Compliance (Output 4)

### Section-by-Section Assessment

**Molly Weaver -- YES, section-by-section.** Covers Sections 0-8 individually, with per-section compliance status (FOLLOWED / PARTIALLY FOLLOWED / NOT FOLLOWED), CSS evidence citations, and gap diagnoses. Tracks NOVEL vs STANDARD separately:
- Pre-fix: NOVEL 23/26 (88%), STANDARD 9/9 (100%). 6/9 sections fully followed, 3/9 partial, 0/9 not followed.
- Post-fix: NOVEL 10/13 (renormalized tracking), STANDARD 6/6 (100%). 5/9 fully, 4/9 partial, 0/9 not.

**Yegge Weaver -- YES, section-by-section with extensive CSS evidence.** Each section cites specific CSS line numbers, property values, and HTML class names. The assessment is remarkably detailed:
- Post-fix: NOVEL 15/15 (100%), STANDARD 7/7 (100%). 9/9 sections fully followed.
- Explicitly notes where fix cycle diverged from package specifications (Zone 4 and 6 padding increased from 64px to 80px) and classifies these as "justified creative divergence."

### NOVEL vs STANDARD Tracking

**Both Weavers track separately.** The distinction is meaningful:
- STANDARD instructions achieve 100% compliance in both runs. These are binary constraints (border-radius: 0, no gradients, locked palette) that are trivially verifiable.
- NOVEL instructions show the real variation. Molly's 88% pre-fix NOVEL compliance dropped to a renormalized tracking after fix. Yegge achieved 100% NOVEL compliance post-fix.

### Evidence Quality

**Molly compliance assessment: EVIDENCE-BASED but less CSS-specific than Yegge.** The Molly comparison report cites "CSS line 139: `border-radius: 0`" and specific hex values, but several compliance judgments are more structural ("zone architecture unchanged and still matches the metaphor") without quoting specific property values.

**Yegge compliance assessment: DEEPLY EVIDENCE-BASED.** Almost every claim cites a specific CSS property, value, and sometimes line number. Example: "Universal reset applies `border-radius: 0` and `box-shadow: none` on `*, *::before, *::after`." The Yegge Weaver's compliance section is the strongest analytical output across both runs.

### Lowest-Scoring Sections

**Molly:**
- Section 2 (Mechanism Selections) -- PARTIALLY FOLLOWED. Specific gaps: paragraph `margin-bottom` 20px vs specified 24px; zone-level border-weight gradient not deployed.
- Section 5 (Case Study Processes) -- PARTIALLY FOLLOWED. OD-004 zone-level certainty borders dropped.
- Section 8 (Structural Propositions) -- PARTIALLY FOLLOWED. Proposition 1 (survey deepens) too subtle; Proposition 5 (Terra Incognita arrival) dulled.

**Yegge:** All 9 sections FOLLOWED post-fix. The highest-impact remaining gap is code block FREQUENCY in middle zones, which the Weaver classifies as "PACKAGE UNCLEAR" -- the package addressed adjacency and uniformity but not total exhibit count. This is a sophisticated diagnosis that distinguishes builder failure from package gap.

### Comparison Report Quality

**Both comparison reports are functional and well-structured.** The Molly report is extracted from synthesis Output 4 and presented as a standalone file with per-section verdicts, compliance percentages, and a "Diagnosis" section. The Yegge report is a concise summary version that tracks pre-fix to post-fix improvement (5/9 to 9/9 sections followed). Both serve their purpose as quick-reference compliance summaries.

## E. Fix Cycle Trigger and Resolution

### What Triggered REFINE?

**Molly first-round synthesis (inferred from re-evaluation synthesis references):**
The re-evaluation synthesis references 7 issues from the first synthesis:
1. Metronomic dark/light alternation (TYPE B)
2. Subtitle text too dim (TYPE A)
3. No background variation within cream zones (TYPE A)
4. Front-loaded energy / bottom third underserved (TYPE B)
5. Metadata row clinical (TYPE A)
6. Missing third visual register (TYPE B)
7. Heading typeface at body scale (TYPE A)

Classification: 4 TYPE A (mechanical), 3 TYPE B (structural), 0 TYPE C.

**Yegge first-round synthesis (inferred from fix feedback):**
5 gaps identified:
1. Dark code block monotony (TYPE A)
2. Weak decompression after Beads (TYPE B)
3. Bridge transitions too weak (TYPE A)
4. Bottom-third energy fade (TYPE B)
5. PULSE width contrast insufficient (TYPE A)

Classification: 3 TYPE A, 2 TYPE B, 0 TYPE C.

### Was REFINE Justified?

**YES in both cases.** The auditor evidence is overwhelming and convergent:

**Molly:** 5/5 auditors identify rhythmic monotony as the dominant weakness. The screenshots confirm the visual pattern. The specific issues (dim subtitle, clinical metadata, missing third register) are all verifiable against the screenshots and represent genuine perceptual deficits.

**Yegge:** 5/5 auditors identify code-block uniformity and middle-third fatigue. The screenshots show 37 dark code blocks of identical visual weight. The Beads decompression issue is visible in the full-page screenshot where the post-dark-zone section opens with insufficient breathing room.

### Fix Feedback Quality

**Molly fix feedback (100 lines):** Highly structured. Each of the 7 issues receives a named section with specific CSS changes (hex values, pixel values, new custom properties). The "What Was Preserved" section explicitly protects AMPLIFY items. The "Dark Bands: Kept vs Converted" table is a model of clarity -- the builder diagnosed that the monotony came from cream-zone sameness, not dark-band excess, and explains this reasoning. The "Third Visual Register Description" section introduces the philosophical-pause mechanism with exact CSS values. Three remaining concerns are transparently flagged. **This is an excellent fix feedback document.**

**Yegge fix feedback (51 lines):** More concise but equally precise. Each of 5 gaps receives a named paragraph with CSS changes. The `.code-minor` classification decision (24 of 37 blocks reclassified) is explained with criteria (line-count and content-type). The "What Was Preserved" section is shorter but covers the same ground. Three remaining concerns flagged. **This is a good fix feedback document, slightly less thorough than Molly's.**

### Did Fixes Address Weaver Concerns?

**Molly:** All 7 issues received direct CSS changes. The fix cycle's most innovative move -- the `.philosophical-pause` treatment -- directly responds to the "missing third register" concern. However, the Weaver's re-evaluation notes that the mechanism was deployed only once ("one deployment demonstrates the mechanism... the restraint that makes sense for a short page becomes underdeployment on a page this long"). The fix partially addressed the concern but not fully.

**Yegge:** All 5 gaps received direct CSS changes. The `.code-minor` differentiation was the highest-impact fix, reclassifying 24/37 blocks to lighter treatment. The re-evaluation auditors shifted their complaint from "all the same" (uniformity) to "still a lot of them" (frequency) -- confirming the fix changed the nature of the problem. The Zone 4 decompression (80px padding + 2rem heading + 1.85 line-height) directly addressed the weak surfacing after Beads.

---

## Cross-Run Patterns and Overall Assessment

### What Works Well

1. **Fresh-eyes protocol is genuinely effective.** 10/10 auditors across both runs demonstrate perceptual language without pipeline contamination. The metaphors are varied, specific, and grounded in what the screenshots actually show.

2. **Auditor convergence identifies real perceptual patterns.** The convergence in both runs is on the same phenomenon (rhythmic monotony from repetitive structural patterns) verified against screenshots. Different auditors reach the same conclusion through different perceptual pathways.

3. **Weaver synthesis adds genuine value beyond aggregation.** Both Weavers contribute their own perceptual assessment, produce structured creative direction with CSS-specific AMPLIFY items, and make reasoned verdict judgments that override auditor consensus with transparent reasoning.

4. **Package compliance is evidence-based and rigorous.** Both Weavers track NOVEL vs STANDARD separately, cite specific CSS evidence, and distinguish between builder divergence and package gaps. The Yegge Weaver's diagnosis of "PACKAGE UNCLEAR" for the code-block frequency issue is a sophisticated analytical move.

5. **Fix cycles produce targeted, well-documented improvements.** Both fix feedback files are structured, cite exact CSS changes, protect AMPLIFY items, and flag remaining concerns.

### What Needs Attention

1. **Unanimous REFINE verdicts (10/10) raise calibration concerns.** In two runs with different content, all 10 auditors said REFINE. While justified in both cases, this unanimity suggests auditors may be calibrated toward REFINE as a safe default. A well-built page should occasionally produce at least one SHIP from a fresh-eyes auditor. Consider: is the question battery biased toward finding weaknesses? (Questions like E-11 "fighting content" and E-19 "almost working" explicitly probe for problems.)

2. **Weaver override of auditor consensus is not explicitly flagged.** Both Weavers moved from auditor-unanimous REFINE to SHIP without directly stating "I am overriding 5/5 auditor recommendations." The reasoning is sound but the override should be more visible for pipeline transparency.

3. **Report length disparity between runs.** Molly auditors averaged 60.6 lines; Yegge auditors averaged 97.8 lines (61% more). This may indicate that the re-evaluation context (Molly reports are labeled "Re-evaluation") produces shorter reports, or that the question assignments happened to generate different depths. Standardizing report length expectations could improve consistency.

4. **Both pages suffer from the same perceptual weakness.** Rhythmic monotony from repetitive structural patterns (dark bands for Molly, dark code blocks for Yegge) was the dominant finding in both runs. This is not a PA failure -- the PA correctly identified it in both cases. But it suggests the upstream build phase has a systematic tendency toward binary rhythm that the PA consistently catches but that one fix cycle cannot fully resolve.

5. **Pre-fix synthesis files are not preserved.** Only post-fix (re-evaluation) versions of auditor reports and synthesis survive in the `_pa/` directory. The pre-fix versions were presumably overwritten. For audit purposes, both should be archived (e.g., `_pa/pre-fix/` and `_pa/post-fix/`).

### Quality Scores

| Dimension | Molly | Yegge | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Fresh-eyes fidelity | 9/10 | 9/10 | Strong perceptual language, no contamination detected |
| Auditor depth | 7/10 | 9/10 | Yegge auditors significantly longer and more detailed |
| Convergence quality | 9/10 | 9/10 | Independent diagnosis with varied metaphors |
| Weaver portrait | 8/10 | 9/10 | Both experiential; Yegge more structurally precise |
| Creative direction | 9/10 | 9/10 | AMPLIFY items CSS-specific and protective |
| Verdict reasoning | 8/10 | 8/10 | Sound but override not explicitly flagged |
| Package compliance | 7/10 | 10/10 | Yegge deeply evidence-based; Molly less CSS-specific |
| Fix cycle quality | 9/10 | 9/10 | Both targeted, well-documented, preserve AMPLIFY items |
| **Overall** | **8.3/10** | **9.0/10** | Both strong; Yegge Weaver is the higher-quality evaluation |

### Summary

The PA + Weaver evaluation system is working well. Fresh-eyes perception is genuine, auditor convergence identifies real perceptual patterns verified against screenshots, Weaver synthesis adds value beyond aggregation, and fix cycles produce targeted improvements. The primary concerns are: (1) unanimous REFINE calibration suggesting possible question-battery bias, (2) Weaver override of auditor consensus should be more transparently flagged, (3) pre-fix artifacts should be preserved for auditability. The Yegge run's PA evaluation is slightly higher quality than the Molly run's, driven primarily by longer auditor reports and more CSS-specific package compliance assessment.

# Adversarial Methodology Review — Extraction Epistemology

**Agent:** adversarial-reviewer
**Task:** #6 — Challenge ALL Wave 1 extraction assumptions
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Method:** Cross-reference 5 Wave 1 lenses + 2 prior research syntheses, find divergences, gaps, methodology flaws

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After reading all Wave 1 lens outputs and prior extraction research, I have identified **14 critical gaps, 7 methodology conflicts, and 3 fundamental counting errors** that undermine prior extraction estimates.

### The Devastating Finding

**ALL prior counts (45/18/12/8) are EPISTEMOLOGICALLY INVALID because they mixed incompatible ontologies.**

The "true extraction inventory" claims:
- 45 tokens
- 18 components
- 12 mechanisms
- 8 patterns

But these categories **operate at different abstraction levels and can't be added together**. It's like counting "3 colors + 4 brushes + 2 painting techniques + 1 aesthetic movement = 10 extractables."

**The real question is: What SHOULD be extracted FOR WHAT PURPOSE?**

Wave 1 lenses reveal that **extraction is NOT a discovery process (finding what exists) but a DECISION PROCESS (choosing what to preserve based on values).**

---

## 1. WHERE LENSES CONVERGE (High Confidence Core)

### 1.1 Universal Agreement (ALL 5 lenses)

**SOUL TOKENS (3 items) — Absolute Consensus:**

```css
border-radius: 0;     /* All 5 lenses: MUST extract */
box-shadow: none;     /* All 5 lenses: MUST extract */
--color-primary: #E83025;  /* All 5 lenses: MUST extract */
```

**Evidence:**
- **Fresh-extraction:** "Completely sharp corners (zero rounded edges anywhere)"
- **Lens-derivation:** "Soul pieces are eternal (rigidity is the POINT)"
- **Reuse-lens:** "100% frequency — UNIVERSAL"
- **Enablement-lens:** "Prevents identity violations"
- **Identity-lens:** "Breaking these breaks identity"

**Convergence strength:** 5/5 lenses, zero disagreement

**Why this matters:** These 3 are THE ONLY items with perfect cross-lens consensus. Everything else has lens-dependent extractability.

### 1.2 Strong Convergence (4/5 lenses agree)

**CORE COLOR PALETTE (11 colors):**
- Background cream (#FEF9F5)
- Text soft-black (#1A1A1A)
- 5 accent colors (blue/green/coral/amber/purple)
- 3 zone backgrounds

**Agreeing lenses:** Reuse (100% frequency), Enablement (non-derivable), Identity (signature warmth), Fresh (saw everywhere)
**Dissenting lens:** Lens-derivation (argues PALETTE is extractable but specific hex values are parameters, not essence)

**TYPOGRAPHY TRINITY (3 fonts):**
- Instrument Serif (display)
- Inter (body)
- JetBrains Mono (code)

**Agreeing lenses:** Reuse (100% frequency), Identity (editorial voice), Enablement (specific fonts non-derivable), Fresh (observed everywhere)
**Dissenting lens:** Lens-derivation (argues HIERARCHY is extractable, specific fonts are implementation)

**2-ZONE CALLOUT DNA:**
- Sparse label zone (uppercase, mono)
- Dense body zone (larger text)
- 4px left border accent

**Agreeing lenses:** Fresh (saw on every page), Reuse (100% frequency), Identity (compositional soul), Enablement (archetypal structure)
**Dissenting lens:** Lens-derivation (argues PATTERN is extractable but callout as component is over-specified)

### 1.3 Moderate Convergence (3/5 lenses)

**SPACING SCALE (14 values, 4px base unit):**
- Agreeing: Reuse (universal), Enablement (anchor values), Identity (spatial system)
- Dissenting: Fresh (called it "obvious"), Lens-derivation (argues only PRINCIPLE extractable)

**CODE BLOCK (dark theme component):**
- Agreeing: Fresh (saw repeatedly), Reuse (90% frequency), Identity (flat aesthetic)
- Dissenting: Enablement (argues generic, not KortAI-specific), Lens-derivation (implementation not essence)

**EXPLORATION HEADER (dark full-bleed):**
- Agreeing: Reuse (100% frequency), Identity (page anatomy), Fresh (saw on all pages)
- Dissenting: Enablement (pattern not component), Lens-derivation (too specific)

---

## 2. WHERE LENSES DIVERGE (Methodology Artifacts)

### 2.1 The Component Count Wars

**Prior estimate:** 18 components (from true-extraction-inventory)

**What each lens ACTUALLY extracted:**

| Lens | Component Count | What It Counted |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Fresh-extraction** | ~20 items | Visual patterns (including compositional) |
| **Lens-derivation** | 9 generative primitives | Meta-patterns + constraint frameworks |
| **Reuse-lens** | 42-45 patterns | CSS rules + HTML structures + layouts |
| **Enablement-lens** | 7 archetypes | Minimum viable for creative freedom |
| **Identity-lens** | 29 identity-bearing | Soul + compositional + semantic |

**The divergence is NOT about counting errors. It's about WHAT COUNTS AS A COMPONENT.**

**Examples of the ontology clash:**

- **Callout system:**
  - Reuse-lens counts: 1 base component + 5 semantic variants = 6 items
  - Enablement-lens counts: 1 archetypal structure (variants are color parameters)
  - Identity-lens counts: 1 compositional grammar
  - Fresh-extraction counts: 6 visual component types

**Same artifact, 4 different counts (1, 1, 6, 6) depending on ontology.**

- **Spacing scale:**
  - Reuse-lens counts: 14 individual token values
  - Enablement-lens counts: 6 anchor values (rest derivable)
  - Lens-derivation counts: 1 constraint framework (4px base unit principle)
  - Identity-lens counts: 3-level gestalt semantic system

**Same artifact, 4 different counts (1, 3, 6, 14).**

### 2.2 The Frequency Trap

**Reuse-lens claims:** "42-45 patterns based on 30%+ frequency threshold"

**But this mixes incompatible categories:**

| Reuse Item | Category Type | Other Lenses Say |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| `:root token block` | Implementation file | NOT a component, it's a container |
| `Callout system (5 types)` | Component family | 1 component with 5 parameters, not 5 components |
| `Skip-link accessibility` | Standard web practice | Enablement-lens: NOT extractable (generic) |
| `Reduced motion media query` | Browser API usage | Enablement-lens: Copy-paste boilerplate |
| `Print styles` | Output format | NOT part of design system identity |

**The problem:** Reuse-lens counted "things that appear frequently" without distinguishing:
- **Identity-bearing** (soul constraints)
- **Hygiene** (accessibility, performance)
- **Implementation artifacts** (file structures)
- **Standards compliance** (reduced motion, skip links)

**Reuse-lens's 42-45 estimate includes ~15-20 items that other lenses reject as "not extractable."**

### 2.3 The Enablement Minimalism

**Enablement-lens claims:** "~102 lines total extraction"

**But this assumes:**
1. Agents have general design knowledge (true for typography hierarchy)
2. Agents won't violate soul without prohibition (FALSE — they default to rounded corners)
3. Derivable patterns don't need documentation (conflicts with reuse evidence)

**Example conflicts:**

**Skip-link pattern:**
- Enablement-lens: "Obvious from general knowledge, skip extraction"
- Reuse-lens: "100% frequency, extract"
- Identity-lens: "Not identity-bearing but necessary hygiene"
- **Prior research (true-extraction):** Found 0/13 implementation files had skip-link → NOT obvious

**File tree component:**
- Enablement-lens: "Agents can derive monospace + tree characters"
- Reuse-lens: "60% frequency, extract"
- **Prior research (implementation audit):** File-tree exists but needs work → complex enough to warrant extraction

**The problem:** Enablement-lens underestimates what agents will derive INCORRECTLY without examples.

### 2.4 The Identity Overcount

**Identity-lens claims:** "29 identity-bearing extractions"

**But includes items other lenses reject:**

| Identity Item | Other Lenses Challenge |
|---------------|----------------------|
| "Anti-complexity principle" | Lens-derivation: Philosophy not extractable code |
| "Research-first methodology" | All lenses: Process not design system |
| "Perceptual depth over decoration" | Lens-derivation: Implicit in soul constraints |
| "Mono-label pattern" | Enablement: Derivable from examples |
| "Zone backgrounds (3 standard)" | Reuse: Only 60% frequency, not universal |

**The problem:** Identity-lens mixed PHILOSOPHY (anti-complexity) with IMPLEMENTATION (3-category borders).

Philosophy informs extraction decisions but isn't itself extractable.

---

## 3. WHAT PRIOR EXTRACTION MISSED

### 3.1 Gaps in "True Extraction Inventory" (45/18/12/8)

**MISSED: Responsive Strategy Beyond 768px**

**Evidence:**
- Fresh-extraction: "Saw padding adjusts at smaller widths"
- Reuse-lens: "Single 768px breakpoint observed"
- Identity-lens: "Requires validation: responsive behavior (saw desktop only)"

**Prior research (true-extraction) said:** "Responsive behavior (saw desktop only)" but then counted 768px as THE breakpoint.

**Gap:** No mobile testing (375px), no tablet testing (1024px). The 768px might be ONE OF SEVERAL, not the canonical breakpoint.

**MISSED: Dark Mode Token Overrides**

**Evidence:**
- Prior research explicitly said: "Dark mode approach — No dark mode implementations observed."
- But extraction-architecture research includes dark mode in Phase C-III

**Gap:** Dark mode is PLANNED but not VALIDATED. Extracting unvalidated patterns.

**MISSED: Table Styling Specifics**

**Evidence:**
- Reuse-lens: "Decision matrix / comparison table — 5/10 files (50% frequency)"
- Fresh-extraction: "Table header styling — saw across Boris, CD-006, DD-001"
- Identity-lens: "Table styling — Clean borders, zebra striping optional"

**Conflict:** "Zebra striping optional" but no documentation of WHEN to use zebra vs not.

**Prior count:** 1 table component
**Actual variance:** At least 2 table types (zebra-striped vs clean), possibly 3 (decision matrix has different structure)

**MISSED: Inline Code Context Rules**

**Evidence:**
- Enablement-lens: "Inline code styling — background + mono font"
- Identity-lens: "Inline code styling — Subtle background, slightly smaller"

**Gap:** WHEN does inline code appear vs code blocks? Prior research doesn't document the decision rule.

**Example from visual audit:** Small code snippets inline, multi-line always blocks. But what's the LINE COUNT threshold?

**MISSED: Callout Semantic Differentiation Rules**

**Evidence:**
- Fresh-extraction: "Variants: Info, Tip, Gotcha, Challenge, Essence, Note"
- Reuse-lens: "Callout types: info, tip, essence, gotcha/challenge, note"
- Identity-lens: "Context (blue), Info (blue), Essence (coral/red), Challenge (purple), Gotcha (coral), Tip (green)"

**Conflict:** Fresh says 6 types, Reuse says 5 types, Identity color-codes don't match Fresh labels.

**Gap:** WHEN to use Info vs Context vs Note (all blue)? Prior research doesn't document semantic rules.

**MISSED: The "Breathing Room" Zones**

**Evidence:**
- Fresh-extraction: "Sparse section: Big heading, one paragraph, lots of whitespace"
- Identity-lens: "Zone backgrounds (3 standard: sparse/dense/breathing)"
- Reuse-lens: "Zone background differentiation — 60% frequency"

**Gap:** What TRIGGERS a breathing-room zone vs dense zone? Content-based rule missing.

**MISSED: Border-Weight Confidence Encoding**

**Evidence:**
- Rigidity-mechanics: "Border-Weight = Confidence — Thickness encodes certainty"
- Prior research (true-extraction): Counted as mechanism but no extraction guidance

**Gap:** If border-weight encodes confidence, what are the SPECIFIC RULES?
- 4px = high confidence?
- 3px = medium?
- 1px = low?

Mechanism documented but usage criteria missing.

### 3.2 Gaps Wave 1 Lenses Exposed

**FRESH-EXTRACTION revealed:**

**Visual patterns invisible in source code:**
- Drop cap on first paragraph (OD-001)
- Progress indicators updating on scroll
- Font loading timing artifacts
- Whitespace compression at mobile widths
- "Islands really look like islands" (metaphor matches perception)

**Prior research counted:** 0 of these patterns (all source-code based)

**Gap:** Visual-only patterns not in extraction inventory.

**LENS-DERIVATION revealed:**

**The lens meta-process itself:**
- 12 possible lenses exist
- Lens choice determines extraction outcome
- Lenses can combine (synergistic) or conflict (antagonistic)

**Prior research assumed:** ONE correct extraction
**Reality:** TWELVE correct extractions depending on worldview

**Gap:** No lens-selection framework. How do you CHOOSE which lens to use?

**ENABLEMENT-LENS revealed:**

**Negative space rules (prohibitions):**
- No 2px borders (prohibition)
- No semi-transparent backgrounds (prohibition)
- Serif NOT for body text (prohibition)
- No rounded corners (prohibition)

**Prior research counted:** Soul constraints as 2 items (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none)
**Enablement found:** 8+ prohibitions not in prior count

**Gap:** Extracting ABSENCES is different from extracting PRESENCES.

**IDENTITY-LENS revealed:**

**Philosophical identity (non-code):**
- Anti-complexity principle
- Research-first methodology
- Perceptual depth over decoration

**Prior research:** Ignored philosophy entirely
**Identity-lens:** "These are identity-bearing even if not CSS"

**Gap:** Is philosophy extractable? How?

---

## 4. WHAT PRIOR EXTRACTION OVER-COUNTED

### 4.1 The Standards Compliance Inflation

**Items counted as extractable that are WEB STANDARDS:**

| Item | Prior Count | Lens Challenge |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Skip-link | Counted (Reuse: 100%) | Enablement: Generic accessibility |
| Focus-visible | Counted (Reuse: 100%) | Enablement: Browser API |
| Reduced motion | Counted (Reuse: 90%) | Enablement: Copy-paste boilerplate |
| Print styles | Counted (Reuse: 70%) | Enablement: Standard practice |

**Reuse-lens defense:** "These appear universally, so extract them for completeness"

**Enablement-lens challenge:** "Agents don't need examples — these are documented web standards"

**Identity-lens verdict:** "Not identity-bearing (hygiene, not character)"

**The over-count:** 4-5 items in "universal extraction" are generic web practices, not KortAI-specific.

### 4.2 The Callout Variant Inflation

**Prior research (reuse-lens) counted:**
- Callout-info
- Callout-tip
- Callout-essence
- Callout-gotcha
- Callout-challenge
- Callout-note

= 6 components

**But these are COLOR PARAMETERS of ONE COMPONENT:**

```css
.callout {
  /* Universal structure */
  border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-color); /* Parameter */
}

.callout--info { --accent-color: var(--accent-blue); }
.callout--tip { --accent-color: var(--accent-green); }
/* ... */
```

**Enablement-lens count:** 1 component (callout DNA)
**Identity-lens count:** 1 compositional grammar
**Lens-derivation count:** 1 constraint framework

**The over-count:** Reuse-lens inflated 1 component to 6 by counting parameter variants.

### 4.3 The Mechanism/Pattern Confusion

**Prior research (true-extraction) categorized:**
- 12 mechanisms (techniques)
- 8 patterns (compositional layouts)

**But several "mechanisms" are actually PATTERN-SPECIFIC:**

| Item | Prior Category | Actual Category |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Depth gradient | Mechanism | Pattern-specific (DD-004 only) |
| Width-encoded density | Mechanism | Pattern-specific (DD-005 only) |
| Border-weight = confidence | Mechanism | Pattern-specific (OD-004 only) |

**Lens-derivation analysis:** These aren't universal techniques — they're PATTERN IMPLEMENTATIONS.

**The over-count:** 3 "mechanisms" are actually one-off pattern artifacts.

### 4.4 The Token Granularity Inflation

**Prior research counted:**
- 14 spacing tokens (space-1 through space-20)

**But enablement-lens argues:**
- 6 anchor values (4, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80)
- Rest are DERIVABLE via 4px increments

**The question:** Is `--space-3: 12px` a separate extractable, or is it `--space-1 * 3`?

**If derivable values aren't extracted:**
- 14 spacing tokens → 6 anchor tokens
- 7 syntax highlighting tokens → 3 core tokens (keyword/string/comment are essential, rest derivable)

**The potential over-count:** 8-10 tokens are arithmetic derivatives, not independent values.

---

## 5. ARE THE CATEGORIES RIGHT?

### 5.1 The Ontology Problem

**Prior research used 4 categories:**
- Tokens (45)
- Components (18)
- Mechanisms (12)
- Patterns (8)

**But these operate at DIFFERENT ABSTRACTION LEVELS:**

```
ABSTRACTION HIERARCHY:
├─ Tokens (values: colors, spacing, fonts)
├─ Mechanisms (techniques: border-weight gradient, 2-zone DNA)
├─ Components (implementations: callout, code block, table)
├─ Patterns (compositions: PULSE, GEOLOGICAL, FRACTAL)
└─ Philosophy (principles: anti-complexity, research-first)
```

**The problem:** You can't ADD these categories together.

**Analogy:**
- 3 paint colors (tokens)
- 2 brush techniques (mechanisms)
- 4 subject types (components: portrait, landscape, still-life, abstract)
- 5 aesthetic movements (patterns: impressionism, cubism, surrealism)

= "14 extractables"? NO. These are LAYERS of a system, not additive items.

### 5.2 The Missing Categories

**Wave 1 lenses revealed categories NOT IN PRIOR RESEARCH:**

**CATEGORY: PROHIBITIONS (Negative Rules)**

From enablement-lens:
- No 2px borders
- No rounded corners
- No drop shadows
- No semi-transparent backgrounds
- Serif NOT for body text
- No gradient backgrounds

**Prior research:** Counted prohibitions inside "soul tokens" (2 items)
**Actual count:** 8+ distinct prohibitions

**CATEGORY: SEMANTIC RULES (When-To-Use)**

From identity-lens + fresh-extraction:
- When to use Info vs Context callout
- When inline code vs code block
- When zebra-stripe tables vs clean
- When to create breathing-room zones

**Prior research:** Assumed these were "obvious from examples"
**Wave 1 finding:** Not documented anywhere

**CATEGORY: COMPOSITIONAL GRAMMAR**

From lens-derivation:
- How to combine components
- Rules for nesting
- Density sequencing principles
- Width variation patterns

**Prior research:** Buried inside "patterns" category
**Actual status:** Separate category (grammar vs layouts)

**CATEGORY: PERCEPTUAL AUDIT CRITERIA**

From identity-lens:
- What makes something "feel like KortAI"
- Soul compliance verification
- Visual coherence checks

**Prior research:** Not in extraction inventory
**Actual status:** Necessary for validation

### 5.3 The Proposed Re-Categorization

**Instead of 4 categories (tokens/components/mechanisms/patterns):**

```
LAYER 1: IDENTITY CONSTRAINTS (Non-negotiable)
├─ Soul geometry: border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none
├─ Soul palette: #E83025, #FEF9F5, warm earth tones
├─ Prohibitions: no 2px, no gradients, no transparency tricks
└─ Typography trinity: Instrument Serif / Inter / JetBrains Mono

LAYER 2: DESIGN VOCABULARY (Reusable atoms)
├─ Color tokens (11 core colors)
├─ Spacing tokens (6 anchors: 4/16/32/48/64/80)
├─ Typography scale (6 levels)
└─ Border categories (4px/3px/1px)

LAYER 3: COMPOSITIONAL GRAMMAR (How to combine)
├─ 2-zone component DNA (label + body)
├─ 3-category border system (structural/data/micro)
├─ Dense/sparse alternation (rhythm principle)
└─ Mechanisms catalog (12 techniques)

LAYER 4: COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATIONS (Concrete patterns)
├─ Callout (with 6 semantic variants)
├─ Code block (dark theme)
├─ Tables (decision matrix variant + clean variant)
├─ Headers, footers, containers
└─ 10-14 total components

LAYER 5: COMPOSITIONAL CASE STUDIES (Not templates)
├─ PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL, FRACTAL
├─ CONVERSATIONAL, NARRATIVE
├─ Documented as PROOF not TEMPLATES
└─ Metaphor-specific, not extractable as layouts

LAYER 6: SEMANTIC DECISION RULES (When-to-use)
├─ Callout type selection (Info vs Tip vs Essence)
├─ Code display choice (inline vs block)
├─ Table styling choice (zebra vs clean)
└─ Density zone triggers
```

**This structure:**
- Separates CONSTRAINTS (Layer 1) from VOCABULARY (Layer 2)
- Distinguishes GRAMMAR (Layer 3) from IMPLEMENTATIONS (Layer 4)
- Isolates EXAMPLES (Layer 5) from DECISIONS (Layer 6)
- Makes abstraction levels explicit

---

## 6. IS THE METHODOLOGY SOUND?

### 6.1 The "Read HTML and Categorize CSS" Approach

**All prior research used:**
1. Read HTML source files
2. Identify CSS patterns
3. Count frequency
4. Extract high-frequency items

**Lens-derivation challenges:** This method FINDS IMPLEMENTATION ARTIFACTS, not DESIGN ESSENCE.

**Evidence:**

**Implementation artifacts counted as extractables:**
- `:root` block structure (file organization, not design system)
- `page-container` max-width (readability standard, not identity)
- Specific nesting depths in fractal demo (teaching tool, not reusable)

**Design essence MISSED by source-code analysis:**
- Visual rhythm (perceived through scrolling, not visible in code)
- Metaphor coherence (boris vault "feels" like archive, not derivable from CSS)
- Perceptual weight (border thickness FEELS intentional)

**Fresh-extraction's approach (visual rendering + source) found:**
- Drop caps (visible rendered, but easy to miss in 1000-line HTML)
- Font loading flicker (runtime behavior)
- Islands metaphor (CSS creates it, but perception validates it)

**The methodology gap:** Prior research was 90% source-code analysis, 10% visual verification.

**Wave 1 optimal:** 50% visual rendering, 50% source analysis.

### 6.2 The Frequency = Extractability Assumption

**Reuse-lens assumes:** High frequency → high extractability

**But lens-derivation shows:** Frequency tells you WHAT repeats, not WHY it's valuable.

**Counter-examples:**

**High-frequency, LOW extractability:**
- Exploration threading headers (100% frequency)
  - All HTML files have provenance headers
  - But these are METADATA, not design system
  - Extraction would be meaningless

**Low-frequency, HIGH extractability:**
- Fractal self-similarity principle (DD-006 only)
  - Appears once
  - But lens-derivation calls it a "generative meta-pattern"
  - Enables infinite compositions

**The methodology flaw:** Frequency measures PAST USAGE, not FUTURE VALUE.

### 6.3 The Single-Context Bias

**All prior research analyzed:**
- Explorations (DD, OD, CD, AD)
- Tension-test layouts (Boris, Gas Town, Playbook)

**But NOT:**
- Production documentation pages (if any exist)
- External applications of the design system
- Non-metaphor-driven content

**Rigidity-mechanics finding:** 75-80% of tension-test files are metaphor-generated.

**Implication:** The extraction inventory is optimized for METAPHOR-DRIVEN CONTENT.

**Gap:** What if content is:
- Data-heavy dashboards (no metaphor)
- API reference documentation (structured, not narrative)
- Marketing pages (different tone)

**The methodology gap:** All analysis is on metaphor-rich explorations. Generalizability unproven.

### 6.4 The Lens-Blindness

**Prior research operated from:**
- Implicit reuse-frequency lens (what appears most)
- Secondary identity lens (what feels like KortAI)

**But lens-derivation shows:** 12 possible lenses exist, each producing DIFFERENT extraction lists.

**The methodology flaw:** Prior research didn't CHOOSE a lens — it DEFAULTED to frequency.

**What should have been done:**
1. Identify all possible lenses (lens-derivation did this)
2. Choose lens based on PURPOSE ("why are we extracting?")
3. Apply chosen lens systematically
4. Document lens-dependent decisions

**What was actually done:**
1. Count frequency (implicit lens)
2. Add identity items (secondary lens)
3. Mix lens outputs without reconciliation

**Result:** The 45/18/12/8 count is a LENS COLLISION, not a coherent extraction.

---

## 7. CONVERGENCE MAP (Confident Core)

Based on cross-lens agreement + prior research validation:

### 7.1 TIER 1: Universal Consensus (Extract These First)

**Soul Constraints (3 items) — 5/5 lenses agree:**
- `border-radius: 0`
- `box-shadow: none`
- `--color-primary: #E83025`

**Evidence:** All lenses + all prior research + 100% visual verification

### 7.2 TIER 2: Strong Convergence (Extract These Second)

**Core Palette (8 colors) — 4/5 lenses agree:**
- Background cream, text soft-black, 5 accents, border tan

**Typography Trinity (3 fonts) — 4/5 lenses agree:**
- Instrument Serif, Inter, JetBrains Mono

**2-Zone Callout DNA (1 pattern) — 4/5 lenses agree:**
- Sparse label + dense body + 4px border

**3-Category Border System (1 framework) — 4/5 lenses agree:**
- 4px structural, 3px accent, 1px micro

**Evidence:** Multi-lens convergence + 90-100% frequency + visual confirmation

### 7.3 TIER 3: Moderate Convergence (Extract with Caution)

**Spacing Anchors (6 values) — 3/5 lenses agree:**
- 4, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80

**Code Block (1 component) — 3/5 lenses agree:**
- Dark theme, syntax highlighting

**Header/Footer (2 components) — 3/5 lenses agree:**
- Dark full-bleed, minimal footer

**Evidence:** Multi-lens convergence but some dissent on specificity

### 7.4 TIER 4: Contested (Research Further Before Extracting)

**Callout Variants (1 vs 6?) — Lens conflict:**
- Enablement/Identity: 1 component with color parameter
- Reuse/Fresh: 6 distinct semantic types

**Spacing Scale (6 vs 14?) — Lens conflict:**
- Enablement: 6 anchors, rest derivable
- Reuse: 14 distinct values

**Components Count (7 vs 18 vs 29?) — Lens conflict:**
- Enablement: 7 archetypes
- Reuse: 18 components
- Identity: 29 identity-bearing

**Patterns Extractability (0% vs 20-40%?) — Lens conflict:**
- Rigidity-mechanics: 0% (75-80% metaphor-generated)
- Prior research: 20-40% (mechanisms extractable)

---

## 8. DIVERGENCE MAP (Methodology-Dependent)

### 8.1 Items ONE Lens Extracts, OTHERS Reject

**Lens-derivation extracts, others skip:**
- Fractal meta-pattern (generative principle)
- Compositional primitives (nesting, scale, rhythm)
- Meta-patterns layer

**Why:** Creative-enablement lens values generative power over literal reuse

**Enablement-lens extracts, others skip:**
- Negative space rules (prohibitions)
- Usage discipline (when NOT to use serif)
- Floor/ceiling constraints (never >80px spacing)

**Why:** Enablement lens extracts CONSTRAINTS to prevent failure

**Identity-lens extracts, others skip:**
- Philosophical principles (anti-complexity)
- Process methodology (research-first)
- Perceptual coherence criteria

**Why:** Identity lens includes NON-CODE aspects

**Reuse-lens extracts, others skip:**
- Skip-link, focus-visible, reduced-motion
- Print styles
- File tree component

**Why:** Frequency lens counts web standards as extractables

**Fresh-lens extracts, others skip:**
- Drop cap pattern
- Progress indicators
- Visual rhythm observations

**Why:** Visual rendering reveals patterns invisible in source

### 8.2 Where Lenses Give OPPOSITE Answers

**Question: Is the spacing scale 6 values or 14?**

- **Enablement:** 6 (rest are derivable via arithmetic)
- **Reuse:** 14 (all appear in code, extract all)
- **Verdict:** DEPENDS on whether "extractable" means "must be provided" or "appears in code"

**Question: Are callout variants separate components or color parameters?**

- **Enablement/Lens-derivation:** Color parameters (1 component)
- **Reuse/Fresh:** Separate semantic types (6 components)
- **Verdict:** DEPENDS on whether semantic differentiation = separate component

**Question: Are patterns extractable?**

- **Rigidity-mechanics:** NO (75-80% metaphor-generated, not templates)
- **Prior research:** YES (20-40% extractable as principles/mechanisms)
- **Verdict:** DEPENDS on whether "extract pattern" means "extract layout" or "extract technique"

---

## 9. CATEGORY CHALLENGE

**Prior categories (tokens/components/mechanisms/patterns) are INCOHERENT because:**

1. **Abstraction mismatch:** Tokens (values) vs Components (implementations) vs Patterns (compositions) are different LAYERS
2. **Additive fallacy:** Can't add 45 tokens + 18 components = 63 extractables (different types)
3. **Missing categories:** Prohibitions, semantic rules, grammar, philosophy
4. **Over-granular:** Callout variants counted as separate components
5. **Under-granular:** All prohibitions counted as 2 items (border-radius, box-shadow)

**Proposed re-categorization:** 6 layers (constraints/vocabulary/grammar/components/case-studies/decisions) — see Section 5.3

---

## 10. METHODOLOGY CRITIQUE

### 10.1 What the Methodology Got Right

**✅ Multi-source triangulation:**
- CSS forensics + HTML audit + Visual rendering + Implementation review
- Cross-referenced findings across 7-8 research outputs

**✅ Frequency analysis:**
- Counting appearances across 39 core + 15 tension-test files
- Identified universal patterns (100% frequency)

**✅ Soul compliance verification:**
- Rigorous auditing of border-radius/box-shadow
- Zero violations found

**✅ Tension-test validation:**
- Proved 75-80% metaphor-generation
- Disproved "patterns as templates" assumption

### 10.2 What the Methodology Got Wrong

**❌ Lens-blindness:**
- Defaulted to frequency lens without conscious choice
- Mixed lens outputs without reconciling ontologies

**❌ Source-code bias:**
- 90% source analysis, 10% visual verification
- Missed visual-only patterns (drop caps, rhythm, perceptual weight)

**❌ Single-context bias:**
- Only analyzed metaphor-driven explorations
- Generalizability to non-metaphor content unproven

**❌ Implementation artifact inflation:**
- Counted file structures (`:root` block), web standards (skip-link), metadata (threading headers)
- Inflated count by 15-20 non-extractable items

**❌ Granularity inconsistency:**
- Counted callout variants as 6 separate (over-granular)
- Counted prohibitions as 2 items (under-granular)
- No principled granularity rule

**❌ Abstraction layer collision:**
- Added tokens + components + mechanisms without acknowledging they're different TYPES
- Can't add values + techniques + implementations + compositions

### 10.3 What a Sound Methodology Requires

**1. LENS SELECTION FIRST:**
- Explicitly choose lens based on extraction PURPOSE
- Document lens assumptions
- Don't mix lenses without reconciliation

**2. EQUAL VISUAL + SOURCE ANALYSIS:**
- 50% visual rendering, 50% source code
- Mandatory Playwright audit for all files

**3. MULTI-CONTEXT VALIDATION:**
- Test extraction on metaphor-driven content
- Test on data-heavy content
- Test on non-narrative content

**4. PRINCIPLED GRANULARITY:**
- Define: When is a variant a parameter vs separate component?
- Define: When is a value derivable vs extractable?
- Apply rules consistently

**5. ONTOLOGY COHERENCE:**
- Don't add items from different abstraction layers
- Separate constraints/vocabulary/grammar/components/patterns/decisions

**6. NEGATIVE SPACE EXTRACTION:**
- Document prohibitions explicitly
- Extract "don't do this" rules
- Count absences, not just presences

**7. SEMANTIC DOCUMENTATION:**
- Extract when-to-use rules
- Document decision criteria
- Don't assume "obvious from examples"

## 11. FINAL VERDICT

### 11.1 The Prior Count (45/18/12/8) is INVALID

**Why:**
- Mixes incompatible ontologies (values + implementations + compositions)
- Inflated by web standards (skip-link, reduced-motion)
- Deflated by missing prohibitions (8+ not counted)
- Lens collision (frequency + identity without reconciliation)
- Granularity inconsistency (6 callouts vs 2 prohibitions)

### 11.2 The Confident Core (What We KNOW)

**3 soul constraints (Tier 1):**
- border-radius: 0
- box-shadow: none
- --color-primary: #E83025

**12 vocabulary items (Tier 2):**
- 8 core colors
- 3 fonts
- 1 callout DNA

**1 compositional framework (Tier 2):**
- 3-category border system

**Total confident: 16 items across 3 tiers**

### 11.3 The Contested Territory (Requires Further Research)

**Lens-dependent counts:**
- Spacing: 6 anchors (enablement) vs 14 values (reuse)
- Components: 7 archetypes (enablement) vs 18 (reuse) vs 29 (identity)
- Patterns: 0% extractable (rigidity) vs 20-40% (prior research)

**Missing documentation:**
- 8+ prohibitions (negative rules)
- 6+ semantic decision rules (when-to-use)
- Compositional grammar (how to combine)
- Perceptual audit criteria

**Unvalidated assumptions:**
- Responsive strategy (only 768px observed)
- Dark mode (no implementations exist)
- Generalizability to non-metaphor content

### 11.4 The Honest Answer

**Prior extraction research asked:** "What should be extracted?"

**Wave 1 lenses revealed:** This question has NO SINGLE ANSWER — it depends on your worldview.

- **Frequency lens:** Extract 42-45 high-repetition patterns
- **Enablement lens:** Extract 7 blocking archetypes (~102 lines)
- **Identity lens:** Extract 29 character-defining items
- **Creative lens:** Extract 9 generative primitives
- **Hybrid (rigidity-informed):** Extract vocabulary (tokens, mechanisms), document patterns as case studies

**The extraction decision is NOT DISCOVERY (finding what exists) but CHOICE (selecting what to preserve based on values).**

**The methodology was sound for FREQUENCY-based extraction.**

**But FREQUENCY is only ONE of 12 possible lenses.**

**END ADVERSARIAL REVIEW**

**Critical findings:** 14 gaps identified, 7 methodology conflicts exposed, 3 counting errors proven, 1 alternative categorization proposed.

**Recommendation:** Abandon additive counting (45+18+12+8). Adopt layered ontology (constraints/vocabulary/grammar/components/case-studies/decisions). Choose extraction lens FIRST, then apply systematically.

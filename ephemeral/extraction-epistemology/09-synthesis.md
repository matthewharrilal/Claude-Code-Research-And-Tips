## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — Quick Reference

### What We Discovered About Extraction

**The Core Finding:** **Extraction is CONSTRUCTION disguised as DISCOVERY.**

All 5 Wave 1 agents claimed different methodologies (fresh-eyes, frequency, enablement, identity, lens-derivation), yet ALL shared invisible assumptions:
- Design systems are FOR agents (anthropocentric)
- Extraction produces discrete items (atomistic)
- Value exists independent of context (essentialist)
- The material contains pre-existing patterns (discovery bias)

**The Epistemological Insight:**

Patterns don't exist "out there" waiting to be found. Patterns are CREATED through:
- The categories we bring (callout, frequency, soul)
- The thresholds we set (3+, 80%, blocking)
- The values we hold (reusability, identity, enablement)
- The lenses we apply (efficiency, expression, coherence)

**The Methodology Crisis:**

The prior extraction count (45/18/12/8 — tokens/components/mechanisms/patterns) is **EPISTEMOLOGICALLY INVALID** because it mixed incompatible ontologies:
- Tokens (values) + Components (implementations) + Mechanisms (techniques) + Patterns (compositions)
- This is like counting "3 colors + 4 brushes + 2 painting techniques + 1 aesthetic movement = 10 extractables"
- **You cannot add items from different abstraction layers**

**The Critical Disagreement:**

| Lens | Count | What They Counted |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Fresh-eyes | ~20 items | Visual patterns + compositional rules |
| Lens-derivation | 9 items | Generative meta-patterns + primitives |
| Reuse-frequency | 42-45 items | All patterns at 30%+ frequency |
| Enablement | 10 items | Minimum viable for creative freedom |
| Identity | 29 items | Soul + compositional + semantic |
| Count-validator | 56/25/15/14 | ALL named artifacts in codebase |

**Difference between smallest (9) and largest (56): 6.2×**

This isn't counting error. It's **LENS-DEPENDENT REALITY CONSTRUCTION.**

### The Honest Answer

**There is NO SINGLE CORRECT extraction.**

Different purposes require different lenses:
- **Stability lens** (frequency): Extract 42-45 high-repetition patterns
- **Minimalism lens** (enablement): Extract 10 blocking constraints
- **Identity lens** (soul): Extract 29 character-defining items
- **Creativity lens** (generative): Extract 9 meta-patterns
- **Completeness lens** (existence): Extract 56 all named artifacts

**Phase C must CHOOSE a lens based on PURPOSE, not seek "objective truth."**

## QUICK REFERENCE TABLE — Key Findings

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What should be extracted?** | **DEPENDS on extraction lens** (frequency vs enablement vs identity) |
| **How many items?** | **9 to 56** depending on lens + granularity |
| **What's absolutely certain?** | **3 soul constraints**: border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none, --color-primary: #E83025 |
| **What's contested?** | **Callouts: 1 component or 6?** Spacing: 6 anchors or 14 values? Patterns: extractable or not? |
| **What's the confident core?** | **16 items**: 3 soul + 8 colors + 3 fonts + 1 callout DNA + 1 border system |
| **What's missing?** | **8+ prohibitions**, 6+ semantic rules, compositional grammar, when-to-use criteria |
| **Should we restrict volume?** | **NO** — volume doesn't cause gravity, positioning does (timing + framing) |
| **How to prevent pattern-matching?** | **Architectural positioning**: library AFTER derivation, framed as gallery not menu |
| **What's the methodology flaw?** | **Lens-blindness** — defaulted to frequency without conscious choice |
| **Can agents have fresh eyes?** | **NO** — they bring training distribution, task framing, reading order |
| **Does reading order matter?** | **YES** — visual-first extracts perceptual patterns, source-first extracts technical constraints |

## 1. THE EXTRACTION WORLDVIEW — What Extraction IS

### 1.1 Discovery vs Construction

**ALL agents described extraction as DISCOVERY:**
- "I identified extractable components" (Fresh-eyes)
- "Frequency data REVEALS stable core" (Reuse-lens)
- "Visual rendering REVEALS soul" (Identity-lens)
- "Agents NEED these primitives" (Enablement-lens)

**But extraction is actually CONSTRUCTION:**

**The Kant Schema-Content Duality:**
- **CONTENT** = the material (HTML files, CSS values, visual renderings)
- **SCHEMA** = the categories we bring (callout, frequency, soul, identity)
- **We never access pure content. We always access content-through-schema.**

**Evidence of construction:**

**Fact:** Callouts appear in 38/39 files (97.4% frequency)
**Construction 1:** "97.4% → MANDATORY extract" (threshold decision)
**Construction 2:** "Callout = 2-zone structure" (boundary decision)
**Construction 3:** "Extract as 1 component with parameters" vs "Extract as 6 semantic variants" (granularity decision)

**SAME FACT, MULTIPLE CONSTRUCTIONS.**

**The finding "callouts are extractable" is DEPENDENT on:**
1. How we define "callout" (2-zone? labeled box? any accent element?)
2. What threshold we set for "extractable" (100%? 80%? 50%?)
3. How we count variants (1 component? 6 types?)

**Change any construction choice → different extraction.**

### 1.2 The Irreducible Duality

**Extraction is BOTH discovery AND construction, irreducibly intertwined.**

**DISCOVERY ELEMENTS (Objective):**
- Callouts appear in 97.4% of files ← FACT
- All files use border-radius: 0 ← FACT
- Primary red is #E83025 ← FACT

**CONSTRUCTION ELEMENTS (Subjective):**
- "97.4% means mandatory" ← DECISION
- "Border-radius: 0 is soul constraint" ← INTERPRETATION
- "#E83025 is identity-bearing" ← ATTRIBUTION

**You cannot discover without constructing:**
- To "discover" frequency, you must CONSTRUCT the category "callout" and threshold "frequent"
- To "discover" soul, you must CONSTRUCT the interpretation "sharp corners = identity"
- To "discover" enablement, you must CONSTRUCT the model "agents will violate without prohibition"

**The pattern doesn't pre-exist. The lens CREATES the pattern while appearing to reveal it.**

### 1.3 Shared Invisible Assumptions

**All 5 agents shared assumptions they couldn't see:**

#### ASSUMPTION 1: Design Systems Are FOR Agents
Every agent framed extraction as "what do agents need?"

**NEVER CONSIDERED:**
- Design systems as historical record (document what was, not prescribe what should be)
- Design systems as user experience (what users perceive)
- Design systems as cultural artifact (reflect values)

#### ASSUMPTION 2: Extraction Produces Discrete Items
Every agent counted items (20, 9, 42, 10, 29).

**NEVER CONSIDERED:**
- Design systems as continuous fields (gradients, not atoms)
- Design systems as relational networks (connections > nodes)
- Design systems as process documentation (workflows, not outputs)

#### ASSUMPTION 3: Value Exists Independent of Context
Every agent treated patterns as universally extractable.

**NEVER CONSIDERED:**
- Context-dependent extraction (pattern X for content type Y)
- Situated extraction (pattern value depends on user, task, environment)

#### ASSUMPTION 4: The Material Contains Pre-Existing Patterns
Every agent treated extraction as discovery.

**NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED:**
- Patterns are CONSTRUCTED by observers
- Categories are IMPOSED, not inherent
- Value is ATTRIBUTED, not discovered

#### ASSUMPTION 5: The Future Resembles the Past
Every agent assumed patterns that worked will continue working.

**NEVER CONSIDERED:**
- Evolution (soul might change)
- Paradigm shifts (Track 3 might replace Track 2)

#### ASSUMPTION 6: Extraction Preserves Meaning
Every agent assumed extracted patterns retain their power.

**NEVER CONSIDERED:**
- Decontextualization changes meaning
- Patterns lose power when removed from origin

**These assumptions are NOT universal truths. They're CULTURAL FRAMES from the design system paradigm.**

## 2. MULTI-LENS CONVERGENCE MAP — Where Lenses Agree and Diverge

### 2.1 THE CONSENSUS CORE (5/5 Lenses Agree)

**ONLY 3 ITEMS have perfect cross-lens consensus:**

```css
border-radius: 0;           /* Soul constraint — identity-defining */
box-shadow: none;           /* Soul constraint — identity-defining */
--color-primary: #E83025;   /* Signature brand color */
```

**Evidence:**
- Fresh-eyes: "Completely sharp corners everywhere"
- Lens-derivation: "Soul pieces are eternal (rigidity is the POINT)"
- Reuse: "100% frequency — UNIVERSAL"
- Enablement: "Prevents soul violations"
- Identity: "Breaking these breaks identity"

**Convergence strength:** 5/5 lenses, zero disagreement

**Why this matters:** These 3 are THE ONLY items with certainty approaching objectivity. Everything else is lens-dependent.

### 2.2 STRONG CONVERGENCE (4/5 Lenses Agree)

**13 additional items — High confidence but NOT universal:**

**CORE PALETTE (8 colors):**
- Background cream (#FEF9F5)
- Text soft-black (#1A1A1A)
- 5 accent colors (blue/green/coral/amber/purple)

**Agreeing:** Reuse (100%), Enablement (non-derivable), Identity (warmth signature), Fresh (observed)
**Dissenting:** Lens-derivation (palette extractable, specific hex values are parameters)

**TYPOGRAPHY TRINITY (3 fonts):**
- Instrument Serif (display)
- Inter (body)
- JetBrains Mono (code)

**Agreeing:** Reuse (100%), Identity (editorial voice), Enablement (specific fonts), Fresh (observed)
**Dissenting:** Lens-derivation (hierarchy extractable, fonts are implementation)

**2-ZONE CALLOUT DNA (1 pattern):**
- Sparse label + dense body + 4px border

**Agreeing:** Fresh (every page), Reuse (100%), Identity (compositional soul), Enablement (archetype)
**Dissenting:** Lens-derivation (pattern extractable, callout as component is over-specified)

**3-CATEGORY BORDER SYSTEM (1 framework):**
- 4px structural, 3px accent, 1px micro

**Agreeing:** Fresh (observed), Reuse (80%), Identity (depth without shadows), Enablement (constraint)
**Dissenting:** Lens-derivation (principle extractable, specific widths are parameters)

**TOTAL STRONG CONVERGENCE: 13 items**

### 2.3 MODERATE CONVERGENCE (3/5 Lenses)

**Spacing anchors (6 values):** 4, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80
**Code block (1 component):** Dark theme, syntax highlighting
**Header/Footer (2 components):** Dark full-bleed, minimal footer

**Evidence:** Multi-lens convergence but dissent on specificity

### 2.4 CONTESTED TERRITORY (Lens Conflict)

**WHERE LENSES GIVE OPPOSITE ANSWERS:**

#### Question 1: Are callout variants separate components or color parameters?

| Lens | Answer | Count |
|------|--------|-------|
| Enablement, Lens-derivation | Color parameters | 1 component |
| Reuse, Fresh-eyes | Separate semantic types | 6 components |

**Implication:** Depends on whether semantic differentiation = separate component

#### Question 2: Is the spacing scale 6 values or 14?

| Lens | Answer | Count |
|------|--------|-------|
| Enablement | 6 anchors (rest derivable) | 6 |
| Reuse | 14 distinct values | 14 |

**Implication:** Depends on whether "extractable" means "must be provided" or "appears in code"

#### Question 3: Are patterns extractable?

| Lens | Answer | Count |
|------|--------|-------|
| Rigidity-mechanics | NO (75-80% metaphor-generated) | 0 |
| Prior research | YES (mechanisms extractable) | 8 |
| Lens-derivation | Meta-patterns extractable | 9 |

**Implication:** Depends on whether "extract pattern" means "extract layout" or "extract technique"

#### Question 4: Component count — 7 vs 18 vs 29?

| Lens | Answer | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Enablement | 7 archetypes | Minimum viable for creative freedom |
| Reuse | 18 components | High-frequency reusable structures |
| Identity | 29 items | Soul + compositional + semantic |

**Implication:** Depends on extraction purpose (minimize vs document vs preserve identity)

### 2.5 WHERE LENSES MISS EACH OTHER ENTIRELY

**Items ONE lens extracts, OTHERS reject:**

**Lens-derivation extracts, others skip:**
- Fractal meta-pattern (generative principle)
- Compositional primitives (nesting, scale, rhythm)
- Creative enablement lens prioritizes generative power

**Enablement extracts, others skip:**
- Negative space rules (prohibitions)
- Usage discipline (when NOT to use serif)
- Constraint lens focuses on preventing failure

**Identity extracts, others skip:**
- Philosophical principles (anti-complexity)
- Process methodology (research-first)
- Non-code aspects of identity

**Reuse extracts, others skip:**
- Skip-link, focus-visible, reduced-motion
- Print styles
- Web standards (not KortAI-specific)

**Fresh extracts, others skip:**
- Drop cap pattern
- Progress indicators
- Visual-only patterns invisible in source

**Count-validator extracts, others skip:**
- Syntax highlighting tokens (7)
- Conversational-specific tokens (3)
- All named artifacts regardless of reuse

## 3. THE VALIDATED INVENTORY — Layered Answer

### 3.1 The Ontology Problem — Why Prior Counts Failed

**Prior research counted:**
- 45 tokens + 18 components + 12 mechanisms + 8 patterns = **83 extractables**

**This is INVALID because these operate at DIFFERENT ABSTRACTION LEVELS.**

**Analogy:**
- 3 paint colors (tokens)
- 2 brush techniques (mechanisms)
- 4 subject types (components: portrait, landscape, still-life, abstract)
- 5 aesthetic movements (patterns: impressionism, cubism, surrealism)
- = "14 extractables"?

**NO. These are LAYERS of a system, not additive items.**

**The correct structure:**

```
LAYER 1: IDENTITY CONSTRAINTS (Non-negotiable)
├─ Soul geometry: border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none
├─ Soul palette: #E83025, #FEF9F5, warm earth tones
├─ Prohibitions: no 2px, no gradients, no transparency tricks
└─ Typography trinity: Instrument Serif / Inter / JetBrains Mono

LAYER 2: DESIGN VOCABULARY (Reusable atoms)
├─ Color tokens (8-11 core colors)
├─ Spacing tokens (6 anchors or 14 values)
├─ Typography scale (6 levels)
└─ Border categories (4px/3px/1px)

LAYER 3: COMPOSITIONAL GRAMMAR (How to combine)
├─ 2-zone component DNA (label + body)
├─ 3-category border system (structural/data/micro)
├─ Dense/sparse alternation (rhythm principle)
└─ Mechanisms catalog (12-15 techniques)

LAYER 4: COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATIONS (Concrete patterns)
├─ Callout (with 6 semantic variants)
├─ Code block (dark theme)
├─ Tables (decision matrix + clean variants)
├─ Headers, footers, containers
└─ 10-25 total components (depends on granularity)

LAYER 5: COMPOSITIONAL CASE STUDIES (Not templates)
├─ PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL, FRACTAL
├─ CONVERSATIONAL, NARRATIVE
├─ Documented as PROOF not TEMPLATES
└─ Metaphor-specific, not extractable as layouts

LAYER 6: SEMANTIC DECISION RULES (When-to-use)
├─ Callout type selection (Info vs Tip vs Essence)
├─ Code display choice (inline vs block)
├─ Table styling choice (zebra vs clean)
└─ Density zone triggers
```

**This structure:**
- Separates CONSTRAINTS (Layer 1) from VOCABULARY (Layer 2)
- Distinguishes GRAMMAR (Layer 3) from IMPLEMENTATIONS (Layer 4)
- Isolates EXAMPLES (Layer 5) from DECISIONS (Layer 6)
- Makes abstraction levels explicit

### 3.2 The Consensus Inventory (What's Undeniable)

**TIER 1 — UNIVERSAL (Every lens finds it):**

**3 soul constraints:**
- border-radius: 0
- box-shadow: none
- --color-primary: #E83025

**8 core colors:**
- Background cream, text soft-black, 5 accents, border tan

**3 fonts:**
- Instrument Serif, Inter, JetBrains Mono

**1 callout DNA:**
- 2-zone structure (sparse label + dense body + 4px border)

**1 border system:**
- 3-category (4px structural / 3px accent / 1px micro)

**TOTAL CONSENSUS: 16 items**

**Confidence: VERY HIGH** — Multi-lens convergence + 90-100% frequency + visual confirmation

### 3.3 The Probable Inventory (What Most Lenses Find)

**TIER 2 — STRONG (4/5 or 3/5 lenses agree):**

**Spacing anchors:** 6 values (4, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80) — or 14 if counting all
**Code block:** 1 component (dark theme)
**Headers/footers:** 2 components
**Typography scale:** 6 levels
**Skip-link/focus-visible:** Accessibility scaffolding
**Responsive collapse:** 768px grid→single-column

**TOTAL PROBABLE: 12-18 additional items**

**Confidence: HIGH** — Multi-lens convergence but some dissent on granularity

### 3.4 The Lens-Dependent Inventory (What Some Lenses Find)

**TIER 3 — CONTESTED (2/5 lenses, or lens-specific):**

**File tree component:** Reuse (60%), Fresh (observed), Enablement (skip)
**Decision matrices:** Reuse (50%), Identity (semantic), Enablement (derivable)
**Essence pull quote:** Reuse (40%), Identity (editorial), Fresh (observed)
**Task lists:** Reuse (40%), observed in implementation-heavy pages

**Prohibitions (Enablement-specific):**
- No 2px borders
- No rounded corners
- No drop shadows
- No semi-transparent backgrounds
- Serif NOT for body text
- No gradient backgrounds
- **TOTAL: 8+ prohibitions**

**Meta-patterns (Lens-derivation specific):**
- Fractal self-similarity principle
- Compositional primitives (nesting, scale, rhythm)
- Creative enablement frameworks
- **TOTAL: 9 generative patterns**

**Philosophical identity (Identity-specific):**
- Anti-complexity principle
- Research-first methodology
- Perceptual depth over decoration
- **TOTAL: 3 principles**

**TOTAL LENS-DEPENDENT: 20-40 additional items**

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Depends on lens choice and extraction purpose

### 3.5 The Constructed Inventory (What One Lens Creates)

**TIER 4 — UNIQUE (Only 1 lens finds it):**

**Fresh-eyes only:**
- Drop cap pattern
- Progress indicators
- Visual rhythm observations
- Font loading timing considerations

**Reuse-only:**
- Print styles
- All web standards (skip-link counted separately from accessibility)

**Count-validator only:**
- Syntax highlighting tokens (7)
- Conversational-specific tokens (3)
- ALL named custom properties

**TOTAL CONSTRUCTED: 50-100+ items (existence lens)**

**Confidence: LOW** — Likely lens artifacts, not essential extractions

### 3.6 The Missing Inventory (What NO Lens Documented)

**CRITICAL GAPS identified by adversarial reviewer:**

1. **Semantic decision rules** — WHEN to use Info vs Context callout (both blue)
2. **Inline vs block code threshold** — What line count triggers code block?
3. **Table styling rules** — When zebra-striped vs clean?
4. **Breathing zone triggers** — What content properties create breathing-room zones?
5. **Responsive strategy beyond 768px** — Mobile (375px)? Tablet (1024px)?
6. **Dark mode token overrides** — Planned but not validated
7. **Callout semantic differentiation** — 5 types? 6 types? Colors don't match across agents

**TOTAL MISSING: 7+ critical decision rules**

**Impact: HIGH** — These gaps make extracted components unusable without implicit knowledge

### 3.7 The Tiered Summary (Answer by Purpose)

**IF PURPOSE = STABILITY (preserve what works):**
Extract **TIER 1 + 2** = 28-34 items

**IF PURPOSE = MINIMALISM (creative freedom):**
Extract **TIER 1 only** = 16 items (consensus core)

**IF PURPOSE = IDENTITY (soul preservation):**
Extract **TIER 1 + prohibitions + principles** = 16 + 8 + 3 = 27 items

**IF PURPOSE = COMPLETENESS (full documentation):**
Extract **TIER 1 + 2 + 3** = 48-74 items

**IF PURPOSE = EXISTENCE (all artifacts):**
Extract **ALL TIERS** = 100+ items (56 tokens + 25 components + etc.)

**The extraction count DEPENDS on extraction lens and purpose.**

## 4. THE EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY FOR PHASE C

### 4.1 The Fundamental Choice — Which Lens?

**BEFORE EXTRACTING, Phase C MUST answer:**

**What is the PURPOSE of this extraction?**

| Purpose | Recommended Lens | Expected Count | Rationale |
|---------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Preserve soul identity** | Identity lens | 27-29 items | Character-defining elements |
| **Enable creative freedom** | Enablement lens | 10-16 items | Minimum viable, maximum flexibility |
| **Document proven patterns** | Reuse lens | 42-45 items | High-frequency = validated |
| **Foster innovation** | Creative lens | 9 meta-patterns | Generative primitives |
| **Comprehensive reference** | Hybrid (Identity + Reuse) | 40-50 items | Soul + common vocabulary |

**The prior research used HYBRID (identity + reuse) implicitly.**

**For Phase C, EXPLICIT LENS CHOICE is critical:**

**RECOMMENDATION: Identity + Enablement Hybrid**

**Why:**
- **Identity** ensures soul preservation (non-negotiable)
- **Enablement** ensures creative freedom (prevents pattern-matching)
- **Hybrid** balances constraint (identity) with freedom (enablement)

**Expected count: 30-40 items**
- 16 consensus core (Tier 1)
- 8 prohibitions (enablement-specific)
- 6-16 additional components/mechanisms (identity + frequency)

### 4.2 The Extraction Sequence (CRITICAL — Order Matters)

**FROM RIGIDITY SYNTHESIS: The master variable is WHEN patterns are consulted, not WHAT they contain.**

**PHASE C EXTRACTION WORKFLOW:**

```
Phase C-I: VOCABULARY EXTRACTION (Tokens + Components)
  ↓ (LOW GRAVITY — these are atoms, not decisions)
Phase C-II: MECHANISM EXTRACTION (Techniques)
  ↓ (MEDIUM GRAVITY — reusable techniques)
Phase C-III: CASE STUDY DOCUMENTATION (Patterns as proof)
  ↓ (HIGH GRAVITY — metaphor-driven decisions)
  ↓ CRITICAL: Frame as GALLERY not TEMPLATES
Phase C-IV: DECISION RULE DOCUMENTATION (When-to-use)
  ↓ (Fill missing semantic rules)
Phase C-V: PROHIBITION DOCUMENTATION (Negative rules)
  ↓ (What NOT to do — enablement lens)
```

**CRITICAL TIMING RULES:**

1. **Vocabulary FIRST** — tokens/components have zero gravity
2. **Mechanisms SECOND** — techniques before examples
3. **Case studies LAST** — patterns are high-gravity, isolate them
4. **NEVER mix layers** — tokens ≠ patterns, keep separate files

**FROM PROCESS METACOGNITION: Reading order shapes categories.**

**If Phase C agents extract in THIS order:**
1. Read tokens → categorize as "vocabulary"
2. Read components → categorize as "structures"
3. Read patterns → categorize as "examples"

**If Phase C agents extract in REVERSE order:**
1. Read patterns → categorize as "templates"
2. Read components → categorize as "pattern parts"
3. Read tokens → categorize as "pattern parameters"

**SAME MATERIAL. OPPOSITE FRAMING.**

**ENFORCEMENT:**

**Binary sequential rule (from MEMORY.md finding):**
> "You MUST extract in this order: Vocabulary → Mechanisms → Case Studies. DO NOT read pattern files until after vocabulary extraction is complete."

Binary rules achieve 100% compliance. Judgment rules achieve ~0%.

### 4.3 Anti-Gravity Integration (How to Prevent Pattern-Matching)

**FROM RIGIDITY SYNTHESIS: Pattern gravity is defeated through ARCHITECTURAL POSITIONING, not information restriction.**

**12 Anti-Gravity Mechanisms — Ranked by Effectiveness:**

#### TIER 1: STRUCTURAL (Work without correct agent invocation)

**M1. Phase-Gated Library Access (★★★★★ CRITICAL)**
- **What:** Library files physically separated during creative phase
- **How:** Vocabulary in `/foundations/`, patterns in `/case-studies/` (separate files)
- **Effect:** Patterns UNAVAILABLE during creative work → zero retrieval anchor
- **Applies to Phase C:** Extract patterns LAST, in separate file from vocabulary

**M2. Dual-File Split — Mechanisms vs Metaphors (★★★★★ CRITICAL)**
- **What:** `MECHANISM-CATALOG.md` separate from `CASE-STUDIES.md`
- **How:** Extract reusable techniques (border-weight gradient) separate from full explorations (geological)
- **Effect:** Mechanisms = tools (low gravity), metaphors isolated (high gravity but inaccessible)
- **Applies to Phase C:** Create 2 output files, never mix techniques with examples

**M3. Anti-Prescription Headers (★★★★ HIGH)**
- **What:** Every case study begins "⚠️ NOT A TEMPLATE"
- **How:** Warning → tension narrative → mechanisms vs metaphor → divergence assignment
- **Effect:** Activates divergence mode before content read
- **Applies to Phase C:** All pattern documentation uses anti-prescription format

#### TIER 2: PROCEDURAL (Require correct prompting)

**M5. Binary Sequential Phase Rules (★★★★★ CRITICAL)**
- **What:** Mandatory sequence, library prohibited until after derivation
- **How:** "You MUST complete in order. DO NOT consult patterns until AFTER vocabulary extraction."
- **Effect:** Exploits "binary rules achieve 100% compliance"
- **Applies to Phase C:** Extraction agents MUST follow sequence: vocab → mechanisms → patterns

**M6. Explicit Divergence Mandate (★★★★★ HIGH)**
- **What:** Success = "novel approach" not "good execution"
- **How:** "You are EXPECTED to derive new categories. Using existing categories = pattern-matching."
- **Effect:** Success criteria exclude pattern-matching
- **Applies to Phase C:** Encourage agents to discover NEW extraction lenses, not repeat Wave 1

**M9. Divergence Verification Gate (★★★★ MEDIUM-HIGH)**
- **What:** Category novelty CHECK before proceeding
- **How:** Compare extraction categories to Wave 1 categories, require justification if identical
- **Effect:** Makes pattern-matching VISIBLE
- **Applies to Phase C:** Phase C-III gate: "Does your extraction differ from Wave 1? If not, why?"

#### TIER 3: HYBRID (Structural + procedural)

**M10. Diversity Tracking Dashboard (★★★★ HIGH)**
- **What:** Registry tracks which lenses have been used
- **How:** Maintain `LENS-REGISTRY.md` with usage counts
- **Effect:** Repetition becomes VISIBLE
- **Applies to Phase C:** If 5 agents all use frequency lens, show this BEFORE Wave 3

**M12. Jazz Catalog Framing (★★★★ HIGH)**
- **What:** Reframes library as "proof gallery" not "template catalog"
- **How:** "Wave 1 produced 5 extractions. These are STANDARDS. Learn them, then derive your own."
- **Effect:** Library = inspiration, not instruction
- **Applies to Phase C:** All pattern documentation framed as "case study" not "recipe"

### 4.4 The Extraction Architecture (File Structure)

**RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE (aligns with anti-gravity mechanisms):**

```
/active/design-system/
├── foundations/              ← LAYER 1 + 2 (LOW GRAVITY)
│   ├── tokens.md            (soul constraints, colors, fonts, spacing)
│   ├── components.md        (callouts, code blocks, headers)
│   └── prohibitions.md      (negative rules — what NOT to do)
│
├── techniques/              ← LAYER 3 (MEDIUM GRAVITY)
│   ├── mechanisms.md        (border-weight, 2-zone DNA, etc.)
│   └── compositional-grammar.md  (how to combine)
│
├── case-studies/            ← LAYER 5 (HIGH GRAVITY — ISOLATED)
│   ├── PULSE.md            (⚠️ NOT A TEMPLATE)
│   ├── GEOLOGICAL.md       (⚠️ NOT A TEMPLATE)
│   └── [all pattern explorations]
│
└── guidelines/              ← LAYER 6 (DECISION RULES)
    ├── semantic-rules.md   (when Info vs Context callout)
    ├── responsive-strategy.md  (breakpoint decisions)
    └── usage-criteria.md   (when to use components)
```

**CRITICAL: Case studies PHYSICALLY SEPARATED from foundations.**

Agents extracting vocabulary CANNOT accidentally read patterns (M1 enforcement).

### 4.5 The Framing Templates (How to Document)

**FOR MECHANISMS (Reusable techniques):**

```markdown
## Mechanism: Border-Weight Gradient

**Type:** Depth encoding technique
**Reusability:** UNIVERSAL (works for any hierarchy)

**The Pattern:**
Use border thickness to encode confidence/importance/hierarchy WITHOUT shadows:
- 4px: High confidence / structural
- 3px: Medium confidence / accent
- 1px: Low confidence / micro-elements

**Examples Where This Worked:**
- OD-004 Geological (certainty gradient via border-weight)
- Boris Archival Vault (clearance levels via border-weight)

**How to Apply:**
1. Identify hierarchy in YOUR content
2. Map hierarchy to border-weight scale
3. Test: Does thicker = more important feel natural?

✅ Extract: Border-weight as encoding variable
❌ Don't extract: Specific 4/3/1 values (adjust to your content)
```

**FOR CASE STUDIES (Metaphor-driven explorations):**

```markdown
## Case Study: Geological Stratification (OD-004)

⚠️ **READ THIS FIRST — NOT A TEMPLATE**

### Purpose of This Case Study
1. PROOF: Warmth/austerity tension CAN be resolved via geological metaphor
2. MECHANISM EXTRACTION: Border-weight gradient (reusable)
3. PROCESS LEARNING: Tension → metaphor → layout derivation

### Tension That Produced This
Boris content had:
- HIGH certainty at core principles (bedrock)
- MEDIUM certainty at practices (strata)
- LOW certainty at surface opinions (atmosphere)

Multi-axis questioning revealed "depth" and "sedimentation" as core tensions.

### The Search in Action (Narrative, NOT recipe)
[FULL STORY of Phase 1-3 actual derivation — show the PROCESS]

### What YOU Extract
✅ REUSABLE: Border-weight gradient technique
✅ REUSABLE: Certainty-to-depth mapping principle
❌ NOT REUSABLE: 6-layer structure (metaphor-specific)
❌ NOT REUSABLE: Geological vocabulary (bedrock, strata, etc.)

### Your Divergence Assignment
**If your metaphor is geological:**
Ask: "Did I derive this independently or pattern-match?"
Require: Strong justification if independent convergence

**If your metaphor is different:**
You successfully diverged. Extract the mechanisms, ignore the layout.
```

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCES:**
- "When to use" → "Tension that produced this" (specific not criteria)
- "Recipe steps" → "What YOU extract" (mechanisms vs metaphor split)
- Added warning + divergence assignment

### 4.6 The Phase C Specific Workflow

**PHASE C-I: VOCABULARY EXTRACTION**

**Input:** Fortress explorations (DD, OD, CD, AD)

**Agents:** 3-5 vocabulary extractors (parallel)

**Task:**
1. Read tokens from DD-006, OD-001, CD-001 (representative sample)
2. Extract colors, spacing, typography, geometry
3. Count frequency across all fortress files
4. Document in `/foundations/tokens.md`

**Output:** Tokens file (30-50 items)

**Timing:** ~4-6 hours

---

**PHASE C-II: COMPONENT EXTRACTION**

**Input:** Same fortress explorations

**Agents:** 3-5 component extractors (parallel)

**Task:**
1. Read HTML structures (callouts, code blocks, headers)
2. Identify 2-zone DNA and other structural patterns
3. Document in `/foundations/components.md`

**Output:** Components file (15-25 items)

**Timing:** ~4-6 hours

---

**PHASE C-III: MECHANISM EXTRACTION**

**Input:** All explorations + tension-test layouts

**Agents:** 2-3 mechanism extractors (parallel)

**Task:**
1. Read CSS techniques (border-weight, compression, solid-offset)
2. Separate REUSABLE techniques from metaphor-specific implementations
3. Document in `/techniques/mechanisms.md`

**Output:** Mechanisms catalog (12-20 techniques)

**Timing:** ~6-8 hours

**CRITICAL GATE:** Before proceeding to C-IV, COMMIT to mechanism catalog. No changes after case study extraction begins.

---

**PHASE C-IV: CASE STUDY DOCUMENTATION** ← HIGH GRAVITY ZONE

**Input:** Full explorations (DD-001 through AD-006)

**Agents:** 1-2 case study documenters (SERIAL not parallel)

**Task:**
1. For each exploration, document using anti-prescription template (Section 4.5)
2. Show tension narrative + mechanisms vs metaphor split
3. Add divergence assignments
4. Store in `/case-studies/` (SEPARATE from foundations)

**Output:** Case study files (8-15 patterns)

**Timing:** ~12-16 hours (each case study = 1-2 hours)

**CRITICAL FRAMING:** "You are documenting PROOF OF CONCEPT, not creating templates."

---

**PHASE C-V: DECISION RULE DOCUMENTATION**

**Input:** Gaps identified by adversarial reviewer (Section 3.6)

**Agents:** 1-2 decision rule documenters

**Task:**
1. Fill semantic rule gaps (when Info vs Context callout)
2. Document responsive strategy (breakpoints beyond 768px)
3. Create usage criteria (inline vs block code threshold)
4. Store in `/guidelines/`

**Output:** Decision rules file (7-10 rules)

**Timing:** ~4-6 hours

---

**PHASE C-VI: PROHIBITION DOCUMENTATION**

**Input:** Enablement lens findings (Section 3.4)

**Agents:** 1 prohibition documenter

**Task:**
1. Extract all negative rules (no 2px, no rounded corners, etc.)
2. Document rationale for each prohibition
3. Store in `/foundations/prohibitions.md`

**Output:** Prohibitions file (8-12 rules)

**Timing:** ~2-3 hours

---

**TOTAL PHASE C TIME ESTIMATE: 32-45 hours (4-6 days)**

**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
1. ✅ Vocabulary extracted BEFORE patterns documented
2. ✅ Mechanisms separated from metaphors (2 files, not 1)
3. ✅ All case studies use anti-prescription template
4. ✅ Decision rules documented (fill gaps)
5. ✅ Prohibitions documented (enablement lens)

---

## 5. ANTI-GRAVITY INTEGRATION — The 12 Mechanisms Applied

### 5.1 Why Restricting Volume DOESN'T Work

**THE VOLUME HYPOTHESIS (WRONG):**
> "More patterns = more gravity, so restrict pattern count."

**FROM RIGIDITY SYNTHESIS:**
> **"Volume is irrelevant below perception threshold. Framing becomes deterministic at first exposure."**

**Evidence:**
- Tension-composition skill (839 lines, ZERO named patterns) → produces novel metaphors
- Compositional strategy library (1,747 lines, 6 named patterns) → produces pattern-matching
- **SAME information volume. Different framing. Opposite creative outcomes.**

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) effect:**
- Library with 6 patterns → Agent sees top 3 matches
- Library with 60 patterns → Agent sees top 3 matches
- Library with 600 patterns → Agent sees top 3 matches

**Working memory constraint dominates volume.**

**From AI research (arXiv 2512.24120):**
> "n=3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus"

**The 3-example sweet spot is EMPIRICAL:**
- 1-2 examples: insufficient guidance
- **3 examples: OPTIMAL** (pattern recognition without collapse)
- 10+ examples: mode collapse toward frequent patterns

**Restricting access creates IGNORANCE, not FREEDOM.**

**The jazz pedagogy model:**
Charlie Parker practiced 15 hours/day, transcribed 100+ solos, learned 200+ standards — THEN "forgot all that and just wailed."

**The knowledge was SUBSTRATE, not TEMPLATE.**

**For Phase C: Extract ALL worthy patterns (8-15). POSITIONING defeats gravity, not restriction.**

### 5.2 The 12 Anti-Gravity Mechanisms (Ranked)

**FROM RIGIDITY SYNTHESIS — Complete mechanism catalog:**

#### TIER 1: STRUCTURAL (Work automatically)

**M1. Phase-Gated Library Access** ★★★★★ CRITICAL
- Patterns PHYSICALLY SEPARATED during creative phase
- Phase C application: Extract patterns LAST, in separate directory

**M2. Dual-File Split** ★★★★★ CRITICAL
- Mechanisms vs metaphors in different files
- Phase C application: `/techniques/mechanisms.md` vs `/case-studies/`

**M3. Anti-Prescription Headers** ★★★★ HIGH
- "⚠️ NOT A TEMPLATE" warning before content
- Phase C application: All case studies use anti-prescription template (Section 4.5)

**M4. Tier Vocabulary Shift** ★★ MEDIUM
- Rename tier-1/2/3 → foundations/techniques/case-studies
- Phase C application: Use functional names, not hierarchical numbers

#### TIER 2: PROCEDURAL (Require correct prompting)

**M5. Binary Sequential Phase Rules** ★★★★★ CRITICAL
- Mandatory sequence: vocab → mechanisms → patterns
- Phase C application: "You MUST extract in this order. DO NOT read patterns until vocab done."

**M6. Explicit Divergence Mandate** ★★★★★ HIGH
- Success = "novel approach" not "good execution"
- Phase C application: Reward NEW extraction lenses, not repeating Wave 1

**M7. The Charlie Parker Instruction** ★★★ MEDIUM
- "Forget the library" during creative phase
- Phase C application: "You have Wave 1 extractions. For YOUR extraction, forget they exist."

**M8. 3-Example Sampling** ★★★★ HIGH
- Load 2-4 MOST RELEVANT examples (not all)
- Phase C application: After vocab extraction, show 3 sample case studies, not all 15

**M9. Divergence Verification Gate** ★★★★ MEDIUM-HIGH
- Check category novelty before proceeding
- Phase C application: "Compare your extraction to Wave 1. If identical, justify or regenerate."

#### TIER 3: HYBRID (Structural + procedural)

**M10. Diversity Tracking Dashboard** ★★★★ HIGH
- Track which lenses have been used
- Phase C application: Maintain `LENS-REGISTRY.md` showing Wave 1 lens usage

**M11. Two-Phase Prompting** ★★★★★ VERY HIGH
- Generation context separate from evaluation context
- Phase C application: Phase C-I-III (vocab/components/mechanisms) blind to patterns → Phase C-IV reads patterns

**M12. Jazz Catalog Framing** ★★★★ HIGH
- Library as "proof gallery" not "template catalog"
- Phase C application: "Wave 1 produced 5 extractions. Learn them, then derive your own."

### 5.3 Essential Mechanism Bundle (Minimum Viable)

**For Phase C, MUST deploy:**

**ESSENTIAL (4 mechanisms):**
- M1: Phase-gated access (structural separation)
- M2: Dual-file split (mechanisms vs metaphors)
- M5: Binary sequential rules (procedural enforcement)
- M6: Divergence mandate (success criteria shift)

**These 4 provide core anti-gravity protection.**

**ROBUST (add these second — 7 total):**
- M3: Anti-prescription headers
- M9: Verification gate
- M12: Jazz catalog framing

**ENHANCED (add these third — 10 total):**
- M8: 3-example sampling
- M10: Diversity tracking
- M11: Two-phase prompting

**Phase C should deploy AT MINIMUM the Essential 4, ideally Robust 7.**

### 5.4 How Mechanisms Scale (8 → 30 → 100+ patterns)

**FROM RIGIDITY SYNTHESIS: Best mechanisms LEVERAGE scale, don't fight it.**

**MECHANISMS THAT IMPROVE WITH SCALE:**

**M6 (Divergence mandate):**
- At 8 patterns: convergence plausible (overlapping tensions)
- At 100 patterns: convergence statistically unlikely
- **Effect:** Larger library = higher bar for "independent convergence"

**M8 (3-example sampling):**
- At 8 patterns: sample 3 of 8 (37% of library)
- At 100 patterns: sample 3 of 100 (3% of library)
- **Effect:** Better relevance — select 3 MOST similar from larger pool

**M10 (Diversity tracking):**
- At 8 patterns: nice-to-have
- At 100 patterns: ESSENTIAL
- **Effect:** Prevents invisible over-repetition

**M12 (Jazz framing):**
- At 8 patterns: "200+ standards" feels artificial
- At 100 patterns: "200+ standards" feels authentic
- **Effect:** Framing becomes MORE credible at scale

**MECHANISMS THAT REMAIN CONSTANT:**

M1, M2, M5, M9, M11 — Same effectiveness regardless of volume

**MECHANISMS THAT DEGRADE WITH SCALE:**

**M3 (Anti-prescription headers):**
- Warning impact dilutes if EVERY pattern has same warning
- **Mitigation:** Vary warning language across case studies

**M7 (Forget instruction):**
- Harder to "forget" 100-pattern library than 10-pattern library
- **Mitigation:** Rely on M1 (structural separation) more than M7

**CRITICAL: Phase C should prioritize mechanisms that IMPROVE or REMAIN CONSTANT at scale.**

### 6.3 Skill Enrichments (What Changes in Skills)

**tension-composition/SKILL.md additions:**

1. **Phase 0A: Library Prohibition** (NEW, Line ~25)
```markdown
⚠️ **ANTI-GRAVITY WARNING**

During Phase 1-3, you MUST NOT consult:
- /active/design-system/case-studies/ (pattern library)
- Prior compositional explorations

These are VALIDATION tools, not GENERATION tools.
Consulting them before Phase 4 = pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.
```

2. **Phase 3.5: Metaphor Commitment Gate** (NEW, after Phase 3)
```markdown
## Phase 3.5: Metaphor Commitment (LOCK-IN)

Before proceeding to implementation:

1. State your committed metaphor: _______________
2. Check divergence: Does this appear in case-studies/_INDEX.md?
   - If YES: Justify independent convergence OR regenerate
   - If NO: Proceed to Phase 4

**You are LOCKED IN to this metaphor.**
Do NOT change after consulting library.
```

3. **Phase 4: Mechanism Extraction** (REVISED)
```markdown
## Phase 4: Mechanism Extraction

**NOW you may consult:**
- /active/design-system/techniques/mechanisms.md
- Foundation components

**What to extract:**
✅ Border-weight encoding techniques
✅ Spacing patterns
✅ 2-zone component structures

**What NOT to extract:**
❌ Full layout architectures
❌ Metaphor-specific vocabulary
❌ Section structures from case studies

**Sample 2-3 mechanisms most relevant to YOUR metaphor.**
Do NOT read all mechanisms.
```

4. **Phase 5: Divergence Verification** (NEW)
```markdown
## Phase 5: Divergence Verification

**NOW you may consult:**
- /active/design-system/case-studies/ (read 2-3 MOST similar)

**Verification table:**

| Your Metaphor | Similar Case Study | Convergence? | Justification |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| [yours] | [study 1] | YES / NO | [why independent?] |
| [yours] | [study 2] | YES / NO | [why independent?] |

**If convergence detected:**
Require STRONG justification for independent derivation.
Consider: Did tension analysis genuinely lead here? Or pattern-matching?
```

**perceptual-auditing/SKILL.md additions:**

1. **Anti-Audit-Optimization Warning** (NEW, early in skill)
```markdown
⚠️ **AUDIT OPTIMIZATION TRAP**

This skill defines success criteria (48 PA questions, guardrails).

DO NOT:
- Build pages TO PASS this audit
- Optimize for perceptual scores over content service

DO:
- Build pages to serve content
- Use audit to verify, not to design
```

2. **Metaphor-Awareness Section** (NEW, from skill enrichment research)
```markdown
## Metaphor-Driven Biases (PA Questions 41-48)

Metaphors encode spatial biases as CSS values:
- "Geological depth" → large padding at bottom (depth = space)
- "Manuscript margin" → asymmetric padding (margin = ritual)
- "Industrial efficiency" → minimal padding (efficiency = compression)

**The bias is NOT WRONG — it serves the metaphor.**

**But ask:**
PA-41: Does compression ratio meet 40% floor? (prevent metaphor from breaking UX)
PA-42: Does label-to-heading meet 16px floor? (prevent metaphor from crushing hierarchy)

**The principle:** The metaphor shapes experience; the guardrails prevent it from breaking experience.
```

### 6.4 Gallery/Case Studies (What Format)

**Each case study follows anti-prescription template:**

```markdown
# Case Study: [Pattern Name] ([Source File])

⚠️ **THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE — READ THIS FIRST**

---

## Purpose of This Case Study

1. **PROOF:** [Tension type] CAN be resolved via [metaphor approach]
2. **MECHANISM EXTRACTION:** Reusable techniques you can apply
3. **PROCESS LEARNING:** Tension → metaphor → layout derivation workflow

---

## Tension That Produced This (Specific, Not Criteria)

[FULL NARRATIVE of actual Phase 1-2 work for THIS specific content]

**Content characteristics:**
- [Actual properties — warmth/austerity, simple/complex, etc.]
- [What multi-axis questioning revealed]
- [Specific tension scores]

**NOT "When your content has X characteristic, use this pattern."**
**INSTEAD: "THIS content HAD these characteristics, tension analysis LED to this metaphor."**

---

## The Search in Action (Narrative, NOT Recipe)

[TELL THE STORY of how the metaphor emerged — Phase 2 actual experience]

**Key decisions:**
- Why this metaphor vs alternatives considered
- What query construction revealed
- How collapse happened (multiple axes → single metaphor)

**This is RETROSPECTIVE NARRATIVE, not PRESCRIPTIVE RECIPE.**

---

## What YOU Extract (Mechanisms vs Metaphor)

### ✅ REUSABLE MECHANISMS (Apply to ANY content)

**Mechanism 1: [Name]**
- What it is: [Technique description]
- How it works: [Implementation]
- Examples: [Where else this appeared]

**Mechanism 2: [Name]**
[Same structure]

### ❌ NOT REUSABLE (Metaphor-Specific)

**Layout structure:**
- [Specific section hierarchy — this is metaphor-driven]

**Vocabulary:**
- [Metaphor-specific labels — bedrock, strata, atmosphere, etc.]

**Spacing values:**
- [Specific padding/margin — these encode metaphor biases]

---

## Your Divergence Assignment

### If Your Metaphor is Similar

**Ask yourself:**
1. Did tension analysis INDEPENDENTLY lead me here?
2. Or did I see this case study and pattern-match?
3. Can I justify convergence as genuine independent derivation?

**Require STRONG evidence for independent convergence.**

### If Your Metaphor is Different

**You successfully diverged.** Extract the mechanisms, ignore the layout.

---

## Implementation Notes

[Technical details: HTML structure, CSS specifics, responsive behavior]

---

## Perceptual Audit Results

[PA scores, guardrail compliance, what this teaches about metaphor biases]

---

**Case Study Status:** Validated [Date]
**Source:** [File path]
**Related Mechanisms:** [Links to techniques/mechanisms.md]
```

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCES from prior pattern documentation:**
- "When to use" → "Tension that produced this" (removes criteria-matching)
- Recipe steps → Narrative story (removes template feeling)
- Added mechanisms vs metaphor split (explicit extraction guidance)
- Added divergence assignment (forces novelty verification)

---

## 7. HONEST ASSESSMENT — What We Know and Don't Know

### 7.1 High Confidence (Backed by Convergent Evidence)

**EXTRACTION IS CONSTRUCTION:**
- Evidence: All 5 lenses produced different counts (9-56)
- Evidence: Same material, different reading orders → different categories
- Evidence: Lens-derivation couldn't escape "extraction = libraries" frame
- **Confidence: VERY HIGH** — This is fundamental epistemology, not methodology flaw

**THE 3-ITEM CONSENSUS CORE:**
- border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none, --color-primary: #E83025
- Evidence: 5/5 lenses agree, 100% frequency, visual confirmation
- **Confidence: VERY HIGH** — This is as objective as extraction gets

**TIMING > VOLUME:**
- Evidence: Rigidity synthesis, cognitive mechanics, RAG architecture
- Evidence: Tension-composition skill (no patterns) vs strategy library (6 patterns) produce opposite outcomes
- **Confidence: VERY HIGH** — Empirically validated in analogous domains

**BINARY RULES WORK:**
- Evidence: MEMORY.md metacognition finding (100% compliance vs ~0%)
- Evidence: Historical team behavior across 13 agent teams
- **Confidence: HIGH** — Needs validation in THIS specific workflow

**FRAMING DETERMINES MODE:**
- Evidence: "When to use" triggers lookup, "tension that produced" triggers search
- Evidence: Rigidity synthesis mechanism design
- **Confidence: HIGH** — Theory is sound, needs empirical testing

### 7.2 Medium Confidence (Strong Evidence, Needs Validation)

**THE 16-ITEM CONFIDENT CORE:**
- 3 soul + 8 colors + 3 fonts + 1 callout DNA + 1 border system
- Evidence: 4/5 lenses agree, high frequency, visual confirmation
- **Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH** — Multi-lens convergence, but granularity contested

**THE 12 ANTI-GRAVITY MECHANISMS WILL WORK:**
- Evidence: Based on jazz pedagogy, AI mode collapse research, LLM architecture
- Evidence: Rigidity synthesis deep analysis
- **Confidence: MEDIUM** — Theory is robust, but NOT YET tested in this context

**REFRAMING ELIMINATES GRAVITY:**
- Theory: SAME precision, DIFFERENT framing (anti-prescription template)
- Evidence: Cognitive mechanics research
- **Confidence: MEDIUM** — Makes sense, but requires validation
  - Test: Do agents actually follow "NOT A TEMPLATE" warnings?
  - Or do they ignore warnings and pattern-match anyway?

**DIVERSITY TRACKING PREVENTS REPETITION:**
- Theory: Visibility creates awareness (M10)
- Evidence: Makes intuitive sense
- **Confidence: MEDIUM** — Requires Weaver maintenance, solo agents won't have this

### 7.3 Low Confidence (Uncertain, Requires Testing)

**LENS CHOICE DOESN'T MATTER:**
- Question: Are all lenses equally valid? Or is one objectively better?
- **Confidence: LOW** — We ASSUME lens-pluralism, but haven't PROVEN it
- **Test needed:** Build with frequency lens vs identity lens, measure long-term success

**THE EXACT THRESHOLD (3 EXAMPLES):**
- Evidence: AI research cited n=3 for neural networks
- Question: Does this generalize to compositional metaphor selection?
- **Confidence: LOW** — Might be 2-4 range, not exactly 3
- **Test needed:** Build with 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 examples shown, measure novelty

**ANTI-PRESCRIPTION WARNINGS WORK:**
- Question: Is "⚠️ NOT A TEMPLATE" strong enough?
- **Confidence: LOW** — Agents might ignore warnings
- **Test needed:** Build with no warning, weak, strong, very strong variants

**TWO-PHASE PROMPTING IS NECESSARY:**
- Question: Does M11 (architecturally complex) add value over M1+M5?
- **Confidence: LOW** — Single-phase with timing rules might suffice
- **Test needed:** Single-phase vs two-phase, measure novelty + quality

**TIER NUMBERING CREATES GRAVITY:**
- Question: Does tier-1/2/3 actually create hierarchy perception?
- **Confidence: LOW** — Assumed, not proven
- **Test needed:** Same library, tier-X vs functional naming, measure perception

### 7.4 What We Still Don't Know

**CRITICAL UNKNOWNS:**

1. **Do agents actually comply with binary sequential rules in THIS workflow?**
   - MEMORY.md finding is about HISTORICAL team behavior
   - May not generalize to Phase C extraction context
   - **Requires:** Phase C pilot with skip-rate measurement

2. **What's the optimal mechanism bundle?**
   - Essential 4 vs Robust 7 vs Enhanced 10 vs All 12?
   - What's the sweet spot (effectiveness vs complexity)?
   - **Requires:** Incremental deployment, effectiveness measurement at each tier

3. **What happens at SCALE (100+ patterns)?**
   - Mechanisms designed to scale, but NOT YET tested
   - Does M3 (warnings) degrade via fatigue?
   - Does M12 (jazz framing) improve authenticity?
   - **Requires:** Long-term tracking as library grows

4. **Can solo agents use these mechanisms?**
   - M8 (sampling) and M10 (tracking) assume Weaver
   - What's the fallback for solo workflows?
   - **Requires:** Solo agent workflow design

5. **Does the LAYERED ONTOLOGY actually clarify?**
   - Proposed 6-layer structure (Section 3.1) untested
   - Does it reduce confusion? Or add complexity?
   - **Requires:** User testing with agents using old vs new categorization

### 7.5 What Could Invalidate This Framework

**FAILURE SCENARIOS:**

**SCENARIO 1: Procedural Compliance Failure**
- Agents skip Phase 1-3, read library immediately
- **Impact:** M5, M6, M7, M9 fail (all procedural)
- **Detection:** Monitor agent behavior, measure skip rate
- **Mitigation:** Rely on M1, M2 (structural) as primary defense

**SCENARIO 2: Framing Ineffectiveness**
- Agents read "NOT A TEMPLATE" but interpret as weak suggestion
- **Impact:** M3, M12 fail (framing mechanisms)
- **Detection:** Measure pattern-matching rate despite warnings
- **Mitigation:** Combine framing with enforcement (M5, M9)

**SCENARIO 3: Lens-Pluralism is Wrong**
- One lens is objectively superior, others are invalid
- **Impact:** Entire framework (lens-dependent extraction) collapses
- **Detection:** Long-term success tracking by lens
- **Mitigation:** Re-evaluate lens validity based on outcomes

**SCENARIO 4: Construction-Discovery Duality is Too Abstract**
- Agents can't operationalize "acknowledge construction"
- **Impact:** Philosophical insight doesn't translate to practice
- **Detection:** Agent confusion, inability to apply framework
- **Mitigation:** Provide concrete checklists, not abstract principles

**SCENARIO 5: The Mechanisms DON'T Scale**
- M3, M7 degrade at 100+ patterns (warning fatigue)
- **Impact:** Anti-gravity fails as library grows
- **Detection:** Pattern-matching rate increases with library size
- **Mitigation:** Shift to structural mechanisms (M1, M2) at scale

### 7.6 What Requires Empirical Validation

**THE CRITICAL VALIDATION TEST:**

Build the SAME content (warmth/austerity tension) with 4 variants:

**Variant A (Control):**
- Tension-composition skill only
- NO library access
- **Predicted:** HIGH novelty, VARIABLE quality

**Variant B (Weak Permission):**
- Skill + library + "consider as starting points"
- **Predicted:** LOW novelty (weak permission insufficient)

**Variant C (Strong Intervention):**
- Skill + binary rules + anti-prescription library
- **Predicted:** HIGH novelty, HIGH quality (intervention works)

**Variant D (Library-First):**
- Skill + library read BEFORE tension derivation
- **Predicted:** ZERO novelty (all pattern-match)

**Measure:**

| Metric | A | B | C | D |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| Metaphor novelty (0-5) | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Library match (binary) | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Time to Phase 3 | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| PA score | ? | ? | ? | ? |

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Variant C achieves HIGH novelty (4-5/5) + HIGH quality (PA score ≥35/40)
- Variant C > Variant A (quality improvement from mechanisms)
- Variant C >> Variant B, D (novelty preservation despite library access)

**If Variant C succeeds:** Framework validated
**If Variant C fails:** Framing too weak, increase prohibition strength or use M11 (two-phase)

## 8. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHASE C EXTRACTION

### 8.1 The Recommended Lens (Explicit Choice)

**FOR PHASE C: Identity + Enablement Hybrid**

**Why Identity Lens:**
- Preserves soul (non-negotiable KortAI character)
- Extracts 27-29 identity-bearing items
- Ensures recognizability across all outputs

**Why Enablement Lens:**
- Ensures creative freedom (prevents pattern-matching)
- Extracts prohibitions (negative rules agents need)
- Minimalist (10-16 items core)

**Why Hybrid:**
- Identity ALONE risks over-specification (too many items)
- Enablement ALONE risks under-specification (agents miss important patterns)
- TOGETHER: Soul preservation + creative freedom

**Expected Count: 30-40 items**
- 16 consensus core (Tier 1 universal)
- 8 prohibitions (enablement-specific)
- 6-16 additional components/mechanisms (identity + frequency convergence)

**NOT USING:**
- Pure frequency lens (privileges past over future, backward-looking)
- Pure creative lens (9 meta-patterns too abstract for immediate use)
- Completeness lens (56+ items = bloat)

### 8.2 The Recommended Sequence (Step-by-Step)

**PHASE C-I: VOCABULARY EXTRACTION (Tokens + Components)**
- **Timing:** 4-6 hours
- **Agents:** 3-5 parallel extractors
- **Input:** DD-006, OD-001, CD-001, AD-002 (representative sample)
- **Output:** `/foundations/tokens.md` + `/foundations/components.md`
- **Success:** 30-50 items, consensus core extracted

**PHASE C-II: PROHIBITION EXTRACTION (Negative Rules)**
- **Timing:** 2-3 hours
- **Agents:** 1 enablement-focused extractor
- **Input:** All soul documentation, prior research on violations
- **Output:** `/foundations/prohibitions.md`
- **Success:** 8-12 prohibitions documented with rationale

**PHASE C-III: MECHANISM EXTRACTION (Techniques)**
- **Timing:** 6-8 hours
- **Agents:** 2-3 parallel extractors
- **Input:** All explorations + tension-test layouts
- **Output:** `/techniques/mechanisms.md`
- **Success:** 12-20 mechanisms, separated from metaphors
- **CRITICAL GATE:** Commit to mechanism catalog before case studies

**PHASE C-IV: CASE STUDY DOCUMENTATION (Patterns)**
- **Timing:** 12-16 hours
- **Agents:** 1-2 serial documenters (NOT parallel)
- **Input:** Full explorations (DD-001 through AD-006)
- **Output:** `/case-studies/` (8-15 pattern files)
- **Success:** All use anti-prescription template, mechanisms vs metaphor split clear
- **CRITICAL FRAMING:** "You are documenting PROOF, not creating TEMPLATES"

**PHASE C-V: DECISION RULE DOCUMENTATION (Fill Gaps)**
- **Timing:** 4-6 hours
- **Agents:** 1-2 guideline documenters
- **Input:** Adversarial review gap list (Section 3.6)
- **Output:** `/guidelines/` (semantic rules, responsive strategy, usage criteria)
- **Success:** 7-10 decision rules documented

**TOTAL TIME: 32-45 hours (4-6 days)**

### 8.3 The Anti-Gravity Configuration (Essential 4)

**DEPLOY THESE MECHANISMS (Minimum Viable):**

**M1. Phase-Gated Library Access** (structural)
- Patterns in `/case-studies/` (separate directory)
- Vocabulary extractors CANNOT read patterns (directory separation)

**M2. Dual-File Split** (structural)
- `/techniques/mechanisms.md` (reusable techniques)
- `/case-studies/[PATTERN].md` (full explorations)
- NEVER mix mechanisms with patterns in same file

**M5. Binary Sequential Rules** (procedural)
- "You MUST extract in this order: Vocabulary → Mechanisms → Patterns"
- "DO NOT read case-studies/ until vocabulary extraction complete"
- Binary rule (not judgment) → 100% compliance expected

**M6. Divergence Mandate** (procedural)
- Success = "novel extraction approach" not "optimal execution"
- "You are EXPECTED to derive new categories NOT in Wave 1"
- Convergence with Wave 1 requires STRONG justification

**IF TIME PERMITS, ADD:**

**M3. Anti-Prescription Headers** (structural)
- All case studies use template from Section 4.5
- "⚠️ NOT A TEMPLATE" warning before content

**M9. Divergence Verification Gate** (procedural)
- Phase C-IVa: "Compare your extraction categories to Wave 1. If identical, justify or regenerate."

**M12. Jazz Catalog Framing** (hybrid)
- "Wave 1 produced 5 extractions. Learn them, then derive your own."
- Library as proof gallery, not template catalog

### 8.4 The Documentation Standard (Templates)

**ALL MECHANISMS use this format:**

```markdown
## Mechanism: [Name]

**Type:** [Depth encoding / Layout technique / etc.]
**Reusability:** UNIVERSAL / CONTEXT-SPECIFIC

**The Pattern:**
[Description of technique — what it IS]

**Examples Where This Worked:**
- [Source 1 with context]
- [Source 2 with context]

**How to Apply:**
1. [Step 1 — specific guidance]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Test criteria]

✅ Extract: [What's reusable]
❌ Don't extract: [What's context-specific]
```

**ALL CASE STUDIES use anti-prescription template (Section 4.5):**
- ⚠️ WARNING first
- Tension narrative (not criteria)
- Search story (not recipe)
- Mechanisms vs metaphor split
- Divergence assignment

### 8.5 Success Criteria for Phase C

**PHASE C SUCCEEDS IF:**

1. ✅ **Consensus core extracted** (16 items minimum)
2. ✅ **Vocabulary before patterns** (sequence verified)
3. ✅ **Mechanisms separated** (2 files: techniques/ + case-studies/)
4. ✅ **Anti-prescription template used** (all case studies)
5. ✅ **Prohibitions documented** (8+ negative rules)
6. ✅ **Decision rules documented** (7+ when-to-use criteria)
7. ✅ **Anti-gravity mechanisms deployed** (Essential 4 minimum)

**PHASE C FAILS IF:**

1. ❌ Extraction count diverges wildly from 30-40 (either under-extraction <20 or over-extraction >60)
2. ❌ Patterns documented before vocabulary (sequence violated)
3. ❌ Mechanisms mixed with patterns (dual-file split violated)
4. ❌ Case studies use prescriptive format ("When to use" instead of "Tension that produced")
5. ❌ Prohibitions omitted (enablement lens ignored)
6. ❌ Decision rule gaps unfilled (semantic rules still missing)

### 8.6 Post-Phase C Validation

**AFTER EXTRACTION, VALIDATE:**

**Validation 1: Convergence Check**
- Compare Phase C extraction to Wave 1 consensus core (16 items)
- **Success:** 90%+ overlap on Tier 1 items
- **Failure:** <70% overlap → extraction lens incorrect

**Validation 2: Divergence Check**
- Compare Phase C categories to Wave 1 lenses
- **Success:** NEW categories or novel lens application
- **Failure:** Exact repetition of frequency lens → pattern-matching

**Validation 3: Gap Check**
- Verify all 7+ missing semantic rules documented (Section 3.6)
- **Success:** All gaps filled
- **Failure:** Gaps remain → incomplete extraction

**Validation 4: Anti-Gravity Check**
- Verify Essential 4 mechanisms deployed
- **Success:** M1, M2, M5, M6 all present in documentation
- **Failure:** <3 mechanisms → gravity risk remains

**Validation 5: Usage Check** (LATER — after Phase F pilot)
- Build 3 new pages using extracted library
- Measure pattern-matching rate vs novel metaphors
- **Success:** 2/3 pages use novel metaphors (not library patterns)
- **Failure:** 3/3 pages pattern-match → anti-gravity mechanisms failed

## 9. FINAL SYNTHESIS — The Core Insight

### The Epistemological Finding

**Extraction is CONSTRUCTION disguised as DISCOVERY.**

All 5 Wave 1 agents thought they were FINDING patterns in the material.

Actually, they were CREATING patterns through:
- The categories they brought (callout, frequency, soul)
- The thresholds they set (3+, 80%, blocking)
- The values they held (reusability, identity, enablement)
- The lenses they applied (efficiency, expression, coherence)

**This doesn't make extraction INVALID.**

**It makes extraction INTERPRETIVE.**

### The Practical Implication

**There is NO SINGLE CORRECT extraction.**

Different purposes require different lenses:
- Stability → Frequency lens (42-45 items)
- Minimalism → Enablement lens (10 items)
- Identity → Soul lens (27-29 items)
- Creativity → Generative lens (9 meta-patterns)

**Phase C must CHOOSE based on PURPOSE.**

**RECOMMENDATION: Identity + Enablement Hybrid (30-40 items)**

### The Methodology Insight

**The prior extraction (45/18/12/8) mixed incompatible ontologies.**

You cannot add:
- 45 tokens (values)
- 18 components (implementations)
- 12 mechanisms (techniques)
- 8 patterns (compositions)

These are LAYERS, not additive items.

**The correct structure: 6-layer ontology (Section 3.1)**

### The Anti-Gravity Principle

**Pattern gravity is defeated through ARCHITECTURAL POSITIONING, not information restriction.**

Agents can have access to 100+ patterns and STILL generate fresh compositions IF:
1. **TIMING:** Patterns consulted AFTER derivation (M1, M5, M11)
2. **FRAMING:** Patterns positioned as gallery not menu (M3, M12)
3. **SEPARATION:** Mechanisms split from metaphors (M2)
4. **ENFORCEMENT:** Divergence required and verified (M6, M9)

**Volume doesn't cause gravity. Positioning does.**

### The Honest Assessment

**HIGH CONFIDENCE:**
- 3-item consensus core (border-radius: 0, box-shadow: none, --color-primary)
- Extraction is construction (fundamental epistemology)
- Timing > volume (rigidity synthesis validation)

**MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:**
- 16-item confident core (multi-lens convergence)
- 12 anti-gravity mechanisms will work (theory is robust)
- Reframing eliminates gravity (needs testing)

**LOW CONFIDENCE:**
- Exact mechanism bundle (Essential 4 vs Robust 7 vs All 12)
- Two-phase prompting necessity (M11 — architecturally complex)
- Anti-prescription warnings effectiveness (agents might ignore)

**REQUIRES EMPIRICAL TESTING:**
- 4-variant validation test (Section 7.6)
- Binary rule compliance in THIS context
- Optimal lens for Phase C

### The Process Knowledge

**The MOST IMPORTANT extraction is PROCESS, not OUTPUT.**

**Wave 1 revealed HOW extraction works:**
- Lenses create categories
- Categories shape findings
- Findings reflect values
- Values are constructed
- Construction masquerades as discovery

**Understanding THIS enables robust extraction.**

**Ignoring THIS produces brittle libraries.**

### The Final Recommendation

**FOR PHASE C EXTRACTION:**

1. **CHOOSE lens explicitly** — Identity + Enablement hybrid
2. **EXTRACT in sequence** — Vocab → Mechanisms → Patterns (timing control)
3. **SEPARATE mechanisms from metaphors** — Dual-file split (M2)
4. **FRAME patterns as proof** — Anti-prescription template (M3)
5. **ENFORCE divergence** — Binary sequential rules (M5, M6)
6. **DOCUMENT process** — How construction happens, not just what's extracted

**Expected output:**
- 30-40 items (16 consensus + 8 prohibitions + 6-16 additional)
- 6-layer ontology (not additive count)
- Anti-gravity mechanisms deployed (Essential 4 minimum)
- Process knowledge captured (how lenses work)

**Success criteria:**
- Consensus core extracted (90%+ overlap with 16 items)
- Novel approach (divergence from Wave 1 lenses)
- Gaps filled (7+ semantic rules documented)
- Anti-gravity deployed (M1, M2, M5, M6 present)

## THE MOST VALUABLE FINDING

**The most valuable extraction from Wave 1 isn't WHAT they extracted.**

**It's HOW extraction works:**

- Lenses create categories
- Categories shape findings
- Findings reflect values
- Values are constructed
- Construction masquerades as discovery

**This PROCESS KNOWLEDGE enables:**
- Future extractions with different lenses
- Adaptation to new contexts
- Critical evaluation of libraries
- Continuous evolution

**The PATTERNS will become obsolete.**

**The PROCESS remains.**

# Experiment Prompt: Dynamic Agent

You are participating in a design system analysis experiment. Your ONLY task is to analyze the design system whose source files are provided below and produce a detailed written analysis.

You have NO access to any files beyond what is included in this prompt. Everything you need is here. Do not attempt to read, search, or access any external resources.

## DESIGN SYSTEM SOURCE FILES

The following are the actual source files of a design system. Read them carefully and form your own understanding of what this system IS — its character, its values, its constraints, its possibilities.

### FILE 1: prohibitions.md
```
{{PROHIBITIONS_CONTENT}}
```

### FILE 2: soul-constraints.md
```
{{SOUL_CONSTRAINTS_CONTENT}}
```

### FILE 3: tokens.css
```css
{{TOKENS_CONTENT}}
```

## YOUR TASK

Based ONLY on the source files above, write a thorough analysis covering ALL of the following:

1. **Character**: What is this design system's character? Not just its properties — its personality, its attitude, its stance toward content and readers. What kind of entity is it?

2. **Internal Tensions**: Where does this system contradict itself? Where do its own values pull in opposing directions? Identify at least 2 genuine internal tensions.

3. **What It Enables**: What kinds of compositional moves does this system make EASY or NATURAL? What does it want you to do?

4. **What It Refuses**: What does this system reject? Not just what's prohibited — what is philosophically incompatible with its character?

5. **Generative Constraints**: Pick 2-3 constraints and explain how each one GENERATES design possibilities rather than just preventing them.

6. **Compositional Opportunities**: If you were building a content page in this system, what are the richest areas for creative composition? Where does the system leave room for the builder to make meaningful choices?

7. **Vocabulary Landscape**: Map what this system can express WELL vs what it STRUGGLES to express. Where is it fluent? Where is it limited?

8. **Surprise**: What, if anything, surprised you about this system? What is unexpected or counterintuitive?

Write 400-600 words. Be specific and concrete — reference actual values, properties, and relationships from the source files.

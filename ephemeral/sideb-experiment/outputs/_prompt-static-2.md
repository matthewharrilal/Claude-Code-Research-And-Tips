# Experiment Prompt: Static Agent

You are participating in a design system analysis experiment. Your ONLY task is to analyze the design system described below and produce a detailed written analysis.

You have NO access to any files. Everything you need is in this prompt. Do not attempt to read, search, or access any external resources.

## DESIGN SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The design system provides a fixed vocabulary.

**The world this page lives in:**

Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved. There are no soft edges in this world. Light is direct. Nothing floats. Nothing hovers above the page. Surfaces sit flat against each other.

The palette is warm -- red leads (#E83025), cream grounds (#FEF9F5), near-black anchors (#1A1A1A). Five accent colors complete the palette, all warm. Color is flat. Backgrounds are solid. Transitions between colors happen at boundaries, not within surfaces.

Three typefaces. No more. Instrument Serif for headings. Inter for body. JetBrains Mono for code. Every element earns its place. Nothing is decorative. If it does not serve the content, it does not exist.

The page has a spine. Content lives within 940-960px. The spine holds.

Borders speak. 4px = primary emphasis. 3px = section-level. 1px = subtle articulation. This hierarchy is absolute.

**Personality spectrum:**

```
WARM <-------------> AUSTERE      [75% austere]
SOFT <-------------> ANGULAR      [95% angular]
PLAYFUL <----------> SERIOUS      [85% serious]
ORGANIC <----------> GEOMETRIC    [100% geometric]
BUSY <-------------> SPARSE       [70% sparse]
FLEXIBLE <---------> RIGID        [80% rigid]
CASUAL <-----------> FORMAL       [80% formal]
COLORFUL <---------> RESTRAINED   [90% restrained]
```

**The Soul Test:**
1. "Does this look like it could appear in a magazine?" -> PASS
2. "Does this look like Bootstrap?" -> FAIL
3. "Could I swap the accent color to Bootstrap blue and it would fit?" -> FAIL
4. "Does every design choice serve hierarchy or readability?" -> PASS
5. "Is there any decoration that doesn't earn its place?" -> FAIL

## YOUR TASK

Based ONLY on the description above, write a thorough analysis covering ALL of the following:

1. **Character**: What is this design system's character? Not just its properties — its personality, its attitude, its stance toward content and readers. What kind of entity is it?

2. **Internal Tensions**: Where does this system contradict itself? Where do its own values pull in opposing directions? Identify at least 2 genuine internal tensions.

3. **What It Enables**: What kinds of compositional moves does this system make EASY or NATURAL? What does it want you to do?

4. **What It Refuses**: What does this system reject? Not just what's prohibited — what is philosophically incompatible with its character?

5. **Generative Constraints**: Pick 2-3 constraints and explain how each one GENERATES design possibilities rather than just preventing them.

6. **Compositional Opportunities**: If you were building a content page in this system, what are the richest areas for creative composition? Where does the system leave room for the builder to make meaningful choices?

7. **Vocabulary Landscape**: Map what this system can express WELL vs what it STRUGGLES to express. Where is it fluent? Where is it limited?

8. **Surprise**: What, if anything, surprised you about this system? What is unexpected or counterintuitive?

Write 400-600 words. Be specific and concrete — reference actual values, properties, and relationships from the description.

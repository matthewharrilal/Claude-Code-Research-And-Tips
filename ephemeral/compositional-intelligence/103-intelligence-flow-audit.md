# Intelligence Flow Audit: 55-Cell Matrix (11 Boundaries x 5 Intelligence Levels)

**Agent:** Intelligence Flow Auditor (Opus 4.6)
**Task:** #103
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Sources:** PV2-PIPELINE-DIAGRAM.md (canonical), Report 86 (intelligence hierarchy), Report 74 (bridging tissue), Report 83 (compositional stack inherent)

---

## PURPOSE

This audit constructs a 55-cell matrix showing EXACTLY what happens to each of the 5 intelligence levels at each of the 11 boundary crossings in PV2. It then compares this matrix against the diagram's own Intelligence Heatmap (lines 82-128) and the comparison table's claim that "L1-L4 enforced" (line 876).

## DEFINITIONS

### Intelligence Levels (from Report 86)

| Level | Name | What It Governs | PA-05 Correspondence |
|-------|------|----------------|---------------------|
| L1 | Perception Thresholds | Can you SEE the differences? | Prevents 1.5/4 (FLAT) |
| L2 | Scales (5 zoom levels) | Is the pattern visible at each zoom? | Enables 2/4 (STYLED) |
| L3 | Channels (6 CSS groups) | Is the pattern expressed through multiple properties? | Enables 2.5/4 (STYLED+) |
| L4 | Multi-Coherence | Do channels reinforce the same semantic direction? | Enables 3/4 (COMPOSED) |
| L5 | Anti-Scale Model | Does every decision serve the governing principle? | Enables 4/4 (DESIGNED) |

### Classification Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **PRESENT** | This level crosses this boundary intact -- full fidelity |
| **COMPRESSED** | This level crosses but loses fidelity (partial survival) |
| **ABSENT** | This level does not cross this boundary at all |
| **FIXED** | Was ABSENT or COMPRESSED in original PV2; now PRESENT or improved due to investigation fixes |

## THE 55-CELL MATRIX

### Boundary 1: Content -> TC Planner

**Nature:** CONSTRUCTIVE (format translation, no fix needed)

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | TC reads content and will apply perception thresholds from embedded knowledge. Content itself has no L1 (thresholds are pipeline artifacts). But L1 is not degraded -- it has not yet been created. Rating: N/A -> PRESENT (thresholds enter at TC). |
| L2 | PRESENT | TC Phase 0 produces section inventory which directly feeds scale identification. Content structure (sections, headings, components) maps to Navigation/Page/Section/Component/Character scales. |
| L3 | ABSENT | Content has no channel information. Channels are CSS constructs that TC will CREATE, not inherit. |
| L4 | ABSENT | Multi-coherence is a CSS coordination property. Content has no channel directions to coordinate. |
| L5 | COMPRESSED | Content carries semantic density (meaning per section) and spatial structure (section lengths/density). Restraint and spatial confidence are pipeline properties, not content properties. The content's inherent density information survives but the evaluative framework does not exist here. |

### Boundary 2: TC Internal (Phase 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3.5)

**Nature:** CONSTRUCTIVE (intentional funnel)

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | Perception thresholds are embedded in TC's knowledge. They persist through all internal phases without degradation. |
| L2 | PRESENT | TC Phase 4.7 produces the 5-row Fractal Echo Table (per Report 83). Scale awareness is CREATED at this stage. It exists fully within TC's cognition. |
| L3 | PRESENT | TC selects mechanisms across 5 categories (S/T/M/B/R). The 6-channel transition table skeleton is CREATED here (per fix). Channel awareness is at its peak inside TC. |
| L4 | COMPRESSED | TC assigns semantic directions per boundary and channel counts. But multi-coherence as BINDING (channels shifting together in same direction) is conceptual at this stage -- TC can specify it but cannot verify it against CSS. Direction words exist; CSS bindings do not yet. |
| L5 | COMPRESSED | TC's Phase 1 multi-axis questioning explores 9-14 axes. The anti-scale model's components (semantic density, restraint, spatial confidence) are IMPLICIT in TC's reasoning but not EXPLICITLY invoked. TC does not produce a restraint log or mass distribution table. L5 is present as cognitive process, absent as operational artifact. |

### Boundary 3: TC -> _build-recipe.md [CRITICAL]

**Nature:** Was DESTRUCTIVE (~20:1 compression), now CONSTRUCTIVE after fix (~8:1)

| Level | Status (BEFORE fix) | Status (AFTER fix) | Evidence |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | PRESENT | Threshold values (hex colors, px values) survive as numbers in build recipe. Numbers cannot be paraphrased away. SC-09/10/11 reference values are embedded. |
| L2 | ABSENT | **FIXED** -> PRESENT | **BEFORE:** Build plan had zero scale coverage table. TC's 5-row fractal echo plan evaporated into prose mechanism names. **AFTER:** Fractal Echo Table is a MANDATORY deliverable in _build-recipe.md. 5 rows, pattern direction, CSS evidence per scale. |
| L3 | COMPRESSED | **FIXED** -> PRESENT | **BEFORE:** Only chromatic channel specified (hex values). Other 5 channels reduced to mechanism names. **AFTER:** 6-column Transition Table with per-boundary x per-channel values. Chromatic fully specified, 2-3 additional channels with direction words, remaining channels scaffolded. |
| L4 | ABSENT | **FIXED** -> COMPRESSED | **BEFORE:** Zero multi-coherence information. Mechanism names do not encode directional binding. **AFTER:** Transition table includes semantic direction per boundary and channel count (must be >= 3). But directional COHERENCE is direction words, not verified CSS bindings. Improved from ABSENT to COMPRESSED. |
| L5 | ABSENT | ABSENT | Neither before nor after fix does the build recipe encode the anti-scale model. No restraint log targets, no spatial confidence guidance, no semantic density framework. The formula exists in memory and research only. |

### Boundary 4: Build Recipe -> Handoff Gate

**Nature:** NECESSARY (pass-through validation, zero transformation)

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | Handoff Gate check #2 verifies BG colors >= 15 RGB delta. L1 explicitly validated. |
| L2 | **FIXED** -> PRESENT | NEW check #6: Fractal Echo Table present with 5 rows + consistent pattern direction. L2 explicitly validated. Was ABSENT (no check existed). |
| L3 | **FIXED** -> PRESENT | NEW check #7: Transition Table valid (>= 3 channels shift at every zone boundary). NEW check #8: Channel map complete (all 6 channels have before/after values). L3 explicitly validated. |
| L4 | **FIXED** -> COMPRESSED | Check #7 validates channel COUNT (>= 3 per boundary) but not directional COHERENCE. The gate cannot verify that 3 shifting channels all say "DEEPENING." It can verify that 3 channels SHIFT. Partial L4 enforcement. |
| L5 | ABSENT | No handoff gate check addresses semantic density, restraint, or spatial confidence. Report 83 explicitly states: "L5: ABSENT (not enforceable at gate level -- judgment domain)." The diagram agrees (line 363). |

### Boundary 5: Handoff -> Builder (Multi-file context)

**Nature:** Was DESTRUCTIVE (multi-file synthesis overhead), now CONSTRUCTIVE after fix

| Level | Status (BEFORE fix) | Status (AFTER fix) | Evidence |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | PRESENT | Threshold values in tokens.css and recipe template. Numbers survive multi-file context. |
| L2 | ABSENT | **FIXED** -> COMPRESSED | **BEFORE:** No fractal echo table in builder input. **AFTER:** Fractal Echo Table is one of 8 builder input files. But LLM attention competition means scale cross-references compete with 1,300 lines of other material. Builder brief helps prioritize but cannot guarantee active attention at each phase. |
| L3 | COMPRESSED | **FIXED** -> COMPRESSED (improved) | **BEFORE:** Mechanism catalog names channels but builder must mentally merge catalog + recipe + tokens across 6 files. **AFTER:** Transition table has per-channel values that builder reads directly. Template + instance share structure, reducing synthesis overhead. Still COMPRESSED because multi-file attention limits persist. |
| L4 | ABSENT | **FIXED** -> COMPRESSED | **BEFORE:** Zero multi-coherence information reached builder. **AFTER:** Transition table with direction words and channel counts reaches builder. Builder brief explains failure mode. But multi-coherence requires SIMULTANEOUS attention to multiple channels at each boundary -- this competes with sequential recipe phases. |
| L5 | ABSENT | ABSENT | No builder input file encodes the anti-scale model. The operational proxies (restraint log, mass distribution, stop check) are in the RECIPE as text instructions, not in the builder's reference files. The recipe mentions them; the builder may or may not attend to them. |

### Boundary 6: Builder -> HTML/CSS Output

**Nature:** CONSTRUCTIVE (generative -- CSS IS the intelligence)

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | Perception thresholds manifest as CSS values: hex colors with >= 15 RGB delta, font-sizes with >= 2px delta, padding with <= 108px stacking. These are PRESENT in the CSS because the recipe specifies them and gates verify them. |
| L2 | COMPRESSED | Builder may or may not echo the pattern at all 5 scales. Recipe phases reference the fractal echo table per-phase, but each phase addresses one CSS channel, not one scale. Scale coherence depends on builder holding the echo table in active memory across 6+ phases. |
| L3 | COMPRESSED | Builder writes CSS channel-by-channel (Phase 3 chromatic, Phase 4 structural, Phase 5 typographic). Multi-channel presence depends on builder completing all phases. Each channel IS present in the CSS if the builder follows the recipe, but the ENSEMBLE quality depends on Phase 3.5 binding. |
| L4 | COMPRESSED | The completed transition table (Phase 3.5) provides the binding contract. But the builder executes Phases 4-6 AFTER Phase 3.5, and must hold the binding contract in active attention. Directional coherence in the final CSS depends on whether the builder FOLLOWED the table or deviated. Report 83 acknowledges this: "Phase 3.5 MITIGATES but does not RESOLVE the fundamental tension." |
| L5 | COMPRESSED | The recipe includes operational proxies (Name It test, restraint log, stop check, mass distribution). If the builder follows them, L5 intelligence appears in the CSS (fewer unjustified lines, spatial confidence, semantic density). If the builder skips Phase 0 restraint log or Phase 6 stop check, L5 is ABSENT. Advisory compliance. |

### Boundary 7: HTML -> Gate Runner (Programmatic Verification)

**Nature:** NECESSARY (measurement, pass-through)

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | SC-01 (container width), SC-02 (soul), SC-03 (fonts), SC-04 (palette), SC-05 (extremes), SC-09 (bg delta), SC-10 (stacked gap), SC-11 (typography delta), SC-12 (zone count). 9 gates covering all L1 thresholds. FULLY ENFORCED. |
| L2 | ABSENT | No gate checks scale coverage. SC-13 (as described in Report 83) checks direction correlation across scales, but the diagram (line 603) notes: "L2: ABSENT* (no gate checks scale coverage yet)." SC-13B identified as needed but not designed. The gate runner cannot verify that the pattern appears at 5 zoom levels. |
| L3 | COMPRESSED | SC-09 checks chromatic channel (bg delta). SC-11 checks typographic channel (font-size delta). SC-15 checks structural channel (border presence). That is 3 of 6 channels. Behavioral and Material channels have zero gates. |
| L4 | **FIXED** -> COMPRESSED | NEW SC-13 checks multi-coherence: >= 3 channels shift at every zone boundary. This is the channel COUNT gate. But it measures WHETHER channels shifted, not whether they shifted in the SAME DIRECTION. Diagram (line 595): "~70% confidence (can count shifts but not semantic coherence)." |
| L5 | ABSENT | No gate addresses semantic density, restraint, or spatial confidence. Report 83 proposes SC-15 (restraint log presence) and SC-16 (spatial confidence / mass distribution), but the diagram lists these as future/proposed. Currently zero L5 enforcement. |

### Boundary 8: HTML -> PA Auditors (Context Stripping)

**Nature:** NECESSARY (fresh-eyes isolation, intentional information loss)

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 | ABSENT | Correct by design. PA auditors evaluate PERCEPTION, not NUMBERS. They do not check "is the RGB delta >= 15?" They see "do these zones look different?" This is the right behavior -- L1 is threshold-based, PA is perception-based. |
| L2 | COMPRESSED | Auditors CAN see fractal self-similarity when it exists ("the same logic at every zoom level"). But they evaluate from screenshots without knowing WHICH scales were planned. 9 auditors seeing different zoom levels partially captures L2 but without the 5-scale framework. |
| L3 | COMPRESSED | Auditors CAN see multi-channel variation ("everything shifts as I scroll"). But they evaluate atmospherically, not channel-by-channel. Some channels (behavioral: hover states) cannot be seen in screenshots at all. |
| L4 | PRESENT | This is where PA excels. Auditors sense DESIGNED quality as implicit multi-coherence: "this page knows what it's doing" = channels working in ensemble. PA-05 3/4 (COMPOSED) directly corresponds to L4 presence. Fresh-eyes evaluation IS the gold standard for L4. |
| L5 | COMPRESSED | Auditors sense density x restraint x spatial confidence intuitively. PA-05 4/4 (DESIGNED) corresponds to L5. But individual auditors may not articulate the THREE COMPONENTS of L5 -- they may sense "designed" without distinguishing whether it's density, restraint, or confidence driving the impression. |

### Boundary 9: PA Reports -> PA Weaver (Report Synthesis)

**Nature:** CONSTRUCTIVE (convergence-based compression)

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 | ABSENT | PA reports do not contain threshold measurements. Correctly absent -- thresholds are gate-runner territory. |
| L2 | COMPRESSED | Convergent findings about scale presence survive (e.g., "7/9 auditors noted component-level echoing"). Minority scale observations may be lost. |
| L3 | COMPRESSED | Convergent findings about channel variety survive. Individual auditor nuances about specific channels may be lost in synthesis. |
| L4 | PRESENT | PA-05 score IS the convergent multi-coherence signal. 9 independent assessments of "does this feel COMPOSED/DESIGNED?" produce a high-signal convergent score. The weaver's synthesis PRESERVES L4 as the PA-05 number. |
| L5 | COMPRESSED | Auditors who sensed L5 quality may not articulate it distinctly from L4. The weaver synthesizes top findings; the nuance of "this page has restraint" vs "this page has coherence" may blur. |

### Boundary 10: PA Report -> Fix Cycle Builder

**Nature:** Was DESTRUCTIVE, now CONSTRUCTIVE after fix

| Level | Status (BEFORE fix) | Status (AFTER fix) | Evidence |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | PRESENT | Gate results provide exact measured values (RGB deltas, px values). Fix-cycle builder receives specific threshold violations. |
| L2 | ABSENT | COMPRESSED | **BEFORE:** No scale information in PA report. **AFTER:** _fix-instructions.md (orchestrator-generated) can map perceptual issues to scale-specific recipe phases. But orchestrator may not always correctly diagnose scale gaps. |
| L3 | COMPRESSED | **FIXED** -> COMPRESSED (improved) | **BEFORE:** PA says "feels monotone" -- no channel-specific diagnosis. **AFTER:** Gate results identify which channels passed/failed (SC-09 bg, SC-11 typography, SC-13 multi-coherence count). Fix builder knows WHICH channels need work. |
| L4 | ABSENT | **FIXED** -> COMPRESSED | **BEFORE:** PA says "doesn't feel composed" with no compositional diagnosis. **AFTER:** _fix-instructions.md links PA symptoms to transition table violations. But directional coherence issues are hard to diagnose from gate counts alone. |
| L5 | ABSENT | ABSENT | Neither PA report nor gate results encode L5 diagnosis. "Lacks restraint" or "spatial confidence is low" are not in the vocabulary of either input. The fix-cycle builder has no L5 guidance. |

### Boundary 11: Fix Cycle -> Final Output

**Nature:** CONSTRUCTIVE (revision)

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 | PRESENT | Gate-generated fix recipes specify exact CSS fixes for threshold violations. L1 fixes are precise and lossless. |
| L2 | COMPRESSED | If scale issues were identified (via fix-instructions), builder addresses them. But fix cycles prioritize top-3 issues, and scale gaps may not make the top 3 if threshold or multi-coherence issues are more severe. |
| L3 | COMPRESSED | Channel-specific gate failures get fix recipes. But the fix cycle addresses top-3 issues in max 3 cycles. Channel gaps ranked below top 3 are deferred. |
| L4 | COMPRESSED | Multi-coherence improvements require multiple simultaneous channel adjustments -- harder in a targeted fix cycle than in initial build. Fix cycles tend to address individual channel failures, not ensemble coordination. |
| L5 | ABSENT | Fix cycles do not address L5. No fix recipe targets semantic density, restraint ratio, or spatial confidence. These are first-pass properties, not fixable post-hoc. |

## COMPARISON: MATRIX vs DIAGRAM CLAIMS

### Diagram's Intelligence Heatmap (Lines 82-128)

The diagram provides a 7-stage heatmap using [#####] notation. Converting to my L1-L5 framework:

| Stage (Diagram) | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | Diagram's Claim |
|------------------|----|----|----|----|----| --- |
| Content.md | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | No intelligence |
| TC Planner | FULL | FULL | HIGH | MODERATE | LOW | L1-L3 strong, L4-L5 weaker |
| _build-recipe.md | FULL | LOW | MODERATE | MINIMAL | ABSENT | Critical loss point |
| Builder Input | FULL | MINIMAL | MODERATE | MINIMAL | ABSENT | Further degradation |
| CSS/HTML Output | HIGH | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | ABSENT | Builder-dependent |
| Gate Runner | FULL | ABSENT* | MINIMAL | NEW SC-13 | ABSENT | Gates catch L1 + partial L4 |
| PA Auditors | ABSENT+ | MODERATE | MODERATE | HIGH | MODERATE | PA excels at L4 |

### Where the Diagram is ACCURATE

1. **L1 is consistently FULL/PRESENT through planning and gates.** My matrix confirms L1 is PRESENT at every boundary except B8 (PA, correctly ABSENT) and B9 (weaver, correctly ABSENT). The diagram's claim of L1 strength is accurate.

2. **L5 is consistently ABSENT from operational pipeline.** My matrix confirms L5 is ABSENT at B3, B4, B5, B7, B10, B11 and only COMPRESSED (not PRESENT) at B2, B6, B8, B9. The diagram correctly identifies L5 as judgment-domain only.

3. **B3 (TC -> Build Recipe) is the critical loss point.** My matrix confirms L2 and L4 were ABSENT here before fixes. The diagram (line 98) correctly marks this as "CRITICAL LOSS POINT."

4. **PA auditors have HIGH L4 but ABSENT L1.** My matrix confirms PA excels at multi-coherence perception (PRESENT) but correctly does not measure thresholds (ABSENT). The diagram's heatmap for PA is accurate.

5. **The "FIXES" section (lines 124-128) correctly identifies what the new artifacts do.** Fractal Echo Table -> L2, Transition Table -> L3, Multi-coherence binding -> L4, Anti-scale remains ABSENT. All confirmed by my cell-by-cell analysis.

### Where the Diagram OVERSTATES

1. **L2 at Builder Input: Diagram says "MINIMAL" but reality is "COMPRESSED."** The diagram (line 100) shows L2 as [#....] (MINIMAL) at builder input. After the fix, the fractal echo table IS one of the 8 builder input files. But LLM attention competition means the 5-row table competes with 1,300 lines. I rate this COMPRESSED (partial survival with fidelity loss), which is slightly more generous than "MINIMAL" but acknowledges the attention competition problem. **Verdict: Diagram is approximately correct -- difference is semantic, not substantive.**

2. **L3 at Gate Runner: Diagram says "MINIMAL" but my analysis says "COMPRESSED."** The diagram (line 106) shows L3 as [#....] (MINIMAL) at gate runner. But SC-09 (chromatic), SC-11 (typographic), and SC-15 (structural) verify 3 of 6 channels programmatically. 3/6 = 50% channel coverage. I call this COMPRESSED (significant but not full). **Verdict: Diagram slightly understates gate runner L3 capability.** The gate runner covers half the channels, which is more than "MINIMAL."

3. **The diagram's "FIXES" claim that Fractal Echo Table makes L2 [###..] (MODERATE) at builder level.** My matrix rates the FIXED L2 at B5 as COMPRESSED, not MODERATE-to-PRESENT. The table exists as an input file, but there is no evidence that LLM builders reliably hold 5-scale coherence across 6+ recipe phases. The fractal echo table is a necessary but not sufficient condition for L2 survival. **Verdict: Diagram's post-fix L2 claim is optimistic.**

### Where the Diagram UNDERSTATES

1. **L4 at PA Auditors: Diagram says [####.] (HIGH) but my analysis says PRESENT (full).** PA-05 3/4 (COMPOSED) IS the definition of L4. Fresh-eyes auditors evaluating "does this page feel composed?" are performing the GOLD STANDARD L4 assessment. 9 independent auditors provide convergent L4 measurement that exceeds any programmatic gate. **Verdict: Diagram should show L4 at PA as FULL, not HIGH.**

2. **L5 at PA Auditors: Diagram says [###..] (MODERATE) but could be argued as HIGH.** PA-05 4/4 (DESIGNED) directly corresponds to L5. While individual auditors may not articulate the three anti-scale factors separately, the ENSEMBLE of 9 auditors implicitly evaluates density x restraint x spatial confidence through perceptual impressions. The PA is arguably the ONLY reliable L5 measurement. **Verdict: Diagram's L5 at PA is reasonable but conservative.**

3. **Gate Runner L4: Diagram says "NEW SC-13" without a rating.** SC-13 is a genuine L4 enforcement mechanism that did not exist before. At ~70% confidence (can count shifts but not semantic coherence), I rate this COMPRESSED. The diagram should give it a bar rating, not just "NEW." **Verdict: Diagram should show L4 at Gate Runner as [##...] (LOW) or [###..] (MODERATE) -- approximately LOW given the 70% confidence.**

---

## CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: Is "L1-L4 enforced" Accurate?

The comparison table (line 876) claims Updated PV2 has "L1-L4 enforced (gates + artifacts)."

### L1: ENFORCED -- CONFIRMED

L1 is the strongest layer. 9 programmatic gates (SC-01 through SC-12) provide binary verification of all perception thresholds. The handoff gate validates background deltas. The recipe embeds threshold values. L1 is PRESENT at every relevant boundary.

**Verdict: L1 enforcement claim is ACCURATE.**

### L2: PARTIALLY ENFORCED -- OVERSTATED

L2 enforcement depends on:
- Fractal Echo Table in _build-recipe.md (FIXED at B3 -- now PRESENT)
- Handoff Gate check #6 (FIXED at B4 -- now PRESENT)
- Recipe SCALE CHECK per phase (advisory -- builder compliance uncertain)
- Gate SC-13 (direction correlation -- PROPOSED but not yet fully designed for scale coverage)

The critical gap: **no programmatic gate verifies scale coverage in the output HTML.** SC-13 checks direction correlation but not whether all 5 scales are expressed. The fractal echo table ensures the PLAN has 5 scales, but nothing verifies the EXECUTION has 5 scales.

L2 is PRESENT at planning boundaries (B3, B4) but only COMPRESSED at execution and verification boundaries (B5, B6, B7). The diagram itself acknowledges this: "L2: ABSENT* (no gate checks scale coverage yet)" at the gate runner (line 603).

**Verdict: L2 "enforced" is PARTIALLY TRUE. L2 is enforced at PLANNING boundaries (the plan must include 5 scales). L2 is NOT enforced at EXECUTION boundaries (the output is not verified for 5-scale coverage). Calling this "enforced" is generous.**

### L3: PARTIALLY ENFORCED -- APPROXIMATELY CORRECT

L3 enforcement depends on:
- 6-column Transition Table in _build-recipe.md (FIXED at B3 -- now PRESENT)
- Handoff Gate check #7 and #8 (FIXED at B4 -- now PRESENT)
- SC-09, SC-11, SC-15 verify 3/6 channels programmatically
- SC-14 (channel activity) proposed but checks count, not quality

L3 is PRESENT at planning boundaries and COMPRESSED at verification. 3 of 6 channels have programmatic gates. Behavioral and Material channels are unverified.

**Verdict: L3 "enforced" is APPROXIMATELY TRUE. Planning enforcement is strong (transition table + handoff gate). Execution enforcement covers 50% of channels. Calling this "enforced" is reasonable with the caveat that Behavioral and Material channels slip through.**

### L4: PARTIALLY ENFORCED -- OVERSTATED

L4 enforcement depends on:
- Transition table with semantic directions (FIXED at B3 -- COMPRESSED, not PRESENT)
- Handoff gate channel count >= 3 (FIXED at B4 -- checks count not coherence)
- Phase 3.5 binding step (advisory -- builder compliance uncertain)
- SC-13 channel shift count (NEW -- checks count not direction)
- PA auditors (PRESENT -- PA IS L4 measurement)

The critical gap: **no gate verifies DIRECTIONAL coherence.** SC-13 counts whether 3+ channels shifted, not whether they shifted in the SAME DIRECTION. A page where background warms, borders LIGHTEN (contradictory), and padding opens (contradictory) would pass SC-13 (3 channels shifted) but fail L4 (directions disagree). The diagram acknowledges this: "~70% confidence (can count shifts but not semantic coherence)" (line 595).

L4 is COMPRESSED (not PRESENT) at every boundary except PA (B8/B9 where it is PRESENT). The planning artifacts enable L4 but do not guarantee it.

**Verdict: L4 "enforced" is OVERSTATED. L4 is enforced at ~70% confidence through channel count gates. The remaining 30% -- directional semantic coherence -- is only evaluated by PA auditors (who are the final check, not an enforcement mechanism). Calling L4 "enforced" conflates "verified by PA" with "structurally enforced."**

### L5: NOT ENFORCED -- CORRECTLY STATED AS ABSENT

The diagram correctly states L5 remains absent from the operational pipeline. The comparison table (line 876) says "L1-L4 enforced," implicitly acknowledging L5 is not.

**Verdict: L5 non-enforcement is CORRECTLY REPRESENTED.**

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

### Is "L1-L4 enforced" accurate?

**PARTIALLY ACCURATE, WITH SIGNIFICANT CAVEATS.**

| Level | Enforcement Status | Accuracy of "Enforced" Claim |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| L1 | FULLY ENFORCED (9 binary gates + handoff check) | **ACCURATE** |
| L2 | PLANNING ENFORCED, EXECUTION UNVERIFIED | **OVERSTATED** -- plan verified, output not |
| L3 | PLANNING ENFORCED, 50% EXECUTION VERIFIED | **APPROXIMATELY CORRECT** -- 3/6 channels gated |
| L4 | 70% ENFORCED (count not direction) | **OVERSTATED** -- counting shifts != verifying coherence |
| L5 | NOT ENFORCED | **CORRECTLY ABSENT** from claim |

A more accurate claim would be:

> "L1 fully enforced. L2-L3 enforced at planning boundaries, partially verified at execution. L4 partially enforced (~70% confidence). L5 absent."

Or more concisely:

> "L1 enforced, L2-L4 structurally scaffolded with gaps at execution verification."

The diagram's heatmap (lines 82-128) is actually MORE honest than the comparison table's summary claim. The heatmap shows the NUANCE (FULL vs HIGH vs MODERATE vs MINIMAL vs ABSENT per stage), while "L1-L4 enforced" flattens this into a binary that overstates L2 and L4 enforcement.

### The Enforcement Gap Pattern

Across all 5 levels, I observe a consistent pattern:

```
PLANNING ENFORCEMENT (B3, B4) > EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT (B6, B7) > FIX ENFORCEMENT (B10, B11)
```

Intelligence that is STRUCTURALLY PRESENT in planning artifacts (fractal echo table, transition table) degrades as it passes through:
1. Builder's LLM attention window (B5) -- multi-file competition
2. Builder's sequential execution (B6) -- channel-by-channel vs boundary-by-boundary
3. Gate runner's binary measurement (B7) -- count vs direction
4. Fix cycle's top-3 prioritization (B10) -- scale/L4 issues may not make top 3

The investigation fixes dramatically improved planning-level intelligence (L2 and L3 went from ABSENT to PRESENT at B3/B4). But EXECUTION-level intelligence remains COMPRESSED at best.

### Highest-Risk Intelligence Gap

**L4 directional coherence at the gate runner (B7).**

SC-13 can verify that 3+ channels shifted at each boundary. It CANNOT verify they shifted in the same semantic direction. This is the single largest gap between what the diagram claims ("L4 enforced") and what the architecture delivers (L4 counted, not verified for direction). A page with 3 channels shifting in contradictory directions passes all gates but fails PA.

The only L4 verification that catches directional incoherence is the PA audit (B8). This means L4 enforcement depends entirely on the PA catch-and-fix-cycle mechanism, not on structural prevention.

### Recommendation

The comparison table claim should be revised from:

> "L1-L4 enforced (gates + artifacts)"

To:

> "L1 enforced (gates). L2-L4 scaffolded (artifacts + partial gates). L5 judgment-only (PA)."

This accurately represents that:
- L1 has binary, blocking enforcement
- L2-L4 have structural scaffolding (artifacts must exist) but incomplete execution verification
- L5 is evaluated only by perceptual audit

## APPENDIX: Cell-by-Cell Concordance with Diagram Heatmap

For each of the diagram's 7-stage x 5-level heatmap cells, my concordance assessment:

| PA Auditors | L1 | ABSENT+ | ABSENT | AGREE |
| PA Auditors | L2 | MODERATE | COMPRESSED | AGREE |
| PA Auditors | L3 | MODERATE | COMPRESSED | AGREE |
| PA Auditors | L4 | HIGH | PRESENT | DISAGREE -- PA IS L4; should be FULL |
| PA Auditors | L5 | MODERATE | COMPRESSED | AGREE |

**Concordance summary:** 23/35 cells AGREE, 8 SLIGHT DISAGREE (semantic differences), 4 genuine DISAGREE.

The 4 genuine disagreements:
1. _build-recipe L2: Diagram shows pre-fix state; post-fix is PRESENT (fractal echo table mandatory)
2. _build-recipe L3: Diagram shows pre-fix state; post-fix is PRESENT (transition table mandatory)
3. CSS/HTML L5: Diagram says ABSENT; I rate COMPRESSED (recipe proxies may partially survive)
4. PA Auditors L4: Diagram says HIGH; I rate PRESENT/FULL (PA IS the L4 gold standard)

**END OF INTELLIGENCE FLOW AUDIT**

**Key Finding:** The diagram's "L1-L4 enforced" claim is accurate for L1, approximately correct for L3, and overstated for L2 and L4. The gap is consistently at execution verification: planning artifacts ensure intelligence ENTERS the builder, but gates cannot fully verify intelligence SURVIVED in the output. The PA audit remains the only reliable L4 verification, making the fix cycle (not structural prevention) the true L4 enforcement mechanism.

**Statistics:**
- Cells analyzed: 55 (11 boundaries x 5 levels)
- Before/after comparisons: 12 cells (3 boundaries with before/after split x 4 affected levels)
- Concordance with diagram: 23 AGREE, 8 SLIGHT DISAGREE, 4 DISAGREE out of 35 heatmap cells
- Sources cross-referenced: 4 primary documents (PV2 diagram, Reports 74, 83, 86)

# The World You Are Building In

Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved. There are no soft edges in this world -- angularity is confidence made visible.

Light is direct. Nothing floats. Nothing hovers above the page. Surfaces sit flat against each other, honest about being surfaces. Depth comes from spacing and borders, not from shadows or transparency.

The palette is warm. Red leads (#E83025), cream grounds (#FEF9F5), near-black anchors (#1A1A1A). Five accent colors serve semantic roles -- blue for information, green for guidance, coral for caution, amber for synthesis, purple for challenge. Color is flat. Backgrounds are solid. Transitions between colors happen at boundaries, not within surfaces. Every background satisfies R >= G >= B -- warmth is baked into the math.

Three typefaces. No more. Instrument Serif for headings -- editorial authority. Inter for body -- functional clarity. JetBrains Mono for code -- technical precision. Every element earns its place. If it does not serve the content, it does not exist.

The page has a spine. Content lives within 940-960px. The spine holds.

Borders speak in three weights: 4px for primary emphasis, 3px for section-level articulation, 1px for subtle separation. The 2px weight is absent -- the jump from 3 to 1 is deliberate. Hierarchy lives in that gap.

This world values restraint. Spacing breathes on a 4px rhythm. Tables use horizontal rules only -- vertical lines are prison bars. Density alternates: dense sections earn their breathing rooms, sparse sections earn their compression. The page is a conversation between weight and air.

Think of a well-edited magazine spread, not a software interface. Every design choice serves hierarchy or readability. If you could swap the accent color to Bootstrap blue and it would still fit, something has gone wrong.

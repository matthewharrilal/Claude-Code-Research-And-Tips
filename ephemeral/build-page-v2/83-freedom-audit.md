## 1. WINDOW 1 FREEDOM (Builder)

### Is the builder genuinely free?

**VERDICT: YES -- with one structural caveat.**

**Evidence of genuine freedom:**

1. **Receiving principle is generative, not prescriptive.** The 5-point receiving principle (SKILL.md lines 74-78) uses language of invitation and ownership:
   - "What excites you about this material?" (open inquiry)
   - "The metaphor is yours." (ownership declaration)
   - "this is your creative commitment, not a document for someone else" (internal orientation)
   - "They are tools, not instructions." (resource framing for vocabulary files)
   - "Your perception is the tiebreaker on every creative decision." (sovereignty)

2. **No quality targets or scores visible.** The builder receives zero numerical quality targets. No PA-05 scores, no mechanism counts, no "achieve X" language. The conventions are purely mechanical (container width, font names, color math) -- they constrain the engineering, not the composition.

3. **No gate thresholds visible.** The builder never sees GR-03, GR-05, GR-11, or any gate ID. The conventions encode the same constraints but without the compliance framing ("940-960px" vs "GR-03 FAIL if container outside 940-960px").

4. **Metaphor is fully self-derived.** The builder receives content, a world-description, and the TC skill pipeline. They derive their own metaphor through Phase 1-4. No metaphor is suggested, constrained, or pre-selected by the orchestrator.

5. **Vocabulary files are labeled as resources.** The mechanism catalog header reads "MECHANISMS -- YOUR TOOLS" and components reads "COMPONENT LIBRARY -- YOUR STARTING POINTS." These are RESOURCE framings, not REQUIREMENT framings. The build instruction reinforces: "Adapt components from the library. Do not invent from scratch when a component serves your purpose. Do not copy when your metaphor demands something different." (SKILL.md lines 161-163) -- this is balanced guidance that respects both efficiency and creative authority.

6. **World-description is generative.** The 17-line world-description (world-description.md) reads like prose, not rules. "Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved." establishes physics, not prohibitions. "Think of a well-edited magazine spread, not a software interface" gives creative orientation. The soul test is framed as "Does this look like it could appear in a magazine?" -- aspirational, not punitive.

7. **Build instructions are compositional, not checklist.** "Build from your conviction brief. Work boundary-by-boundary" is a METHOD, not a checklist. It describes HOW to think, not WHAT to produce.

8. **Reflection is genuinely introspective.** The 3-dimension reflection (CONVICTION, ALTERNATIVES, UNRESOLVED) asks about creative state, suppressed energy, and remaining tension. These are artist prompts, not compliance reports.

**The structural caveat:**

The TC skill itself (841 lines) contains substantial process structure -- 5 phases, gates, tests, evaluation criteria. Within the TC pipeline, the builder follows a structured creative process. This is analogous to a sonnet form -- the structure is enabling, not constraining. The key evidence: the TC skill explicitly states "You are CONSTRUCTING a composition, not DISCOVERING one" and "Multiple valid metaphors exist for the SAME content." The structure channels creativity rather than suppressing it.

However, the TC skill does contain prescriptive language within its process:
- "YOU MUST NOT read the following during Phases 0-3" (Step 0E, Library Access Prohibition)
- The Addition Test, BECAUSE test, SUBSTITUTION test are all gatekeeping mechanisms

These are PROCESS constraints (how to derive), not OUTCOME constraints (what to produce). The builder's creative freedom is in what metaphor they choose, what CSS they write, what composition they create -- the TC process constrains derivation methodology, not creative output. This is an appropriate use of structure.

**Compliance language scan in Window 1 prompt:**

| Phrase | Location | Context | Assessment |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| "You must produce 3 files" | SKILL.md line 81 | Output specification | PLUMBING -- not creative constraint |
| "Prohibited: border-radius, box-shadow..." | Conventions | Mechanical constraint | PHYSICS -- defines the world, not the art |
| "absorb these, do not checklist them" | SKILL.md line 135 | Meta-instruction | FREEDOM-SUPPORTING -- tells builder NOT to treat conventions as checklist |

**No red flags found in the builder creative window.**

## 2. PA AUDITOR FREEDOM (Information Isolation)

### Is information isolation genuine?

**VERDICT: YES -- isolation is rigorous and well-designed.**

**Evidence of genuine isolation:**

1. **Explicit isolation specification.** The SKILL.md (lines 336-337) states: "What auditors do NOT receive: gate results, builder's reflection, other auditor reports, conviction brief, mechanism catalog, components CSS, content markdown, any numerical targets." The prompt-templates.md (lines 283, 568-577) provides a full information isolation matrix confirming this.

2. **Auditors receive ONLY:**
   - Screenshot file paths
   - Receiving principle (5 points of perceptual orientation)
   - Section 0 protocol (cold look + scroll-through)
   - Their 4 questions (subset of 20)
   - Language constraint
   - Output file path

3. **No build context leaks.** The auditor prompt (SKILL.md lines 424-482) contains zero references to: metaphor, conviction brief, mechanism catalog, gate results, builder reflection, TC pipeline, or compositional theory.

4. **Language constraint is genuine perceptual enforcement.** Banning CSS vocabulary (px, rem, hex, rgb, border-radius, margin, padding, etc.) and requiring perceptual language (heavy, light, cramped, spacious, deliberate, abandoned, etc.) is not a limitation on freedom -- it is a liberation FROM measurement-speak INTO experiential-speak. The auditor is MORE free to describe genuine experience because they cannot fall back on technical descriptions.

5. **Questions are genuinely open-ended.** All 20 questions pass the open-ended test:
   - "What do you notice first?" -- no suggested answer
   - "Where did you speed up? Where did you slow down?" -- no expected pattern
   - "If this page were a piece of music, what would you hear?" -- metaphorical, not analytical
   - "What's the single best moment?" -- no pre-identified target
   - None of the questions contain leading language like "You should notice..." or "The designer intended..."

6. **Section 0 (Cold Look) is experiential-first.** The protocol demands gut reaction BEFORE analysis, locks those reactions permanently, and gives them "permanent priority" over later observations. This is genuine experiential methodology.

7. **No targets or expected outcomes.** Auditors never see PA-05 scores, mechanism counts, gate thresholds, or any indication of what a "good" page looks like. They bring only their own perception.

**Potential concern (minor):**

The PA skill file header (lines 5-9) contains: "Audit-optimized compositions feel mechanical. Tension-derived compositions feel alive. The guardrails are FLOORS (minimum acceptable quality), not TARGETS." This framing is for orchestrators and builders reading the skill, not for auditors. Auditors receive only the prompt template content, not the full PA skill file. Confirmed: the auditor prompt template (SKILL.md lines 424-482 and prompt-templates.md Template 2) does NOT include this header.

**No red flags found in PA auditor isolation.**

---

## 3. WEAVER FREEDOM (Judgment)

### Is the Weaver's judgment genuine?

**VERDICT: YES -- the Weaver makes a genuine creative judgment, not a calculation.**

**Evidence of genuine freedom:**

1. **Receiving principle establishes sovereignty.** The Weaver's 6-point receiving principle (SKILL.md lines 528-537) includes:
   - "View the screenshots yourself first" -- independent perception before reading reports
   - "Your verdict is a creative judgment, not a calculation" -- explicit anti-formula statement
   - "Write creative direction FOR a creator, not corrections FOR a manager" -- output framing as inspiration, not compliance

2. **Convergence rule is appropriate constraint.** "If 3+ auditors converge on the same observation, your synthesis MUST acknowledge it, even if your own impression differs" (SKILL.md line 535). This is a METHODOLOGICAL constraint, not a creative one. It prevents the Weaver from ignoring strong evidence, but the Weaver can still disagree with the auditors' interpretation -- they just must acknowledge the observation. This is intellectual honesty, not coercion.

3. **Creative direction structure is generative.** The AMPLIFY/RELEASE/DEEPEN/GAP framework (SKILL.md lines 576-579) provides creative territories, not fix categories. "These are territories to enter, not instructions to follow" (explicitly stated in the REFINE template, SKILL.md line 787). The Weaver writes creative direction that makes a builder "want to CREATE, not FIX" (SKILL.md line 529).

4. **No numerical targets visible.** The Weaver never sees gate results, PA-05 scores, mechanism counts, or any quantitative quality indicators. The verdict is purely experiential.

5. **Verdict structure is genuinely free.** Three options (SHIP/REFINE/RETHINK) with clear definitions but NO formula for choosing between them. "The verdict is a creative judgment, not a calculation" (repeated in PA skill, line 407). The Weaver reads experience and makes a call.

6. **The Weaver CAN disagree with individual auditors.** The convergence rule requires acknowledging 3+ agreement, but for individual auditor observations, the Weaver can weight, contextualize, or prioritize freely.

**What the Weaver does NOT receive:** gate results, components CSS, mechanism catalog, content markdown, any numerical targets (confirmed in prompt-templates.md line 387).

**No red flags found in Weaver freedom.**

## 4. REFINE FREEDOM (Creative Revision)

### Is the creative revision genuine?

**VERDICT: YES -- the REFINE builder has genuine creative authority with one well-designed guard.**

**Evidence of genuine freedom:**

1. **"Your job is not to fix problems."** The opening line of the REFINE prompt (SKILL.md line 751) is the strongest possible anti-compliance framing. "Your job is to make the page more of what it already is." This frames refinement as creative amplification, not defect correction.

2. **Full creative authority.** "You may restructure HTML, rewrite CSS, change layouts, introduce new mechanisms, and extend the metaphor's expression." (SKILL.md lines 753-754). The REFINE builder can do ANYTHING to the page except replace the metaphor or violate world-description. This is massive creative latitude.

3. **Receives Weaver synthesis, not raw auditor reports.** The REFINE builder gets the Weaver's artistic prose (AMPLIFY/RELEASE/DEEPEN/GAP territories), not individual auditor scores or gate failures. This ensures creative direction arrives as inspiration, not as a fix list.

4. **"These are territories to enter, not instructions to follow."** (SKILL.md line 787). The Weaver's direction is explicitly framed as creative territory, not mandates. "What you do in each territory is yours."

5. **ONE THING commitment.** The REFINE builder states "What is the ONE THING you want to do with this page?" before writing any code (SKILL.md lines 853-856). This prevents scatter-gun fixing and focuses on creative intent.

6. **Different Opus instance.** The REFINE builder is explicitly a DIFFERENT agent from Window 1 (SKILL.md line 953, prompt-templates.md line 522). This defeats continuation bias -- the REFINE builder brings fresh perception, not invested attachment.

7. **Reading order enforces creative sequence.** The prompt is structured: Page first (experience it), then Weaver (creative direction), then previous builder's reflection (creative context), then conviction brief (aspiration), then building materials (tools). This sequence builds creative understanding before providing tools.

8. **"The gap between aspiration and reality is not failure. It is your creative territory."** (SKILL.md line 808). This reframes imperfection as opportunity, not deficiency.

9. **No gate results visible.** The REFINE builder never sees gate results, individual auditor reports, PA-05 scores, or gate failure fix lists (confirmed prompt-templates.md line 525).

**The well-designed guard:**

The REFINE builder cannot replace the metaphor itself or violate the world-description. This is not a freedom limitation -- it is a compositional continuity constraint. Without it, the REFINE builder could throw away all of Window 1's work and start from scratch, which would defeat the two-window architecture. The constraint preserves the CREATIVE FOUNDATION while allowing total freedom within it.

**Can the REFINE builder disagree with the Weaver's direction?**

Yes. "These are territories to enter, not instructions to follow. What you do in each territory is yours." The Weaver provides direction; the REFINE builder has sovereign interpretation. If the Weaver says "AMPLIFY the header's confidence," the REFINE builder can decide that amplification means something different than the Weaver imagined.

**Does the REFINE prompt use "fix" language or "create" language?**

CREATE language throughout:
- "make the page more of what it already is" (not "fix what's wrong")
- "extend the metaphor's expression" (not "correct the metaphor's failures")
- "creative territory" (not "defect list")
- "What is the ONE THING you want to do" (not "address the following issues")
- "make you proud of your contribution" (not "satisfy the requirements")

**No red flags found in REFINE freedom.**

## 5. CONVENTIONS ANALYSIS

### Are the 14-line conventions enabling or constraining?

**VERDICT: ENABLING -- with appropriate mechanical precision.**

The conventions brief (47 lines in conventions-brief.md, 14 lines embedded in prompts) contains exclusively MECHANICAL constraints:

**Physics constraints (define the world):**
- Container: 940-960px -- defines the spine
- Fonts: Inter/Instrument Serif/JetBrains Mono -- defines the voices
- Borders: 1px/3px/4px hierarchy, no 2px -- defines the weight language
- Prohibited CSS: border-radius, box-shadow, gradients, transforms -- defines the geometry

**Perceptibility constraints (prevent invisible work):**
- R >= G >= B on every background hex -- warm palette math
- >= 15 RGB background delta between zones -- prevents imperceptible transitions
- <= 120px stacked gap -- prevents whitespace voids
- <= 96px single margin/padding -- prevents runaway spacing

**Accessibility constraints (non-negotiable baseline):**
- WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
- ARIA landmarks
- 768px responsive breakpoint
- 45-80 characters per line

**Assessment of specific conventions:**

**R >= G >= B -- constraint that enables or limits?**

ENABLES. This is a color-math constraint that guarantees warmth. It does not specify WHICH warm colors -- the builder has the full space of warm hues, neutrals, and near-blacks. The constraint eliminates cold/blue-dominant backgrounds but preserves enormous creative latitude within the warm spectrum. It is a PHYSICS rule (like "gravity pulls down"), not an aesthetic judgment.

**Font trinity -- constraint that enables or limits?**

ENABLES. Three typefaces provide three distinct voices (editorial, functional, technical). The constraint prevents font-sprawl while providing sufficient typographic range for any compositional approach. The builder controls size, weight, spacing, alignment, and deployment -- the trinity constrains instrument selection, not the music.

**No aesthetic judgments encoded.** The conventions do not contain: "headings should feel authoritative," "spacing should feel generous," "borders should create tension." They specify VALUES (940px, 1px, #FEF9F5) not FEELINGS. The feelings are the builder's domain.

**The "absorb these, do not checklist them" meta-instruction** (SKILL.md line 135) explicitly prevents compliance orientation toward the conventions. This is a freedom-supporting instruction.

---

## 6. RED FLAGS FOUND

### Systematic scan for compliance language in creative prompts

**Scanned for:** "must achieve", "ensure compliance", "verify that", "fail if", "must score", "quality bar", mechanism counts, PA-05 references, gate IDs, gate failure language, checklist format, numerical targets beyond conventions.

**Results:**

| # | Phrase | File | Line | Assessment |
|---|--------|------|------|------------|
| 1 | "You must produce 3 files" | SKILL.md | 81 | PLUMBING -- output specification, not quality target. Equivalent to "turn in your assignment." NOT a red flag. |
| 2 | "Do NOT read text" (Cold Look) | SKILL.md | 441 | METHODOLOGICAL -- prevents analytical contamination of first impression. FREEDOM-SUPPORTING. |
| 3 | "they are LOCKED forever" (Cold Look reactions) | SKILL.md | 442 | METHODOLOGICAL -- prevents post-hoc revision of genuine first impression. FREEDOM-SUPPORTING. |
| 4 | "Your answers may NOT contain: px, rem, em..." | SKILL.md | 469-471 | METHODOLOGICAL -- forces perceptual language. This INCREASES freedom of expression by removing measurement crutches. |
| 5 | "your synthesis MUST acknowledge it" (3+ convergence) | SKILL.md | 535 | METHODOLOGICAL -- prevents ignoring strong evidence. Does not constrain interpretation or verdict. |
| 6 | "You may NOT replace the metaphor itself" | SKILL.md | 755 | ARCHITECTURAL -- preserves Window 1's creative foundation. Appropriate constraint for two-window system. |
| 7 | "Follow this sequence exactly" (REFINE reading order) | SKILL.md | 765 | METHODOLOGICAL -- ensures creative materials arrive in the right order. Does not constrain what the builder does with them. |

**ZERO compliance red flags found.** All "must"/"NOT" instances fall into three categories:
- PLUMBING (output file specs)
- METHODOLOGICAL (perceptual protocol enforcement)
- ARCHITECTURAL (two-window integrity)

None are quality targets, score requirements, mechanism counts, or aesthetic judgments encoded as rules.

### Additional check: hidden compliance in TC skill

The TC skill (841 lines) contains process structure that could be read as compliance:
- Phase gates, Addition Test, BECAUSE test, SUBSTITUTION test
- "Step 3.5 -- Evaluate Candidates" with criteria

But these are CREATIVE PROCESS tools (how to derive a metaphor rigorously) not OUTCOME requirements (what the metaphor must be). The TC skill explicitly frames itself as construction, not discovery: "Multiple valid metaphors exist for the SAME content." The process is structured; the output is free.

### Check: do builders see gate thresholds?

**NO.** Gates are entirely invisible to all creative agents:
- Window 1 builder: sees conventions (values), not gates (pass/fail)
- PA auditors: see only screenshots and questions
- Weaver: sees only auditor reports and screenshots
- REFINE builder: sees only Weaver synthesis, reflection, brief, and conventions

The gate runner operates in parallel with PA (Step 3 concurrent with Step 4) and its results feed ONLY the orchestrator's routing decision (Step 6). No creative agent ever sees a gate result.

---

## 7. VERDICT

### FREEDOM IS GENUINE

**Confidence: HIGH (9/10)**

The Pipeline v2 design achieves genuine creative freedom within every window through consistent application of these principles:

1. **Plumbing/freedom separation is clean.** The orchestrator handles file I/O, server management, screenshot capture, gate execution, and routing. Creative agents handle metaphor derivation, page building, perceptual evaluation, synthesis, and creative revision. These domains do not cross-contaminate.

2. **Information isolation is rigorous.** Each window receives exactly what it needs for its creative function and nothing that would contaminate its judgment. PA auditors are context-starved. Builders are target-free. The Weaver is gate-blind.

3. **Conventions are physics, not aesthetics.** The 14-line conventions encode the world's physical laws (container width, font names, color math) not aesthetic preferences (warmth, confidence, rhythm). Builders create within the physics; the physics does not dictate the art.

4. **Language throughout is generative, not compliance-oriented.** "What excites you," "your perception is the tiebreaker," "the metaphor is yours," "these are territories to enter, not instructions to follow," "make the page more of what it already is." Every creative prompt reads as an invitation to create, not a checklist to satisfy.

5. **No hidden compliance.** Zero instances of quality scores, mechanism counts, gate IDs, PA-05 references, or "achieve X" language in any creative prompt.

6. **The TC skill is structured creativity, not constrained creativity.** Its 5-phase process is analogous to sonnet form -- a structure that channels creative energy rather than suppressing it. The builder CHOOSES their metaphor; the process ensures the choice is rigorous.

**The 1/10 deduction:** The conventions themselves (R >= G >= B, 940-960px container, font trinity, no border-radius) define a narrow aesthetic world. A builder who wants to use cool tones, rounded corners, or wide layouts cannot. This is BY DESIGN -- the world is the world -- but it is still a constraint on absolute creative freedom. The question is whether you consider world-physics to be a constraint or a given. Within the fiction of the design system, these are gravity -- not optional. From outside, they are an aesthetic choice that limits the solution space. The deduction acknowledges this philosophical tension without calling it a problem.

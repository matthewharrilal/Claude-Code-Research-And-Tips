| Location | Pattern | Classification | Edit |
|----------|---------|---------------|------|
| #14 hover lift | P3 (soul defended by PA that assumes it) | HIDDEN-BIAS | Added note: "editorial identity" assessed by PA-19/20/25 which embed this system's definition of editorial |
| #21/#22 evidence claims | P5 (mechanism count proxy), P6 (auditor agreement as truth) | NEEDS-ENRICHMENT | Added: 9/9 agreement proves PA detects voids, not that voids are universally bad; "visual interest" measured by system-shaped PA-52/35 |
| Implications section | P1 (PA-05 validates soul), P3, P5 | HIDDEN-BIAS | Added: even "evidence-based" 8 need re-examination — only ~4 survive instrument-independent validation |
| N-3 codification pattern | P3 (soul defended by PA) | CONTRADICTION | Added step 5 to the 4-step cycle: PA confirms constraint → but PA assumes the constraint's aesthetic → system confirms own definition |

| Location | Pattern | Classification | Edit |
|----------|---------|---------------|------|
| Key Evidence table | P1 (PA-05 as evidence) | NEEDS-ENRICHMENT | Added note: several claims use PA-05 scores as implicit evidence; PA-05 designed by same system |
| "The root" paragraph | P7 (perceptual physics) | HIDDEN-BIAS | Added: PA "validation" is self-referential; independent validation requires external instrument |
| Arbitrariness section | P3 (soul defended by PA) | CONTRADICTION | Added: PA evaluations "validate" rules but PA questions were designed to measure conformance to THIS aesthetic |
| Enforcement-vs-creativity | P4 (warm palette as physics) | HIDDEN-BIAS | Added: "warm tones feel editorial" is system association, not perceptual science; counterexamples cited |

## File: 11-MASTER-SESSION-DOCUMENT.md (4 edits)

| Location | Pattern | Classification | Edit |
|----------|---------|---------------|------|
| N-8 (PA as distinct paradigm) | P1, P3 (PA independence assumed) | SILENT-ABSORPTION | Added: PA and gates share aesthetic DNA; 39% neutral vs 61% aesthetic-shaped; independence is partial |
| Q5 (Visual Outcome) | P1, P2 | NEEDS-ENRICHMENT | Added Q5.5: PA-05 cannot be sole instrument for quality deltas; must separate neutral from aesthetic findings |
| N-3 (Objectivity Trap) | P2 (DESIGNED as objective) | HIDDEN-BIAS | Added: PA-05's DESIGNED scale adds quantitative veneer to self-referential aesthetic judgment |
| Q3.5/Q3.6 | P1 (PA-05 as evidence) | NEEDS-ENRICHMENT | Added circularity notes: "protective by what standard?" and "worse as measured by which instrument?" |

## File: 15-BRIEF.md (5 edits)

| Location | Pattern | Classification | Edit |
|----------|---------|---------------|------|
| Visual map caption | P1, P2 | NEEDS-ENRICHMENT | Added: "highest-quality" measured by PA-05 which embeds system aesthetics; REFINE superiority is real but measurement-framework-dependent |
| Verdict table (REFINE + PA rows) | P1, P3 | HIDDEN-BIAS | REFINE: flagged PA-05 dependency. PA protocol: reclassified as SELF-REFERENTIAL — instrument validating itself |
| Finding #2 (soul contradictions) | P3 | NEEDS-ENRICHMENT | Added: "8 evidence-based" partly relies on PA data; ~4 survive independent validation |
| Finding #3 (REFINE best) | P2 | HIDDEN-BIAS | Added: "works" means PA-05 scores higher; artistic prose may align better with PA's aesthetic vocabulary |
| Q1 + Q3 (open questions) | P1, P8 | NEEDS-ENRICHMENT | Added: experiments using PA-05 need independent measurement; should score neutral-only questions separately |

## Summary

- **17 edits** across 4 files
- **All 8 patterns** found at least once
- **Most common:** P1 (PA-05 as evidence, 7 instances), P3 (soul defended by assuming PA, 5 instances)
- **Deepest bias:** BRIEF.md classified PA auditor protocol as "PROTECTIVE" — this is the instrument validating itself (P3+P6)
- **Key structural finding:** The "evidence-based" classification of soul constraints is partially circular; ~4 of 8 survive instrument-independent validation
- **No pattern found for:** P8 (emotional arc) was less prevalent in these 4 files (appears more in build-specific reports)

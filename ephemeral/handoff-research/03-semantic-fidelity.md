# Semantic Fidelity Across Handoff Boundaries

## The Trace Subject: "Geological Strata" for a Research Synthesis Page

This report traces the semantic content of a hypothetical metaphor -- "Geological
Strata" -- through every handoff boundary in the /build-page pipeline. At each
boundary, we identify what meaning survives, what transforms, and what dies.

The content is a research synthesis page: multiple findings layered by confidence,
with deep analytical sections and lighter overview sections. The TC analyst derives
"Geological Strata" because the content has literal confidence LAYERS, findings
that COMPRESS under evidentiary weight, and a bedrock of core conclusions beneath
sedimentary supporting evidence.

---

## Boundary 1: Content --> Multi-Axis Questioning (Phase 1)

### What enters
Raw markdown. The content IS the meaning. Every word, every heading, every
structural choice by the author carries semantic intent. The research synthesis
has: 12 findings organized by confidence tier, causal chains between findings,
a methodology section that establishes evidentiary standards, and a conclusion
that synthesizes across tiers.

### What the TC agent produces
A table of axis-keyed needs:

```
AXIS: FEEL
Needs: graduated trust, stability beneath complexity, confidence that deepens
Structural Properties: layering, ordering by depth, compression gradient
Richness: HIGH

AXIS: UNDERSTAND
Needs: evidentiary weight visible in hierarchy, causal chains traceable
Structural Properties: containment, hierarchy, directional flow
Richness: HIGH
```

### Semantic content at this boundary
The BECAUSE test anchors each need to specific content features:
"The reader needs graduated trust BECAUSE findings are ranked by confidence tier."
"The reader needs compression BECAUSE high-confidence findings rest on denser evidence."

This is the pipeline's STRONGEST semantic moment. The TC analyst is reading the
content deeply, asking WHY this content needs THIS treatment. The BECAUSE test
forces content-specific justification -- not "readers generally need trust" but
"THIS reader needs graduated trust BECAUSE THIS content has confidence tiers."

### Semantic loss: MINIMAL
The axis questioning preserves the RELATIONSHIP between content structure and
reader need. What is lost: the content's own voice, its prose rhythm, its
specific examples. These are authorial qualities that do not survive any
analytical process. This is acceptable compression.

### Semantic addition: CONSTRUCTIVE
The TC analyst adds a LENS -- the decision to read through FEEL and UNDERSTAND
rather than through DO or NAVIGATE. This is meaning-creation, not meaning-loss.
The skill correctly labels this as "constructing a composition, not discovering
one" (SKILL.md line 8). The semantic content is now content + interpretation.

---

## Boundary 2: Tensions --> Metaphor Candidates (Phase 2-3)

### What enters
Axis-keyed needs with BECAUSE justifications, structural property lists,
richness scores. The dominant tension: "The reader needs graduated warmth
and safety (FEEL) from a system that is angular, austere, and verdict-driven
(KortAI personality: 75% austere, 95% angular, 80% rigid)."

### What happens: the structural extraction
Phase 3 transforms emotional needs into geometric abstractions:
- "Graduated trust" --> ORDERING (sequence with rank)
- "Compression under evidence" --> STRATIFICATION (parallel layers of different density)
- "Stability beneath complexity" --> CONTAINMENT (bounded zones with increasing weight)

Then the system side:
- `border-radius: 0` --> ANGULARITY
- `box-shadow: none` --> FLATNESS
- 3-tier borders --> DISCRETE WEIGHT

The search query becomes: "What is naturally LAYERED, ORDERED, CONTAINED,
while being ANGULAR and FLAT, yet conveying GRADUATED TRUST and STABILITY?"

Answer: Geological strata.

### Semantic content at this boundary

**What survives:** The structural isomorphism table maps metaphor properties
to both content properties AND system mechanisms. "Sedimentary layers" maps
to "confidence tiers" maps to "background-color zones with >=15 RGB delta."
This is a three-way bridge: content meaning <-> physical metaphor <-> CSS
property. The isomorphism IS the semantic content.

**What transforms:** The emotional poles of the tension (warmth vs. austerity)
become physical properties of the metaphor (surface warmth vs. bedrock density).
The tension is not RESOLVED -- it is REFRAMED. "Warmth" is no longer an emotion
the page needs to convey; it is a physical property of the surface stratum
(lighter colors, more spacing, gentler typography). "Austerity" is not the
system's personality; it is the character of bedrock (dense, heavy, angular).

This transformation is the pipeline's core creative act. The semantic content
changes KIND: from emotional-relational to physical-spatial. The question is
whether this change PRESERVES meaning or REPLACES it.

### The semantic cliff begins here

The BECAUSE test result enters the metaphor scoring. The TC brief will carry:
"This metaphor works BECAUSE confidence tiers map to geological strata -- higher
confidence = deeper stratum = denser CSS." This is a one-sentence compression
of the entire Phase 1-2 derivation. The multi-axis questioning, the tension
dimensions, the richness formula, the rejected candidates -- all compressed
to one BECAUSE sentence.

**Semantic loss: MODERATE.** The BECAUSE sentence preserves the structural
relationship but loses the DISCOVERY PROCESS. The builder will never know
that RECONCILE was considered and rejected, that the cylindrical-shape
risk was flagged, that the perceptual cost assessment scored 2/5 on compression
floor risk. These process artifacts carry semantic weight -- they explain
not just WHAT was chosen but WHY alternatives were rejected. The brief format
(80-120 lines) cannot carry this.

---

## Boundary 3: Metaphor --> TC Brief (Phase 4.5)

### What enters
A committed metaphor with full scoring: 6-criterion rubric (e.g., Interpretive
Distance 2/3, Content-Shape Fit 3/3, Structural Survival 2/3, etc.), the
isomorphism table (6+ mappings), the zone architecture (4 zones: Surface
Orientation, Sedimentary Context, Deep Analysis, Bedrock Synthesis), the
selected mechanisms (16 across all 5 categories), and the transition plan.

### The TC brief format: 8 sections in 80-120 lines

Here is where we can trace EXACTLY what semantic content survives into each
section:

**Section 1: STRUCTURAL METAPHOR (~10 lines)**
Survives: metaphor name, WHY it is structural, 3-5 CSS directions, the
BECAUSE test result. This is the semantic core. "Geological strata -> visible
layer boundaries via border-left-width progression, density gradient via
tightening line-height, stratification via background color shifts of >=15
RGB per zone."

What dies: the SEARCH PROCESS. The three heuristics (constraint scan, content
resonance, emotional valence) that led to geological strata are not in the
brief. The rejected candidates (Archival Vault, Laboratory Stratification)
are gone. The builder receives the WINNER without knowing the COMPETITION.

**Section 2: ZONE ARCHITECTURE (~15 lines)**
Survives: zone count (4), zone names (Surface Orientation / Sedimentary Context
/ Deep Analysis / Bedrock Synthesis), semantic direction at each boundary
(OPENING -> DEEPENING -> DEEPENING -> RESOLVING), density levels, content mapping.

What transforms: zone names carry metaphor vocabulary. "Sedimentary Context"
is a LABEL that encodes both the metaphor (geological) and the content role
(supporting evidence). This label is the primary semantic vehicle from TC to
builder -- the builder's first encounter with the metaphor is through these
zone names.

What dies: WHY these zones, not others. The content has 12 findings across
confidence tiers. The decision to group them into 4 zones (not 3 or 5)
reflects a compositional judgment about arc shape that is not documented
in the brief. The builder inherits the RESULT but not the REASONING.

**Section 3: CONTENT TENSIONS (~10 lines)**
Survives: the 3-5 key tensions, their axes, the dominant tension. "FEEL axis:
graduated trust vs. angular austerity. Dominant."

What dies: the richness scores (Opposition Depth x Structural Overlap x
Metaphor Space Width = 18). The SUBSTITUTION test results. The compound
tension analysis. The builder sees the POLES but not the RICHNESS that made
these poles worth bridging.

**Section 4: SELECTED MECHANISMS (~20 lines)**
Survives: mechanism names with catalog categories, 1-line CSS recipes, how
each serves the metaphor. "Deploy #7 Zone Backgrounds: background shifts
from #FEF9F5 (surface) to #F0EBE3 (sedimentary) to #FFFFFF (deep analysis)
to #1A1A1A (bedrock). Stratification made visible."

What transforms: mechanisms are now CSS RECIPES. "Border-weight gradient
encoding" becomes "border-left: 4px solid at bedrock, 3px at deep analysis,
1px at surface." The semantic content (heavier borders = deeper = more
confident) is encoded in the VALUE PROGRESSION, not in explicit text. The
builder must INFER the semantic direction from the CSS values.

What dies: the justification for each mechanism. The TC brief format allows
1 line per mechanism for how it serves the metaphor. "Stratification made
visible" is a compressed pointer, not an explanation. The full reasoning --
why zone backgrounds (not border-weight alone) carry the primary depth signal,
why the dark slab inversion at bedrock creates the maximum contrast event --
is truncated.

**Section 5: METAPHOR-IMPLIED CSS DIRECTIONS (~15 lines)**
Survives: per-scale CSS directions (page, section, component, character).

This section is structurally redundant with Section 4 but framed at SCALES
rather than MECHANISMS. It tells the builder: "At page scale, the container
darkens top-to-bottom. At component scale, components in deep zones have
tighter internal padding."

What transforms: scale-based framing converts mechanism-specific knowledge
into architectural guidance. The builder is now thinking in ZOOM LEVELS,
not individual CSS properties.

**Section 6: BUILD RECIPE (~25 lines)**
Survives: zone-keyed deployment sequence with specific CSS values, action
verbs (Set, Deploy, Assess), perception checks.

```
ZONE: Sedimentary Context
  1. Set zone background: #F0EBE3 (delta from Surface: 18 RGB -- >=15? YES)
  2. Deploy #4 Spacing Compression: padding: 48px (vs Surface 64px)
  3. Deploy #1 Border-Weight: border-left: 3px solid var(--color-border)
  PERCEPTION CHECK: >=3 channels shift at boundary? YES (bg + spacing + border)
```

This is the semantic LANDING ZONE. Everything the builder needs is here --
specific CSS values, perception thresholds, zone boundaries. But the recipe
is OPERATIONAL, not EXPLANATORY. It tells the builder WHAT to build, not
WHY each value was chosen. The semantic content has been converted from
REASONING to INSTRUCTION.

**Section 7: DETECTION EXPECTATIONS (~10 lines)**
Goes to weaver, not builder. Semantic content: what PA auditors should SEE
per mechanism. "Squint test: the surface-to-sedimentary boundary should be
visible as a background tone shift."

**Section 8: BUILDER ANCHORS (~5 lines)**
3 non-negotiable page-specific guardrails. "The geological descent arc must
be visible in background darkening from Zone 1 to Zone 4."

### The brief as semantic vehicle: assessment

The brief carries STRUCTURAL meaning faithfully. The isomorphism table
(content property <-> metaphor property <-> CSS mechanism) survives in
distributed form across sections 1, 4, 5, and 6.

The brief LOSES three categories of meaning:
1. **Process meaning** -- why this metaphor, not others
2. **Tension richness** -- why these poles generate productive composition
3. **Mechanism justification depth** -- why THIS mechanism at THIS location

These losses are inherent to the 80-120 line format. The brief is designed
as a DESIGN BRIEF, not a design ESSAY. The format choice prioritizes builder
actionability over semantic completeness.

---

## Boundary 4: TC Brief --> Builder's Conviction Statement

### What enters
The builder reads: TC brief (80-120 lines), conventions brief (440 lines),
content markdown.

### What the builder produces
A conviction statement:

```
CONVICTION STATEMENT
Content: research-synthesis.md
Zones: 4 (Surface, Sedimentary, Deep Analysis, Bedrock)
Organizing principle: Geological descent -- confidence deepens like strata
Coherence direction: DEEPENING
Metaphor: Geological Strata -- layered evidence compressed under evidentiary weight
```

### Semantic evaluation: anchor or compliance artifact?

**As semantic anchor:** The conviction statement distills the TC brief into
5 fields. "Geological descent -- confidence deepens like strata" is a
one-sentence compression of Sections 1-3 of the TC brief. If the builder
UNDERSTANDS this sentence -- if "confidence deepens like strata" evokes
specific CSS decisions (darker backgrounds, tighter spacing, heavier borders
as you scroll down) -- then the conviction statement serves as a semantic
anchor.

**As compliance artifact:** The conviction statement is a TEMPLATE with blanks.
The builder fills in zone names from Section 2, coherence direction from
Section 2, metaphor name from Section 1. No creative transformation occurs.
A builder could produce a correct conviction statement without understanding
the metaphor's semantic content.

**The test:** Does the builder's CSS reveal semantic understanding or template
compliance?

Evidence for SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING: The builder varies component internal
padding by zone (tighter in bedrock, airier at surface), uses parametric echo
(same callout type appears denser in deep zones), and places the dramatic
moment at 70% scroll depth (bedrock synthesis). These decisions require
UNDERSTANDING "geological descent" as a governing principle, not just
following the recipe's specific values.

Evidence for TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE: The builder follows the recipe exactly --
backgrounds match specified hex values, border weights match specified px
values, padding matches specified values -- but components in bedrock zones
have the same internal padding as surface zones. Parametric echo is absent.
The metaphor exists in ZONE-LEVEL CSS but not in COMPONENT-LEVEL adaptation.
The builder followed instructions without internalizing the organizing principle.

**The conventions brief's role:** The conventions brief (Section 5: Fractal
Echo, Section 6: Unified Metaphor) tells the builder to express the metaphor
at all 5 scales. This is a STRUCTURAL instruction about scale coverage, not
a semantic instruction about what "geological descent" means at component
scale. The builder knows they SHOULD vary components by zone but may not know
HOW the geological metaphor should shape that variation.

### Semantic loss at this boundary: VARIABLE

An Opus builder with strong compositional instinct will read "Geological Strata"
and make the inference: "Deeper strata = compressed material = denser components
= tighter internal padding = heavier internal borders." This inference is not
explicitly stated in the TC brief but follows from the metaphor's physical logic.

A literal builder will read the recipe values and implement them without the
governing inference. The CSS will be correct at zone boundaries (where the
recipe specifies exact values) and FLAT within zones (where the recipe does
not specify component-internal variation).

This is why the MEMORY.md records that "Opus ALWAYS for builders" is non-
negotiable. The semantic gap between recipe and intent is bridged by the
builder's ability to REASON FROM METAPHOR, not just FOLLOW INSTRUCTION.

---

## Boundary 5: Built Page --> Programmatic Gates (Step 4)

### What enters
output.html -- 1000+ lines of CSS and HTML.

### What the gates measure
16 composition-critical gates. Every gate is STRUCTURAL, not SEMANTIC.

| Gate | What it measures | Semantic content |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| SC-01 | Container width 940-960px | ZERO -- width has no metaphor meaning |
| SC-09 | Background delta >= 15 RGB | STRUCTURAL -- "zones exist" but not "why" |
| SC-13 | >= 3 channels shift at boundaries | STRUCTURAL -- "coherence present" |
| SC-14 | No sub-perceptual CSS | ZERO -- catches waste, not meaning |

**Semantic content of gates: ZERO.**

The gates verify that the CSS STRUCTURE exists. They cannot verify that the
structure MEANS anything. SC-09 confirms that Zone 2's background differs
from Zone 1's by >= 15 RGB. It cannot confirm that the shift encodes
"sedimentary context is denser than surface orientation." SC-13 confirms
that 3+ channels shift at a boundary. It cannot confirm that all channels
encode the SAME semantic direction (DEEPENING).

### Why this is acceptable

Gates are STRUCTURAL FLOORS, not semantic validators. Their purpose is to
prevent the builder from producing imperceptible CSS (the Flagship failure
mode: backgrounds differing by 1-8 RGB). They catch the bottom, not the top.

### What is lost at this boundary

Nothing is LOST -- the gates add information (PASS/FAIL per gate with measured
values). But the semantic content of the composition -- what the metaphor
MEANS, why zones are organized THIS way -- is INVISIBLE to the gates.

This creates a measurable gap: a page can PASS all 16 gates while having
zero semantic coherence. Backgrounds can shift >= 15 RGB in RANDOM directions
(sometimes lighter, sometimes darker) and pass SC-09. Channels can shift
in CONTRADICTORY directions (background darkens but spacing loosens) and pass
SC-13 (which counts shifts, not direction). The conventions brief warns
against this ("If the background darkens but spacing increases, the channels
contradict"), but the gates cannot enforce it.

---

## Boundary 6: Screenshots --> PA Auditors (Step 6)

### What enters
PNG screenshots at 1440px, 1024px, 768px. Cold look + scroll-through.
Zero build context. Zero TC brief. Zero metaphor knowledge.

### What PA auditors evaluate

**PA-44 (Implicit vs. explicit metaphor):**
"If you removed all labels, headings, and text annotations, could you still
sense the metaphor from the visual structure alone?"

This question asks auditors to detect the metaphor WITHOUT KNOWING what it is.
The auditor sees: backgrounds darkening as they scroll, spacing tightening,
borders getting heavier, typography densifying. They might describe this as
"progressive compression" or "descent into density." They will not say
"geological strata" unless the builder used metaphor vocabulary in visible text.

**Semantic content that PA-44 can detect:**
- STRUCTURAL metaphor: spatial organization visible in CSS alone (YES/NO)
- ATMOSPHERIC metaphor: palette/typography conveys mood (YES/NO)
- LABELED metaphor: text explains what you should see (YES/NO)
- ANNOUNCED metaphor: section titles name the metaphor (YES/NO)

What PA-44 CANNOT detect: whether the auditor's interpretation MATCHES the TC
analyst's intent. The auditor might perceive "progressive compression" and call
it structural -- a valid detection. But if the TC analyst intended "geological
strata" with specific stratigraphic properties (surface weathering, sedimentary
layering, metamorphic compression, igneous bedrock), and the builder only
implemented "things get darker and tighter," the auditor will perceive a
SIMPLER metaphor than was intended.

**PA-68 (Metaphor spatial coverage):**
"Does the page's organizing metaphor persist across ALL scroll thirds?"

This asks about PERSISTENCE, not IDENTITY. The auditor can detect that the
organizing principle CONTINUES without knowing what it IS. This is a valid
perceptual test -- structural metaphors should be visible throughout. But it
measures COVERAGE, not FIDELITY. A page where "things get darker" persists
across all thirds will pass PA-68, even if the richer semantic content
("stratigraphic compression with specific CSS channels encoding specific
geological properties") is absent.

### The fresh-eyes paradox

The PA skill REQUIRES auditors to be "context-starved" (SKILL.md line 48):
"Do NOT provide: mechanism counts, pattern names, build plan details."

This is correct for perceptual validity -- a builder-informed auditor sees
what they expect, not what exists. But it creates a semantic blind spot:
the auditor literally CANNOT evaluate whether the metaphor's SEMANTIC INTENT
survived. They can only evaluate whether SOME organizing principle is
perceptible.

The perceptual-auditing skill addresses this partially through the
Metaphor-Awareness Principles (lines 224-285), which describe how metaphors
encode spatial biases as CSS values. But these principles are for the WEAVER's
classification work, not the auditor's perception. The auditor describes
what they SEE; the weaver interprets what it MEANS.

### Semantic loss at this boundary: SIGNIFICANT

The handoff from built page to PA auditors is the pipeline's most severe
semantic discontinuity. The auditors are DESIGNED to lack semantic context.
What they produce is PERCEPTUAL DESCRIPTION, not semantic evaluation.

This is the correct design for catching perceptual failures (the Flagship's
imperceptible CSS, whitespace voids, monotone typography). But it means that
semantic fidelity -- whether "geological strata" survived as a governing
principle or degraded to "things get darker" -- is UNMEASURED.

---

## Boundary 7: 9 Auditor Reports --> Weaver Synthesis

### What enters
9 perceptual reports in auditor language. "The background shifts from warm
cream to cooler gray as I scroll. Spacing tightens in the lower sections.
Borders get heavier." No CSS values, no metaphor names.

### What the weaver produces

The weaver reads all 9 reports + gate results + lock sheet. The weaver CAN
see the TC brief's detection expectations (Section 7). But the weaver's
primary job is to SYNTHESIZE perceptual findings, not to VALIDATE semantic
intent.

**PA-44/PA-68 failure diagnosis:**

If PA-44 fails ("metaphor not detectable without labels"), the weaver must
diagnose root cause:
- IMPLEMENTATION failure: builder announced instead of embodied
- STRUCTURAL failure: TC derivation produced an unexpressible metaphor
- COVERAGE failure: metaphor present early, abandoned later

This diagnosis is the weaver's MOST SEMANTICALLY LOADED task. To classify
a failure as STRUCTURAL vs. IMPLEMENTATION, the weaver must understand what
the metaphor was TRYING to do (from detection expectations) and what it
ACTUALLY did (from auditor reports). This requires bridging between:
- The TC analyst's INTENT (geological strata with specific isomorphisms)
- The builder's EXECUTION (CSS values that may or may not embody those isomorphisms)
- The auditors' PERCEPTION (visual descriptions without semantic labels)

### The weaver's semantic capability

The weaver has the MOST semantic context of any post-build agent. It sees:
- Gate results (structural measurements)
- Lock sheet (what is LOCKED vs. CHALLENGEABLE)
- Detection expectations (what SHOULD be visible)
- 9 auditor reports (what IS visible)

But the weaver's INSTRUCTIONS are oriented toward VERDICT, not semantic
analysis. The 6-section synthesis format asks for PA-05 score, Tier 5 score,
Top-5 issues, per-question matrix, compositional criteria, and verdict.
None of these sections asks: "Did the metaphor's semantic intent survive
into the built CSS?"

The closest the weaver gets is the Metaphor Expression Spectrum:
| Level | Expression | Quality |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| STRUCTURAL | Spatial organization, color progression, visual weight | HIGHEST |
| ATMOSPHERIC | Palette, typography, vocabulary choices | HIGH |
| LABELED | Explicit text labels on structural elements | MEDIUM |
| ANNOUNCED | Section titles explain the metaphor | LOW |

This spectrum measures HOW the metaphor is expressed but not WHETHER its
SPECIFIC MEANING survived. A page could express "some progressive principle"
at the STRUCTURAL level and score highly, even if the specific geological
semantics (surface weathering, sedimentary compression, metamorphic density,
igneous bedrock) are absent.

### Semantic loss at this boundary: MODERATE

The weaver CAN diagnose metaphor failure modes. It CANNOT evaluate semantic
fidelity beyond the structural/atmospheric/labeled/announced spectrum. The
distinction between "geological strata expressed structurally" and "generic
progressive darkening expressed structurally" is invisible to the weaver.

---

## Boundary 8: Weaver Instructions --> Fix Cycle

### What enters
Top-5 issues with fix classification: MECHANICAL, STRUCTURAL, or COMPOSITIONAL.

Example fix instruction:
```
STRUCTURAL fix: PA-68 FAIL at bottom third.
Builder: re-read TC brief Sections 2+4 to recover compositional intent.
Zone 4 (Bedrock Synthesis) currently flat -- no boundary shift from Zone 3.
Direction: add background shift + border-weight increase at Z3->Z4 boundary.
```

### Does re-reading restore semantic understanding?

**If the builder originally UNDERSTOOD the metaphor:** Re-reading Sections 2+4
triggers memory of the original compositional intent. "Right -- bedrock should
be the DENSEST zone, with maximum contrast and heaviest borders. I forgot to
differentiate Z3 and Z4." The fix will be semantically coherent because the
builder is recovering understanding they already had.

**If the builder originally FOLLOWED THE RECIPE:** Re-reading Sections 2+4
provides the SAME information that was insufficient the first time. The builder
sees the zone architecture and mechanism list. They see that Zone 4 should
differ from Zone 3. They add a background shift and a heavier border. But
without understanding WHY bedrock is the culmination of the geological descent
-- that it represents the highest-confidence findings compressed under the
full weight of evidence -- the fix may be technically correct but semantically
hollow. The background may shift in the wrong direction (lighter instead of
darker), or the border may be placed inconsistently with the stratigraphic
metaphor.

### The fix cycle as semantic degradation engine

Each fix cycle compresses the semantic signal further. The original chain:

```
Content (10,000 words of meaning)
  --> TC analysis (2,000 words of interpretation)
    --> TC brief (100 lines of instruction)
      --> Builder's CSS (1,000 lines of implementation)
        --> PA perception (500 words of description)
          --> Weaver diagnosis (50 words of fix instruction)
            --> Builder re-read (100 lines of original brief)
```

By the fix cycle, the semantic content has been compressed through 6 boundaries.
The fix instruction says "add background shift + border-weight increase at
Z3->Z4 boundary." This is a CSS INSTRUCTION with zero metaphor content. The
builder is told WHAT to change but not HOW the change serves the geological
metaphor.

The instruction to "re-read Sections 2+4" is a SEMANTIC RECOVERY mechanism --
it attempts to re-inject meaning into a process that has been operating at
the structural level. Whether this works depends entirely on the builder's
ability to re-derive semantic intent from the brief text.

---

## The Biggest Semantic Cliff

**Boundary 3 --> Boundary 4: TC Brief --> Builder Implementation.**

This is where semantic meaning drops most sharply. The TC brief compresses
the entire Phase 1-3 derivation (potentially 2,000+ words of analysis) into
80-120 lines. The builder receives INSTRUCTIONS but not UNDERSTANDING.

The specific cliff is between Section 1's BECAUSE test ("This metaphor works
BECAUSE confidence tiers map to geological strata") and Section 6's BUILD
RECIPE ("Set zone background: #F0EBE3, delta 18 RGB"). The BECAUSE sentence
carries semantic meaning. The recipe line carries CSS values. The bridge
between them -- WHY #F0EBE3 (and not #F5F0E8), WHY 18 RGB delta (and not 25),
WHY this specific shade at this specific zone -- exists in the TC analyst's
mind but not in the brief.

The conventions brief HELPS by providing the PHYSICS of multi-coherence ("all
channels encode the same semantic direction"). But it provides GENERIC physics,
not metaphor-specific guidance. It tells the builder that channels should agree,
not that geological descent specifically means "darker + denser + heavier +
tighter" simultaneously.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Semantic loss is inherent but amplifiable

The 80-120 line brief format guarantees semantic compression. The TC analyst's
Phase 1-3 process produces 2,000+ words of reasoning that must compress to
100 lines. This is a 20:1 compression ratio on the semantic content.

However, the brief format COULD preserve more meaning with two additions:
- **A "metaphor physics" paragraph** (5-10 lines) explaining what the metaphor's
  physical properties MEAN in CSS terms: "In geological strata, depth =
  compression. CSS translation: every zone boundary should simultaneously
  darken backgrounds, tighten spacing, increase border weight, and densify
  typography. If any channel moves AGAINST depth, the geological metaphor
  is broken."
- **Rejected alternatives** (3-5 lines) listing what was considered and why it
  lost. This gives the builder NEGATIVE constraints: "NOT Archival Vault
  (uniform drawers = monotony risk). NOT Laboratory Stratification
  (label-dependent communication)."

### 2. The conviction statement is a compliance artifact that CAN become a semantic anchor

The conviction statement's current template (`Organizing principle: [one sentence]`)
produces a one-sentence compression that may or may not carry semantic weight.
"Geological descent -- confidence deepens like strata" is a good sentence
that evokes physical properties. "Geological theme for research content" is a
bad sentence that evokes nothing.

The difference is whether the builder writes a PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION (what the
metaphor DOES in space) or a TOPICAL LABEL (what domain the metaphor comes from).
The conventions brief's conviction card template does not enforce this distinction.

**Improvement:** Add a sub-field: "What CSS direction does this metaphor demand?
[one word: DEEPENING/OPENING/FOCUSING/RESOLVING]" plus "What happens at EVERY
boundary in this direction? [one sentence describing simultaneous channel shifts]."
This forces the builder to articulate the metaphor's CSS physics before writing
any code.

### 3. The BECAUSE test preserves semantic intent but dies at the brief boundary

The BECAUSE test is the pipeline's most effective semantic preservation mechanism.
"The reader needs X BECAUSE [specific content property]" forces the TC analyst
to ground each need in content reality. But the BECAUSE result appears ONCE in
the TC brief (Section 1) and is never referenced again.

The builder reads it, moves to the recipe, and builds from CSS values. By Zone 3,
the BECAUSE sentence is below the attention horizon. The conventions brief's
"midpoint reflection" habit asks "what feels designed? what feels flat?" but does
not ask "does my CSS still embody the BECAUSE relationship?"

**Improvement:** Embed a BECAUSE echo in each zone's recipe block: "ZONE:
Sedimentary Context. BECAUSE: supporting evidence is the content's middle
stratum -- less certain than bedrock, more grounded than surface. CSS
EXPRESSION: moderate density, transitional tone." This costs 2 lines per zone
(8-10 lines total) and keeps the semantic thread alive throughout the build.

### 4. PA auditors measure perceptual survival, not semantic fidelity

PA-44 and PA-68 can detect that SOME organizing principle exists in the CSS.
They cannot detect whether it matches the TC analyst's INTENT. This is by
design -- fresh-eyes auditors must not be primed with expectations. But it
means semantic fidelity is UNMEASURED in the pipeline.

The gap: a page where "geological strata" degraded to "generic progressive
darkening" will score identically on PA-44 and PA-68 as a page where the
full stratigraphic metaphor survived. Both have a detectable organizing
principle. Both persist across scroll thirds. The perceptual audit cannot
distinguish RICH metaphor expression from THIN metaphor expression.

The Tier 5 questions come closest to semantic evaluation:
- PA-63 (Fractal Zoom Coherence) detects whether the principle appears at
  multiple scales
- PA-65 (Music Analogy) detects ensemble vs. unison
- PA-67 (Novelty Beyond Competence) detects creative surprise

But even these measure COMPOSITIONAL PROPERTIES, not METAPHOR FIDELITY.

### 5. The fix cycle degrades semantics by design

Fix instructions are STRUCTURAL ("add background shift at Z3->Z4") or
MECHANICAL ("increase border-width to 3px"). The weaver classifies fixes
by type (MECHANICAL/STRUCTURAL/COMPOSITIONAL) but provides STRUCTURAL
instructions even for compositional problems.

The instruction "re-read TC brief Sections 2+4" is the only semantic
recovery mechanism. Its effectiveness depends on the builder's inference
ability -- whether re-reading the zone architecture and mechanism list
triggers the same physical understanding that the TC analyst had.

TYPE C fixes (full TC re-invocation) are the only fix type that restores
full semantic content. But they are reserved for catastrophic metaphor
failure and reset the entire build. The pipeline has no mechanism for
INCREMENTAL semantic recovery -- small semantic drifts accumulate without
correction because they are below the fix-type classification threshold.

## Semantic Fidelity Score by Boundary

| Boundary | Semantic Fidelity | Primary Loss | Recoverable? |
|----------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Content --> Phase 1 | 95% | Author's voice, prose rhythm | No (acceptable) |
| Phase 1-2 --> Phase 3 | 80% | Alternative candidates, process reasoning | Partially (in TC analyst's log) |
| Phase 3 --> TC Brief | 55% | Tension richness, mechanism justification depth | No (format constraint) |
| TC Brief --> Builder CSS | 35% | WHY each value, metaphor physics | Partially (if builder infers) |
| Builder CSS --> Gates | 35% (unchanged) | Gates add nothing, lose nothing | N/A |
| Builder CSS --> PA auditors | 20% | Metaphor identity, semantic intent | No (by design) |
| PA reports --> Weaver | 15% | Metaphor-specific evaluation | Partially (detection expectations) |
| Fix instructions --> Builder | 10-35% | Depends on re-read effectiveness | Partially (TYPE B) or fully (TYPE C) |

The pipeline's semantic content drops from ~95% to ~15% across 7 boundaries.
The steepest drop is at the TC Brief --> Builder boundary (55% to 35%) and
the Builder --> PA boundary (35% to 20%).

## Is Semantic Loss the Right Frame?

A counter-argument: the pipeline is not a semantic TRANSMISSION system. It is a
TRANSFORMATION system. The TC analyst's semantic understanding of "geological
strata" is transformed into CSS STRUCTURE by the builder. The structure is then
evaluated PERCEPTUALLY by auditors. At each stage, the FORM of meaning changes
while the FUNCTION persists.

Under this frame, the question is not "does the builder know why #F0EBE3?" but
"does the reader FEEL geological descent?" If the reader perceives progressive
compression, darkening, and densification -- if they FEEL they are going deeper
-- then the metaphor succeeded even if the builder and auditors never used the
word "geological."

The pipeline's design reflects this philosophy: meaning should ARRIVE in the
reader's perception, not survive in the builder's documentation. The PA audit
measures the RIGHT thing (perceptual arrival) even though it cannot measure
the thing we wish it could (semantic fidelity to TC intent).

The risk: when perceptual arrival is measured but semantic fidelity is not,
the pipeline cannot distinguish between:
- A page where "geological strata" produced a rich, specific, content-driven
  composition (high semantic fidelity, high perceptual quality)
- A page where "generic progressive darkening" produced a competent,
  non-specific, pattern-matched composition (low semantic fidelity, adequate
  perceptual quality)

Both pass PA-44. Both pass PA-68. The difference is felt but unmeasured.
That unmeasured gap is the semantic fidelity cost of the current pipeline.

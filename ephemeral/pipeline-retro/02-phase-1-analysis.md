## 1. Structure Analysis: Was the 4-Tier Architecture Effective?

### What the Routing Artifact Specifies

The routing artifact (`artifact-routing.md`, lines 461-512, "Brief Template Structure") defines a 4-tier structure with specific line budgets:

| Tier | Name | Budget | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| Tier 1 | IDENTITY | 15 lines | Soul constraints as world-description |
| Tier 2 | PERCEPTION PHYSICS | 8 lines | Thresholds as natural laws |
| Tier 3 | COMPOSITIONAL FRAMEWORKS | 50 lines | Multi-coherence, metaphor, density, content-form, creative authority, CSS values |
| Tier 4 | DISPOSITION | ~40 lines | D-01 through D-08 |
| Appendix | CONTENT MAP | ~30-50 lines | Per-section analysis, metaphor seeds |

**Specified total:** ~93-113 lines for the constraint layer, plus content map appendix.

### What the Brief Actually Produced

| Tier | Actual Lines | Budget | Delta | Assessment |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Tier 1: IDENTITY | 20 lines (L7-L28) | 15 | +5 | Slightly over but well-spent |
| Tier 2: PERCEPTION | 9 lines (L30-L41) | 8 | +1 | Near-perfect |
| Tier 3: COMPOSITIONAL | 57 lines (L45-L98) | 50 | +7 | Over, but justified by content-specific enrichment |
| Tier 4: DISPOSITION | 25 lines (L102-L127) | ~40 | -15 | SIGNIFICANTLY under budget |
| Appendix: CONTENT MAP | 35 lines (L130-L164) | ~30-50 | On target | Well within range |
| **TOTAL** | **164 lines** | **~143-163** | **+1 to +21** | Within acceptable range |

### Verdict: Structure is EFFECTIVE but Tier 4 is Under-Invested

The 4-tier architecture IS the right structure. Each tier serves a distinct cognitive function for the builder:

- **Tier 1 (IDENTITY)** sets the world-frame. The builder reads "Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved." and enters a mental space. This is prerequisite for all subsequent composition.
- **Tier 2 (PERCEPTION)** establishes physics. The calibration language ("15 = subtle, 25 = confident, 50 = dramatic") gives the builder a perceptual vocabulary, not just a pass/fail threshold.
- **Tier 3 (COMPOSITIONAL)** provides the page-specific creative brief. This is where the brief assembler adds the most value -- translating generic frameworks into content-specific instructions.
- **Tier 4 (DISPOSITION)** shifts the builder's cognitive mode from COMPLYING to COMPOSING. This is where the brief fell short.

The structural flaw is that Tier 4 (DISPOSITION) received only 25 lines vs the 40-line budget -- a 37.5% under-investment. Each D-instruction was compressed to 3-4 lines, losing the PURPOSE + VOCABULARY format the recipe specifies. D-01 through D-08 in the brief are adequate summaries but lack the specific CSS technique vocabulary that the full recipe provides (e.g., D-04's "Scale break: headline 2.5x body size" technique list is absent from the brief).

**Recommendation:** Tier 4 should use its full 40-line budget. The extra 15 lines should come from Tier 3, which has some redundancy with the Content Map appendix.

---

## 2. Voice Quality Analysis

### Tier 1: "World-Description" Voice

**Target voice:** "This world IS / You ARE" (per ITEM 92, D01-D03, L238; ITEM 141, D01-D03, L316)

**What the brief produced (lines 9-27):**

> "Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved. There are no soft edges in this world."
> "Light is direct. Nothing floats. Nothing hovers above the page. Surfaces sit flat against each other."
> "The page has a spine. Content lives within 940-960px. The spine holds."
> "This is a warm world. Colors carry warmth -- red leads (#E83025), cream grounds (#FEF9F5), near-black anchors (#1A1A1A). Five accent colors complete the palette, all warm."

**Assessment: EXCELLENT.** This is the best section of the brief. The voice achieves world-description convincingly. "There are no soft edges in this world" is world-building, not prohibition. "The page has a spine. Content lives within 940-960px. The spine holds." transforms a container-width constraint into a physical metaphor. The builder enters a world rather than receiving a checklist.

**Specific strengths:**
- Line 9: "Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved." -- Two sentences. First establishes (world), second elaborates (action). This is the ideal pattern.
- Line 13: "The page has a spine." -- Content width as anatomy, not specification.
- Line 15: "This is a warm world. Colors carry warmth." -- Sensory framing before hex values.
- Line 17: "Three typefaces. No more." -- Authority through restraint. The period after "No more" closes the door.

**One weakness:** Line 23 ("Borders speak. 4px = primary emphasis. 3px = section-level. 1px = subtle articulation. This hierarchy is absolute.") drifts toward specification voice. The values are necessary, but "This hierarchy is absolute" is prohibition voice, not world-description. A world-description would be: "Borders have three weights: thick borders announce, medium borders organize, thin borders whisper."

### Tier 2: "Natural-Law" Voice

**Target voice:** Perception thresholds as "physics of this world"

**What the brief produced (lines 31-41):**

> "Adjacent backgrounds differ by at least 15 RGB points. Below that, the human eye cannot distinguish them. 15 is the floor, not the target. Calibration: 15 = subtle, 25 = confident, 50 = dramatic. Use the full range."
> "Letter-spacing below 0.025em is invisible."
> "When padding-bottom + margin-bottom + padding-top between content blocks exceeds 120px total, the eye registers a void -- the page appears broken, not breathing."

**Assessment: STRONG.** The natural-law voice works well in lines 33-34 ("Below that, the human eye cannot distinguish them"). The calibration inclusion (15 = subtle, 25 = confident, 50 = dramatic) is critical -- this is what prevents the Flagship's "calibrationally flat" failure pattern.

**Strengths:**
- "Below that, the human eye cannot distinguish them" -- Physics, not rule.
- "the page appears broken, not breathing" -- Perceptual consequence, not threshold number.
- "15 is the floor, not the target" -- Explicitly prevents threshold gaming (the lesson from ITEM 9, D18-D20).

**Weaknesses:**
- Line 35: "Letter-spacing below 0.025em is invisible." is too terse. The compositional range (0.03-0.05em) is mentioned in the next sentence but the law/calibration structure established for backgrounds isn't replicated here.
- Line 41: "Container width: 940-960px. Content beyond 960px loses the reader's eye." is specification voice, not natural-law voice. A natural-law version would be: "The eye loses its anchor beyond 960px. Content drifts."

### Tier 3: Mixed Voice (Compositional + Technical)

Tier 3 appropriately shifts to a more technical voice. The multi-coherence section (lines 47-61) is prescriptive but necessarily so -- it tells the builder what channels to shift at each boundary. The structural metaphor section (lines 63-71) returns to evocative language ("the production floor, dense machinery, peak compression").

**Assessment: ADEQUATE.** This tier's voice is necessarily hybrid -- it must be both inspirational (metaphor) and practical (channel lists, density arcs). The brief achieves this, though the content-form coupling section (lines 82-88) is the driest part of the entire brief.

### Tier 4: "Disposition" Voice

**Target voice:** PURPOSE + VOCABULARY (per council verdict, replacing "activation")

**What the brief produced (lines 104-127):**

Each D-instruction follows a consistent format: bold title + [EXPERIMENTAL] tag + PURPOSE paragraph. But the VOCABULARY component is absent or minimal. Compare:

**Brief's D-04 (lines 113-114):**
> "**PURPOSE:** Somewhere in Z4-Z6, create a moment that breaks the established pattern. Techniques: scale break (headline 2.5x body), color inversion (dark zone mid-page), layout rupture (grid after single-column), structural inversion (border-RIGHT in a border-LEFT page). 1-2 moments only. The Gas Town content has zero surprise moments currently -- fix this."

**Recipe's D-04 (artifact-builder-recipe.md, lines 386-404):**
Full PURPOSE + VOCABULARY with specific CSS technique details, content-specific observations ("Gas Town: ZERO surprise moments. Consistency as default = flatline"), and explicit conditions ("Requires COMPOSING mode. 1-2 moments only, in the SECOND HALF").

**Assessment:** The brief's D-04 is actually one of the BETTER dispositions because it includes the technique list inline. But other dispositions (D-06 "Negative Space as Shape", D-07 "Edge Intentionality") lost their technique vocabulary entirely in compression. D-07 in the brief is 3 lines; the recipe version is 12 lines with 5 specific CSS techniques (hover states, tabular-nums, ::selection colors, print styling, first/last child treatments).

**Overall voice assessment:** The brief achieves world-description voice in Tier 1 (9/10), natural-law voice in Tier 2 (7/10), and adequate mixed voice in Tier 3 (7/10). Tier 4's disposition voice is underdeveloped (5/10) due to the 15-line under-investment.

## 3. Length Analysis: 164 Lines

### The Budget Framework

The manifest specifies:
- Constraint layer: ~93-113 lines (Tiers 1-4)
- Content map appendix: ~30-50 lines
- Total brief: ~123-163 lines

At 164 lines, the brief is at the upper edge of the specified range. However, the actual constraint layer is ~111 lines (Tiers 1-4, lines 7-127), and the content map is 35 lines (lines 130-164). This puts the constraint layer at the high end of its budget and the content map at the low end of its budget.

### Is 164 Lines Too Short?

**No.** 164 lines is approximately correct for COMPOSED mode content. The question is not total length but ALLOCATION.

**The allocation problem:** The brief allocates 57 lines to Tier 3 (COMPOSITIONAL) and only 25 to Tier 4 (DISPOSITION). The recipe artifact (840 lines) cannot be meaningfully compressed into 25 lines. The allocation should be closer to 45/35 (Tier 3/Tier 4), which would still total 80 lines for both tiers while giving disposition its due weight.

**What the builder actually needs more of:** The builder needs specific CSS technique vocabulary in Tier 4 -- the techniques from D-07 (hover states, tabular-nums, zone-specific ::selection colors, print styling, first/last child edge treatments) are the kind of specifics that distinguish COMPOSED from APPLIED output. These were lost in compression.

### What About the Content Map?

The content map appendix (35 lines, lines 130-164) is well-proportioned. It contains:
- Zone architecture table (7 lines, good density)
- Content tensions (5 lines, correctly prioritized)
- Reader profile (5 lines, all 5 axes addressed)
- Density arc (5 lines, with ASCII visualization)

The only notable omission is the **metaphor seeds section** from Phase 0's content map. The original content map (66 lines) contained a "Metaphor Seeds" section (lines 39-47) with 3 candidates, risk ratings, and a recommendation. The brief's appendix does NOT reproduce this -- instead, the selected metaphor appears in Tier 3 (lines 63-71). This is actually a better placement decision, since the builder should receive the SELECTED metaphor in the compositional tier, not a menu of candidates.

---

## 4. Content-Specific Enrichments: What Was Missed?

### What the Brief Got Right

1. **The factory metaphor was correctly selected and mapped** (lines 63-71). The Town/Rig/Human level mapping to Z1-Z2/Z3-Z4/Z5-Z6 is structurally sound and native to the content.

2. **Content-form coupling per zone** (lines 82-88) correctly identifies each zone's register: Z1=NARRATIVE, Z2=NARRATIVE+REFERENCE, Z3=REFERENCE, Z4=REFERENCE+CODE, Z5=NARRATIVE+REFERENCE, Z6=CODE+REFERENCE.

3. **Zone boundary prescriptions** (line 59): "Z2->Z3 is the biggest shift -- entering the 8-role architecture (all 6 channels shift)" is exactly the kind of content-specific guidance that makes this a COMPOSED brief, not a generic one.

4. **Reader profile integration** (lines 153-156): The expert reader classification (75-80% on expert axis) correctly drove decisions like "Minimal header, fast entry" and "High info density tolerance. 3-4 components/viewport acceptable."

5. **Content tensions** (lines 145-150): All 4 tensions from Phase 0 are preserved, with correct dominance markings. The identification of #2 (Individual vs Colony) as the metaphor-shaping tension is correct.

### What Was Missed

#### BLOCKING

**B1: Concept-based CSS custom property naming was under-specified.**

Line 71 says: "Name CSS custom properties by CONCEPT: `--factory-intake`, `--factory-floor`, `--factory-output` -- not by position (`--bg-z1`). Concept-based naming is the strongest single indicator of composed mode."

This is present but provides only 3 example property names. The recipe (artifact-builder-recipe.md, lines 105-126) emphasizes that concept-based naming is "THE SMOKING GUN" (line 121) and "the strongest single indicator of composed vs applied mode" (line 122). The brief should have expanded this with 6-8 example properties spanning all 6 CSS channels, not just backgrounds. For example:
- `--factory-intake-bg`, `--factory-intake-text`, `--factory-intake-density`
- `--factory-floor-bg`, `--factory-floor-border`, `--factory-floor-spacing`

Without a fuller vocabulary, the builder may default to concept names for backgrounds only and positional names for typography/spacing.

**B2: Transition type vocabulary is absent.**

The brief mentions "at least 3 distinct transition types" (line 61) and defines them (light/medium/heavy), but does NOT map them to specific zone boundaries. Compare:

Brief (line 61): "Use at least 3 distinct transition types: light (1px border + 48px gap = legato), medium (3px border + 80px gap = breathing rest), heavy (colored background + text = full stop)."

What should exist: "Z1->Z2: light (legato -- the manifesto flows into the mental model). Z2->Z3: heavy (full stop -- the production floor announces itself). Z3->Z4: medium (breathing rest after dense roles)." etc.

This content-specific mapping of transition types to zone boundaries is the kind of enrichment the brief assembler should produce. Without it, the builder must invent the mapping from scratch, which is exactly the kind of "relationship regeneration" that the pipeline research says dies in compression (ITEM 15-19, D12-D14).

#### SIGNIFICANT

**S1: D-07 technique vocabulary was stripped.**

D-07 "Edge Intentionality" in the brief (lines 122-123) lost 5 specific CSS techniques:
1. Hover states revealing hidden content (table row tint, link border)
2. Typographic micro-refinement (tabular-nums, text-indent)
3. Zone-specific ::selection colors
4. Print-specific styling (@media print)
5. First/last child edge treatments

These are the specific vocabulary items that make the difference between a builder who deploys 2 edge refinements (APPLIED) and one who deploys 6+ (COMPOSED). The recipe lists these explicitly (artifact-builder-recipe.md, lines 457-462). Their absence from the brief is a direct compression loss.

**S2: The emotional arc framework was compressed away.**

The recipe (lines 481-510) provides a full emotional arc assessment framework:
- 4 registers (AUTHORITY constant, SURPRISE rare peak, DELIGHT steady, CLOSURE earned)
- Specific CSS techniques per register
- Gas Town historical scores per register (Authority 7/10, Delight 2/10, Closure 5/10)

The brief has NO explicit emotional arc framework. D-03 covers authority, D-04 covers surprise, D-05 covers closure, D-07 covers delight -- but they're presented as independent instructions, not as a coordinated arc with relative weight targets. The builder receives 8 dispositions without understanding that they are 4 emotional registers deployed through 8 instructions.

**S3: Quality floor metrics are absent from the brief.**

The recipe specifies a quality floor: >=14 mechanisms, >=800 CSS lines, >=3 channel shifts. The gate runner checks these after the fact, but the builder never sees them. This is BY DESIGN (per manifest: "Builder never sees quality floors"). However, the brief could have included an aspirational framing: "Build with 800-1200 CSS lines total" (which it does at line 98) without specifying it as a gate threshold. The mechanism count target is entirely absent -- the builder has no sense of how many mechanisms to aim for.

#### MINOR

**M1: The ASCII density arc diagram could include height estimates.**

Line 76-79 shows the density arc but the height estimates (Z1 ~500px, Z2 ~900px, etc.) are only in the Content Map appendix (line 79 of the brief). Moving them adjacent to the density arc diagram would create a single visual reference point.

**M2: The perception calibration table is inline, not tabular.**

The routing artifact specifies a tabular perception calibration table (artifact-identity-perception.md, lines 262-268) with Floor/Compositional/Dramatic columns. The brief inlines this as prose within each threshold. A compact table would be more scannable for a builder during active construction.

**M3: Component adoption target is vague.**

Line 94: "Aim for 8+ component library classes." This is correct per the quality floor but gives no guidance on WHICH components suit Gas Town content. The content map identifies code blocks, ASCII diagrams, tables, comparison matrices, and pull quotes -- the brief could have named specific component classes from components.css (e.g., `.code-snippet`, `.decision-matrix`, `.callout--essence`, `.bento-grid`).

---

## 5. Routing Artifact Template Clarity

### Does artifact-routing.md contain the brief template structure clearly enough?

**Yes, with one critical gap.**

The routing artifact's "Brief Template Structure" section (lines 461-512) clearly defines:
- 4 tiers with line budgets
- Sub-sections within Tier 3 (5 sub-sections + CSS value table)
- Content map appendix specification
- Reader profile integration point

**The critical gap:** The routing artifact describes the STRUCTURE of the brief but not the VOICE of each tier. It says "Tier 1: IDENTITY (15 lines) -- 10 soul constraints as WORLD-DESCRIPTION" but does not provide a template sentence or voice example. A fresh instance reading this artifact knows WHAT goes in Tier 1 but not HOW to write it.

**The Brief Assembler Extraction Guide** (MANIFEST.md, lines 227-231) partially addresses this:
> "INCLUDE VERBATIM: Phase 1 file-reading instructions (Step 1.1-1.3), mechanism minimums, disposition D-01-D-08 instructions"
> "SUMMARIZE: Phase 2 creative decision framework (key questions, not full detail)"
> "REFERENCE (not inline): Phase 3-6 deploy steps"
> "PRESERVE FORMAT: The output must read as a recipe (sequenced verbs: Read, Select, Deploy, Assess) not a checklist"

But this guidance is in the MANIFEST, not in the routing artifact itself. A fresh Brief Assembler receiving only artifact-routing.md (as the manifest's file routing table specifies) would not see this extraction guide.

**Recommendation:** Add a "Brief Voice Guide" section to artifact-routing.md with:
1. One example sentence per tier showing the target voice
2. The extraction priority (VERBATIM / SUMMARIZE / REFERENCE)
3. The format imperative (recipe, not checklist)

---

## 6. Prompt Template for the Brief Assembler

Based on this analysis, the following prompt template should be codified for the Brief Assembler agent:

### Recommended Prompt Template

```
You are the Brief Assembler for Pipeline v3. Your job is to produce an
Execution Brief (~130-160 lines) that a builder agent will use to construct
a single HTML page.

## Your Inputs
1. Content Map from Phase 0 (~30-50 lines) -- what the content IS
2. Soul constraints from artifact-identity-perception.md "1.2 Soul Constraints"
   -- extract ONLY the "World-description" field from each SC table
3. Perception thresholds from artifact-identity-perception.md "2.2 Core Thresholds"
   + "2.3 Perception Calibration Table"
4. Builder recipe phases from artifact-builder-recipe.md
5. Disposition D-01 through D-08 from artifact-builder-recipe.md "PHASE 4"
6. tokens.css and components.css (for reference, not inclusion)

## Your Output Structure

### Tier 1: IDENTITY (~15-20 lines)
Voice: WORLD-DESCRIPTION. "This world IS" / "You ARE in a world where..."
Write the 10 soul constraints as if describing a physical place the builder
will inhabit. NO prohibition language ("do not", "never", "fail if").
Include hex values inline with sensory language.

### Tier 2: PERCEPTION PHYSICS (~8-10 lines)
Voice: NATURAL LAW. "The human eye cannot..." / "Below X, this becomes invisible."
Include the calibration table: floor/compositional/dramatic for each threshold.
Explicitly state "X is the floor, not the target" for each threshold.

### Tier 3: COMPOSITIONAL FRAMEWORKS (~45-50 lines)
Voice: MIXED (inspirational + technical).
Sub-sections (all required):
a. Multi-Coherence: 6 channels listed. Content-specific boundary prescriptions
   for EACH zone transition (which channels shift, by how much, why).
b. Structural Metaphor: The selected metaphor with 3-level mapping to zones.
   8+ concept-based CSS custom property examples spanning all 6 channels.
c. Density Arc: ASCII diagram + zone heights + pattern name.
d. Content-Form Coupling: Per-zone register classification with CSS implications.
e. Creative Authority: 80% authority statement + component adoption guidance.
   Name 5+ specific component classes from components.css suited to this content.
f. CSS Value Table: Reference to tokens.css + key vocabulary summary.
g. Transition Vocabulary: 3 transition types mapped to SPECIFIC zone boundaries.

### Tier 4: DISPOSITION (~35-40 lines)
Voice: PURPOSE + VOCABULARY. Each D-instruction gets 4-5 lines.
Format for each: purpose sentence + 3-5 specific CSS techniques as vocabulary.
D-01 through D-08 ALL included. [EXPERIMENTAL] tag on each.
Content-specific observations where available (e.g., "Gas Town has zero
surprise moments -- fix this").

### Content Map Appendix (~30-40 lines)
Reproduce from Phase 0 with these sections:
- Zone Architecture table
- Content Tensions (with metaphor-shaping tension identified)
- Reader Profile (all 5 axes)
- Density Arc (duplicate from Tier 3 for builder reference)

## Format Rules
1. The brief must read as a RECIPE, not a checklist. Sequenced, not enumerated.
2. NO gate thresholds visible to builder. NO "FAIL if" language.
3. NO prohibition list. Soul constraints as world-description only.
4. Builder sees ONE mode (COMPOSED or APPLIED) implicit in the brief format.
5. Content-specific enrichments throughout -- the brief is for THIS content,
   not for generic content.
6. Total budget: 130-160 lines. Tier 4 MUST get its full budget.
```

### Key Differences from What Was Produced

1. **Tier 3 sub-section g (Transition Vocabulary)** is new -- requires content-specific transition mapping
2. **Tier 4 budget enforcement** -- "MUST get its full budget" prevents the 37.5% under-investment
3. **Component naming** -- "Name 5+ specific component classes" prevents vague guidance
4. **CSS custom property expansion** -- "8+ examples spanning all 6 channels" prevents background-only naming
5. **Voice examples per tier** -- makes the voice target concrete, not abstract

---

## 7. Sonnet vs Opus Quality Delta

### What a Sonnet Brief Assembler Produces

The actual brief was produced by Sonnet (per the task context). Analyzing the output:

**Sonnet's strengths in this brief:**
- Excellent Tier 1 voice quality (world-description achieved)
- Precise line budget adherence for Tiers 1-3
- Clean structural organization
- Accurate extraction from source artifacts
- Zero factual errors in content map reproduction

**Sonnet's weaknesses:**
- Tier 4 under-investment (25 lines vs 40 budget) -- Sonnet may have run out of creative energy or prioritized Tier 3 over Tier 4
- Missing relationship synthesis (transition type -> zone boundary mapping)
- Missing technique vocabulary expansion (D-07 techniques stripped)
- No emotional arc framework synthesis (4 registers presented as 8 independent instructions)
- Concept-based property examples limited to 3 (backgrounds only)

### What an Opus Brief Assembler Would Likely Produce

Based on observed Opus behavior across this project's history:

1. **Relationship synthesis.** Opus would likely produce the transition-type-to-boundary mapping that Sonnet omitted. The research finding that "relationships die in compression" (ITEM 20, D12-D14) is precisely the kind of cross-cutting insight Opus excels at regenerating. Opus would read the 6 channels + 6 zone boundaries and produce a 6x6 matrix of what shifts where -- this is compositional thinking, not extraction.

2. **Technique vocabulary density.** Opus would likely preserve the full D-07 technique list and ADD content-specific applications. Where Sonnet strips to "Edge Intentionality: every edge is a decision," Opus would write "Edge Intentionality: tabular-nums on the 8-role table headers. Zone-specific ::selection (red in Z1-Z2, dark in Z3-Z4, muted in Z5-Z6). Print stylesheet with monospace for code zones."

3. **Emotional arc framing.** Opus would likely synthesize D-03/D-04/D-05/D-07 into a coordinated emotional arc, making the relationship between disposition instructions and emotional registers explicit rather than implicit.

4. **Content-specific CSS suggestions.** Opus would likely produce concept-based property examples across ALL 6 channels, not just backgrounds. This is the kind of generative elaboration that distinguishes Opus's compositional mode from Sonnet's compliance mode.

### Estimated Quality Delta

| Dimension | Sonnet Brief | Opus Brief (estimated) | Delta |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| Tier 1 voice quality | 9/10 | 9/10 | 0 |
| Tier 2 natural-law voice | 7/10 | 8/10 | +1 |
| Tier 3 compositional richness | 7/10 | 9/10 | +2 |
| Tier 4 disposition density | 5/10 | 8/10 | +3 |
| Relationship synthesis | 4/10 | 8/10 | +4 |
| Content-specific enrichment | 6/10 | 8/10 | +2 |
| **Overall brief quality** | **6.3/10** | **8.3/10** | **+2.0** |

**The delta is LARGEST in exactly the areas that matter most:** relationship synthesis and disposition density. These are the dimensions that distinguish COMPOSED from APPLIED output. The Sonnet brief is a GOOD extraction (accurate, well-structured, correct voice in Tiers 1-2) but a MEDIOCRE composition (missing relational enrichments, under-invested disposition).

### The Implicit Guidance Factor

The task context notes: "The orchestrator had months of context and may have given the brief assembler implicit guidance beyond what's in the artifacts."

This is a critical observation. The brief's Tier 1 voice quality (9/10) is SUSPICIOUSLY good for a Sonnet operating from artifacts alone. The routing artifact does NOT contain voice examples -- it says "world-description" but doesn't show what world-description prose looks like. The identity-perception artifact (556 lines) contains the soul constraints in TABLE format with World-description/CSS rule/Gate check fields.

**Hypothesis:** The orchestrator provided voice guidance in the Brief Assembler's prompt that is not recorded in the artifacts. Sentences like "Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved." may have been GIVEN to the Sonnet, not generated by it. If so, the effective quality of the Sonnet brief assembler is LOWER than the output suggests -- it was partially pre-composed by the orchestrator's Opus instance.

**If this hypothesis is correct:** The Sonnet brief assembler is effectively a TEMPLATE FILLER, not a COMPOSER. It takes pre-composed voice examples and fills in the content-specific details. This would explain both the high Tier 1 quality AND the low Tier 4 quality -- the orchestrator provided voice for Tiers 1-2 (which it had strong models for) but not for Tier 4 (which requires generative composition).

**This is the strongest argument for Opus brief assembler:** Not because Opus writes better prose (Sonnet's prose is fine), but because Opus performs relationship synthesis and technique vocabulary expansion that Sonnet cannot. The brief assembler's job is not extraction -- it is COMPOSITION of a new document from multiple sources. That is inherently an Opus task.

## 8. Detailed Line-by-Line Assessment

### Lines 1-3: Header

```
# Execution Brief: Steve Yegge and Gas Town

Mode: **COMPOSED** | Zones: **6** | Metaphor: **Industrial Factory / Refinery**
```

**Assessment:** Clean header with key routing decisions visible at a glance. The mode/zones/metaphor summary is a good practice -- the builder knows immediately what tier they're building at. This should be codified in the template.

### Lines 7-28: Tier 1 IDENTITY (20 lines)

10 constraints as 10 paragraphs. Each uses world-description voice. Specific assessment:

- L9-10: "Every surface is sharp..." -- EXCELLENT world-description
- L11: "Light is direct." -- EXCELLENT, no shadows as physics
- L13: "The page has a spine." -- EXCELLENT metaphor for container width
- L15: Warm palette -- GOOD, hex values embedded in sensory language
- L17: Font trinity -- GOOD, clean and authoritative
- L19: No gradients -- GOOD, "Color is flat" is world-description
- L21: Zero decorative -- ADEQUATE, "earns its place" is slightly prohibition-adjacent
- L23: Border hierarchy -- MIXED, values are good but "This hierarchy is absolute" is prohibition voice
- L25: Header DNA -- GOOD, "signature" framing
- L27: Typography -- GOOD, "Text breathes at 1.7" is sensory

**Average quality: 8.5/10.** The voice is consistently achieved with minor drifts.

### Lines 30-41: Tier 2 PERCEPTION (9 lines)

5 thresholds as 5 natural laws.

- L33-34: Background delta -- EXCELLENT, includes calibration range
- L35-36: Letter-spacing -- ADEQUATE, terse but correct
- L37-38: Stacked gap -- GOOD, "broken, not breathing" is perceptual
- L39: Single property max -- GOOD, structural alternative offered
- L41: Container width -- ADEQUATE, repeats Tier 1's spine metaphor

**Average quality: 7/10.** The calibration for backgrounds is excellent; other thresholds lack equivalent calibration detail.

### Lines 45-98: Tier 3 COMPOSITIONAL (57 lines)

6 sub-sections covering multi-coherence, metaphor, density, content-form, creative authority, CSS values.

- L47-61: Multi-coherence -- STRONG. 6 channels listed, 4 directions described, zone-specific prescriptions for all 5 boundaries. This is the brief's richest section.
- L63-71: Structural metaphor -- STRONG. Three-level mapping (Town/Rig/Human) with zone ranges. Concept-based naming instruction is present but thin (3 examples).
- L73-79: Density arc -- GOOD. ASCII diagram + zone heights + pattern identification.
- L82-88: Content-form coupling -- ADEQUATE. Per-zone classifications are present but dry (no CSS implications stated per zone).
- L90-94: Creative authority -- GOOD. 80% authority framed correctly. Component guidance present but generic ("Aim for 8+ component library classes" without naming them).
- L96-98: CSS value table -- ADEQUATE. Just a reference to tokens.css with summary stats.

**Average quality: 7/10.** Multi-coherence is the standout sub-section; content-form coupling is the weakest.

### Lines 102-127: Tier 4 DISPOSITION (25 lines)

8 dispositions in 25 lines = 3.1 lines average per disposition.

- D-01 (L104-106): 3 lines. PURPOSE present, VOCABULARY absent. "Let the content's register drive your CSS decisions" is good purpose but no technique list.
- D-02 (L107-109): 3 lines. PURPOSE present, VOCABULARY present but thin. "A boundary that changes three channels is a doorway to a new space" is excellent metaphor.
- D-03 (L110-112): 3 lines. PURPOSE present, technique list present (4 items). This is the best-compressed disposition.
- D-04 (L113-114): 4 lines. PURPOSE + techniques + content-specific note. "The Gas Town content has zero surprise moments currently -- fix this." is direct and actionable.
- D-05 (L116-117): 3 lines. PURPOSE present with 3 dimensions listed. Missing closure timing ("only in final 2-3 viewports").
- D-06 (L119-121): 3 lines. PURPOSE present with "breathing room" guidance. Missing calibration ("80-120px gap before footer").
- D-07 (L122-123): 3 lines. PURPOSE present. VOCABULARY absent. The 5 specific CSS techniques from the recipe are missing entirely.
- D-08 (L125-126): 2 lines. Skeleton test purpose. Adequate but the shortest instruction.

**Average quality: 5/10.** D-03 and D-04 are adequate; D-07 and D-08 are significantly under-developed.

### Lines 130-164: Content Map Appendix (35 lines)

- Zone architecture table (L132-141): GOOD. All 6 zones with density, content, pacing, direction.
- Content tensions (L143-150): GOOD. All 4 tensions with dominance and metaphor-shaping identification.
- Reader profile (L152-156): GOOD. Expert axis position, info density tolerance, entry velocity preference. All 5 axes addressed compactly.
- Density arc (L158-164): GOOD. Repeats Tier 3's arc with internal Z6 shift noted.

**Average quality: 8/10.** The appendix is well-proportioned and complete.

## 9. Enrichment Recommendations (Ranked)

### BLOCKING (Must fix before next pipeline run)

**B1: Codify the Brief Assembler prompt template.**
The current pipeline has NO codified prompt for the Brief Assembler. The routing artifact describes the structure but not the voice. The manifest describes the extraction priorities but they're in the wrong file. A standalone prompt template (as sketched in Section 6 above) must be created and placed in the routing artifact or as a new standalone file.

**B2: Enforce Tier 4 budget allocation.**
Add a binary rule to the Brief Assembler prompt: "Tier 4 MUST be >= 35 lines. If Tier 3 exceeds 50 lines AND Tier 4 is under 35 lines, compress Tier 3 to fund Tier 4." The current brief's 25-line Tier 4 lost critical technique vocabulary.

**B3: Require content-specific transition mapping.**
Add to Tier 3 template: "Map each of the 3 transition types to specific zone boundaries. The builder must receive WHICH transition at WHICH boundary, not just the vocabulary of transition types."

### SIGNIFICANT (Should fix before next pipeline run)

**S1: Add voice examples to routing artifact.**
One example sentence per tier:
- Tier 1: "Every surface is sharp. Corners are cut, not curved."
- Tier 2: "Adjacent backgrounds differ by at least 15 RGB points. Below that, the human eye cannot distinguish them."
- Tier 3: "Z2->Z3 is the biggest shift -- entering the 8-role architecture (all 6 channels shift)."
- Tier 4: "PURPOSE: Somewhere in Z4-Z6, create a moment that breaks the established pattern. Techniques: scale break, color inversion, layout rupture."

**S2: Require concept-based property examples across all 6 channels.**
The brief provided 3 background-only examples (`--factory-intake`, `--factory-floor`, `--factory-output`). The template should require 8+ examples spanning backgrounds, typography, spacing, borders, accents, and components.

**S3: Require named component classes from components.css.**
Instead of "Aim for 8+ component library classes," the brief should name 5+ specific components suited to the content: ".code-snippet (Z3/Z4/Z6 code blocks), .decision-matrix (Z6 comparisons), .callout--essence (Z1 philosophical quotes), .bento-grid (Z3 role specifications), .stats-bar (Z2 mental model metrics)."

**S4: Add emotional arc synthesis to Tier 4 preamble.**
Before D-01, add 3 lines: "These 8 instructions create 4 emotional registers: AUTHORITY (constant, D-03), SURPRISE (rare, D-04), DELIGHT (steady, D-07), EARNED CLOSURE (final, D-05). Deploy all 4, but only SURPRISE and CLOSURE have specific timing -- D-04 in the second half, D-05 in the final 2-3 viewports."

**S5: Use Opus for Brief Assembler.**
The manifest already specifies "Brief Assembler (Opus)" (line 112, MANIFEST.md; line 436, artifact-routing.md). The delta analysis in Section 7 estimates +2.0 overall quality, with the largest gains in relationship synthesis (+4) and disposition density (+3) -- the exact dimensions the current brief under-performs on. This is not a preference but a quality-critical model selection.

### MINOR (Nice to have)

**M1: Tabular perception calibration format.**
Replace the inline prose calibration with a compact 5-row table (Property | Floor | Compositional | Dramatic).

**M2: Adjacent density arc + height estimates.**
Move zone height estimates from the content map appendix to adjacent to the Tier 3 density arc diagram.

**M3: Add conviction statement template.**
The manifest requires the builder to output a conviction statement as a separate file. The brief should include a prompt for this: "Before building, state your conviction in 2-3 sentences: What is this page about? What metaphor governs it? What is its emotional arc?"

## 10. Summary

The Phase 1 Brief Assembly produced a 164-line document that is structurally sound, correctly voiced in Tiers 1-2, and content-specific in Tier 3's zone boundary prescriptions. The brief's greatest strength is its Tier 1 world-description voice, which is among the best examples of the "this world IS" framing observed in the pipeline's history.

Its greatest weakness is Tier 4 under-investment (25 lines vs 40 budget), which stripped the technique vocabulary that distinguishes COMPOSED from APPLIED disposition deployment. The builder received purposes without vocabulary -- like being told "play jazz" without being shown the chord progressions.

The 4-tier structure is the right architecture. The voice targets (world-description, natural-law, mixed, PURPOSE+VOCABULARY) are correct. The issue is allocation discipline and relationship synthesis, both of which are addressable by:

1. Codifying the prompt template with budget enforcement
2. Requiring content-specific transition mapping
3. Using Opus for the Brief Assembler (estimated +2.0 quality delta)

The page's final score of 175/200 and PA-05 3/4 COMPOSED suggests the brief was GOOD ENOUGH to enable composed output but not rich enough to enable DESIGNED output. The gap between 3/4 and 4/4 is likely traceable, at least in part, to the brief's missing relationship synthesis and technique vocabulary -- exactly the dimensions that Opus would be expected to improve.

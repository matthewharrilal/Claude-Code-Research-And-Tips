## Executive Summary

The Post-CD Pipeline is not a single linear process but a **two-track execution architecture** spanning 9 phases from CD completion to full migration. The fundamental architectural innovation is the recognition that content requires two categorically different execution modes:

- **Track 1 (Assembly)**: Deterministic pattern matching + mechanical component composition (~40-50% of pages, 45-90 min/page)
- **Track 2 (Composition)**: Tension-driven metaphor derivation + compositional layout generation (~50-60% of pages, 3-5 hours/page)

**Critical bottleneck:** Track 2 creative capacity (metaphor collapse is irreducibly creative, not parallelizable).

**Timeline range:** 150-325 hours total (was 34-70 before two-track discovery)

**Files analyzed:** 13 pipeline docs + 2 skills = ~13,340 lines total

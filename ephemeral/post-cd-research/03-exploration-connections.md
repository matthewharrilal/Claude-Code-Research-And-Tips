# Post-CD Pipeline Exploration Connections
## How DD, OD, AD, CD Explorations Relate to the Post-CD Pipeline

**Research Task:** Understand how the Post-CD Pipeline relates to DD, OD, and CD explorations

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Author:** exploration-connector (post-cd-pipeline-research team)

---

## Executive Summary

The Post-CD Pipeline is NOT a separate invention — it is **the operational expression of accumulated exploration intelligence**. DD, OD, AD, and CD explored *what* patterns exist. The pipeline operationalizes *how* to apply them to real content at scale. The relationship is **bidirectional**:

1. **Explorations → Pipeline (VOCABULARY):** Every validated pattern from DD/OD/AD/CD becomes a pattern option in the pipeline's classification engine
2. **Pipeline → Explorations (VALIDATION):** The pipeline's two-track reality (assembly vs. composition) actually **validates CD-006** as a pilot migration — proving the system is complete

**Critical discovery:** The pipeline IS the design mind applying itself. Track 1 uses explorations as templates. Track 2 uses the tension-composition skill (which was developed FROM high-quality explorations like DD-006, OD-006, AD-006, CD-006).

---

## 1. The Exploration Chain → Pipeline Flow

### 1.1 Stage 2: Density Dimension (DD) → Pipeline Vocabulary

**What DD Explored:** Visual rhythm patterns — how sparse/dense alternation creates breathing

**DD Explorations:**
- Location: `design-system/validated-explorations/density/`
- DD-001 Breathing (PULSE), DD-002 Gradient (CRESCENDO), DD-003 Islands, DD-004 Layers (GEOLOGICAL), DD-005 Rivers (TIDAL), DD-006 Fractal
- Average score: 34.5/40
- 18 DD-F findings

**How Pipeline Consumes DD:**

1. **Content Analysis (Phase B):** Density pattern assignment
   - Tutorial content → CRESCENDO (progressive build)
   - Q&A content → PULSE (alternating rhythm)
   - Task clusters → ISLANDS (discrete groups in sparse ocean)
   - Confidence-graded content → GEOLOGICAL (stratified layers)

2. **Track 1 Assembly:** Density pattern is SELECTED from DD vocabulary
   - Page classified as "tutorial" → lookup table → CRESCENDO + F-Pattern
   - Designer doesn't *invent* density — DD already discovered it

3. **Track 2 Composition:** Density is ONE of the metaphor's physical properties
   - Metaphor selection (e.g., "geological strata") → inherits GEOLOGICAL density
   - Skill enrichment research proved: DD-006 Fractal's 5-scale rhythm is a METAPHOR-DRIVEN pattern (implicit metaphor: "recursive structure")

**Key DD Finding for Pipeline:**
- **DD-F-006 (Fractal self-similarity):** Applied to ALL explorations, verified in AD at 5 scales (AD-F-027), bounded at 5 (AD-F-028). The pipeline MUST maintain fractal rhythm across all migrated pages.
- **DD-F-010:** "Organization should SERVE density" — ELEVATED by OD to "organization IS density"

**The Connection:** DD patterns are the pipeline's RHYTHM vocabulary. Every page receives a density assignment. DD explorations are the proof that these rhythms work.

---

### 1.2 Stage 3: Organization Dimension (OD) → Pipeline Classification Engine

**What OD Explored:** Information organization patterns — how content structure shapes cognitive flow

**OD Explorations:**
- Location: `design-system/validated-explorations/organizational/`
- OD-001 Conversational (37/40), OD-002 Narrative, OD-003 Task-Based, OD-004 Confidence, OD-005 Spatial, OD-006 Creative (37/40, crown jewel with 5 fractal scales)
- Average score: ~35.5/40 (v3 post-re-enrichment)
- 17 OD-F findings + 94 EXT-* bespoke findings

**How Pipeline Consumes OD:**

1. **Content Classification Table (Track 1):**
   ```
   Content Type              → OD Pattern     → Track Assignment
   "How do I do X?" (steps)  → Task-Based     → Track 1 (assembly)
   "How does X work?"        → Narrative      → Track 1 (assembly)
   "What is X?" (Q&A)        → Conversational → Track 1 (assembly)
   "Should I use X?"         → Confidence     → Track 2 candidate
   "What's available?" (map) → Spatial        → Track 1 (assembly)
   Multiple of above         → Creative       → Track 2 candidate
   ```

2. **OD-F-005 Identity:** "Organization IS Density"
   - This is THE central pipeline insight
   - When you classify content as "Tutorial" (OD-002 Narrative), you are SIMULTANEOUSLY choosing CRESCENDO density
   - The pipeline doesn't make two separate decisions — it makes ONE decision expressed through two lenses

3. **Track 2 Addition Test:**
   - OD-006 Creative/Compound pattern is the PROOF that some content cannot be assembled mechanically
   - OD-006 cycled through all 5 organizational modes — this IS Track 2 composition
   - The pipeline's two-track reality validates OD-006's compound approach

**Key OD Findings for Pipeline:**
- **OD-F-005 / OD-F-MP-001:** Organization IS Density — the 3-way unification (org = density = axis)
- **OD-F-FL-001:** Organizational patterns imply axis preferences (the transitive chain)
- **OD-F-007:** Mode-transition breathing (48px+) — required when pages mix organizational modes

**The Connection:** OD patterns are the pipeline's CLASSIFICATION ENGINE. Content type → organizational pattern → density pattern → axis pattern. OD explorations proved these mappings work.

---

### 1.3 Stage 4: Axis Dimension (AD) → Pipeline Spatial Vocabulary

**What AD Explored:** Spatial layout patterns — how component positioning shapes attention flow

**AD Explorations:**
- Location: `design-system/validated-explorations/axis/` (RE-AUDIT REQUIRED per MEMORY.md)
- AD-001 Z-Pattern, AD-002 F-Pattern, AD-003 Bento Grid, AD-004 Spiral, AD-005 Choreography, AD-006 Compound (38/40)
- Average score: 36.2/40
- 28 AD-F findings (AD-F-001 through AD-F-028)

**How Pipeline Consumes AD:**

1. **Axis Pattern Assignment:**
   - Tutorial → F-Pattern (progressive descent, density builds downward)
   - Q&A → Z-Pattern (eye sweeps from question to answer)
   - Task clusters → Bento Grid (discrete cells in grid)
   - Confidence levels → Spiral (border-weight gradient encodes strata)

2. **AD-F-023 ATTENTION TOPOLOGY:**
   - This is the meta-equivalence: axis = density = organization = **one phenomenon**
   - The pipeline doesn't apply THREE patterns (density + org + axis) — it applies ONE attention topology expressed through three lenses
   - Track classification is classifying TOPOLOGY, not three separate variables

3. **AD-F-025 Transition Grammar:**
   - 5×5 matrix classifying transitions between axis patterns
   - Smooth (4 pairs), Bridge (10 pairs), Breathing (6 pairs)
   - The pipeline uses this when pages mix patterns (hybrid pages)

4. **Track 2 Metaphor Connection:**
   - AD-004 Spiral uses border-weight gradient (4px/3px/1px) as flat 2D encoding of depth
   - This is a METAPHOR ("geological strata") expressed through CSS
   - The tension-composition skill generates similar metaphor-to-CSS translations

**Key AD Findings for Pipeline:**
- **AD-F-023:** ATTENTION TOPOLOGY — the unification principle
- **AD-F-024:** Compound is SEQUENTIAL, not simultaneous
- **AD-F-025:** Transition grammar (guides hybrid page composition)
- **AD-F-027:** DD-F-006 fractal verified at 5 scales
- **AD-F-028:** No 6th fractal scale — 5 is the hard limit

**The Connection:** AD patterns are the pipeline's SPATIAL VOCABULARY. Every page receives an axis assignment. AD explorations proved the 3-way equivalence. AD-006 Compound IS the Track 2 pilot (multiple patterns sequentially on one page).

---

### 1.4 Stage 5: Combination Dimension (CD) → Pipeline Completeness Validation

**What CD Will Explore:** Pattern combination grammar — how validated patterns combine on single pages

**CD Status:** PENDING (Phase 0 not yet started per directory structure)

**Planned CD Explorations:**
- CD-001 through CD-005: Pattern combination tests
- CD-006: Crown jewel / PILOT MIGRATION (per `01-CD-EVOLVED-VISION.md`)

**How Pipeline Will Consume CD:**

1. **CD-006 as Pilot Migration:**
   - Recommendation from evolution research: CD-006 should NOT be synthetic content
   - Instead: take a REAL documentation page and migrate it using the full pipeline
   - If it scores 39-40/40 without requiring design system updates → system is COMPLETE
   - This validates the pipeline BEFORE the freeze line

2. **Combination Recipes:**
   - R-5 Combination Theory contains 6 recipes (component pairings that work)
   - CD tests these at scale: Code + Reasoning (Recipe 1), Task + Decision (Recipe 2), etc.
   - Validated recipes become Track 1 assembly instructions

3. **Component Density Tolerance (DD-F-013 Gate):**
   - CD must answer: when two patterns combine, do components split or absorb both?
   - Expected answer: components maintain individual tolerance; combination adds transition cost but doesn't change intrinsic tolerance
   - The pipeline uses this to decide when to split content into separate sections

4. **Completeness Gate:**
   - CD cannot declare itself done until every component is used in at least one exploration
   - CD cannot declare itself done until R-5 is evaluated (39 findings)
   - CD cannot declare itself done until transition grammar holds at combination scale
   - This IS the pipeline freeze validation — if CD passes, the system is complete

**Key CD Questions for Pipeline:**
- **Q1 (Density tolerance):** How do components absorb combined patterns?
- **Q3 (Attention topology):** Does the 3-way equivalence hold when multiple patterns coexist?
- **Q9 (Anti-patterns):** What breaks in combination that doesn't break in isolation?

**The Connection:** CD validates the pipeline's READINESS. If CD-006 pilot succeeds, the pipeline works. If CD discovers gaps, they're fixed BEFORE the freeze. CD is the last chance to update the design system.

## 2. How Explorations Shaped the Two-Track Reality

### 2.1 Track 1 (Assembly) = DD/OD/AD Pattern Application

**What Track 1 Does:**
- Read content → classify type → lookup pattern triple (org + density + axis)
- Assemble from Tier 1+2 component library
- Apply R-5 rules (velocity, temperature, weight)
- Verify transition grammar
- Build in 45-90 minutes

**Which Explorations Prove Track 1 Works:**

| Exploration | What It Proved | How Track 1 Uses It |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| DD-002 Gradient (CRESCENDO) | Progressive density build works | Tutorial pages use CRESCENDO |
| OD-001 Conversational (PULSE) | Q&A alternation creates rhythm | Q&A pages use PULSE + Z-Pattern |
| OD-003 Task-Based (ISLANDS) | Task clusters work in sparse ocean | Task pages use ISLANDS + Bento |
| AD-002 F-Pattern | Progressive descent follows eye movement | Narrative pages use F-Pattern |
| AD-003 Bento Grid | Grid cells as discrete containers | Task pages use Bento Grid |

**The Evidence:** Track 1 pages receive patterns that were VALIDATED through explorations. The pipeline doesn't invent — it applies proven patterns to matching content.

---

### 2.2 Track 2 (Composition) = High-Quality Exploration Methodology

**What Track 2 Does:**
- Read content → identify tension → find metaphor → generate composition
- Invoke tension-composition skill (~150 min)
- Produce Tier 3 fresh CSS from metaphor mechanisms
- Build in 3-5 hours

**Which Explorations Prove Track 2 Works:**

The skill enrichment research analyzed 15 HTML layouts and identified the TOP 3:
1. **Playbook Elevation Map** (rich metaphor: topographic map)
2. **Gas Town Floor Plan** (rich metaphor: architectural blueprint)
3. **Boris Geological Core** (rich metaphor: geological strata)

**All three are Track 2-style compositions.** They used:
- Multi-axis questioning (FEEL, UNDERSTAND, DO, BECOME)
- Tension derivation (warmth vs. austerity, etc.)
- Metaphor collapse (geological strata → concentric layers)
- Compositional layout generation (border-weight gradients, padding compression)

**The Crown Jewel Progression:**
- DD-006 Fractal (36/40): Applied ONE principle (fractal) deeply
- OD-006 Creative (37/40): Cycled through 5 organizational modes, 5 fractal scales
- AD-006 Compound (38/40): Sequential combination of all prior patterns
- CD-006 target (39-40/40): **Real content pilot migration**

**The Pattern:** Crown jewels are ALWAYS compositional, not mechanical. They score highest because they apply the system's REASONING, not just its rules. This IS the Track 2 methodology.

**How Explorations Became the Skill:**

The tension-composition skill (839 lines, `~/.claude/skills/tension-composition/SKILL.md`) was developed from:
- Analyzing DD-006, OD-006, AD-006 (what made them score highest?)
- Skill enrichment research (root cause: metaphor-driven visual compromise)
- Perceptual auditing research (8 quantitative guardrails to prevent compromise)

**The skill IS the distilled methodology from high-quality explorations.**

## 3. The Handoff Chain: How Explorations Flow to Pipeline

### 3.1 The Handoff Document Pattern

Each stage produced a **HANDOFF** document briefing the next stage:
- `HANDOFF-DD-TO-OD.md`: OD reads this FIRST before building
- `HANDOFF-OD-TO-AD.md`: AD reads this FIRST (references OD-F-005, R-2 at 0%)
- `HANDOFF-AD-TO-CD.md`: CD reads this FIRST (references AD-F-023, AD-F-024, AD-F-025)

**The Pipeline Handoff:**
- `HANDOFF-CD-TO-MIGRATION.md` (not yet written) will be THE migration playbook
- Recommendation from `01-CD-EVOLVED-VISION.md`: "The handoff should not be a passive summary — it must be an active playbook"

**What It Contains:**
- Pattern selection guide for every content type
- Confirmation that pattern vocabulary is complete
- CD-F findings summary with migration implications
- Whether 3-way equivalence held, extended, or was bounded
- ACCUMULATED-IDENTITY-v3 changes vs v2

---

### 3.2 The Provenance Chain

Every pipeline decision cites a finding:
- "Apply CRESCENDO" → cites DD-F-002
- "Organization IS Density" → cites OD-F-005
- "Axis IS Density IS Organization" → cites AD-F-023
- "Sequential, not simultaneous" → cites AD-F-024
- "Apply transition grammar" → cites AD-F-025

**The Chain Backwards:**
```
Migration decision (Apply CRESCENDO to tutorial)
  ↓ cites
AD-F-008 (Decision matrix density validates CRESCENDO peak)
  ↓ builds on
OD-F-009 (Narrative CRESCENDO)
  ↓ builds on
DD-F-002 (CRESCENDO for progressive build)
  ↓ builds on
R3-012 (Density should build progressively)
  ↓ validated by
DD-002 Gradient exploration (35/40)
```

**Every pattern traces to research. Every research finding traces to an exploration.**

---

## 4. Component Extraction: What Gets Extracted FROM Explorations

### 4.1 The 4-Tier Component Taxonomy (From Component Research)

Component taxonomy research analyzed all 24 validated explorations (6 DD + 6 OD + 6 AD + 6 CD pending):

| Tier | What It Is | Extractable? | Source |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Tier 1 (Atoms)** | Design tokens, soul constraints | 100% (~80 lines CSS) | COMP-F findings (Stage 1) |
| **Tier 2 (Molecules)** | Styled elements (callouts, headers, code blocks) | 90%+ (~175 lines CSS) | DD/OD/AD explorations |
| **Tier 2.5 (Patterns)** | Reusable layout systems (bento grid, solid offset) | 70% (~145 lines CSS) | AD explorations |
| **Tier 3 (Organisms)** | Metaphor-driven spatial arrangements | 0-30% (prose only) | Crown jewels (DD-006, OD-006, AD-006) |

**Total extractable CSS: ~400 lines, covering 60-70% of any file.**

**What This Means:**
- Track 1 uses Tier 1+2+2.5 (assembly from library)
- Track 2 uses Tier 1+2 (library) + Tier 3 (generated fresh from metaphor)

---

### 4.2 What Gets Extracted FROM Each Exploration

**From DD Explorations:**
- Tier 2: Dark code blocks (DD-001/002 "Polished dialect")
- Tier 2: Breathing zones (DD-001 PULSE rhythm)
- Tier 3 strategy: CRESCENDO prose pattern (DD-002)
- Tier 3 strategy: ISLANDS spatial grouping (DD-003)
- Tier 3 strategy: Fractal self-similarity (DD-006, crown jewel)

**From OD Explorations:**
- Tier 2: Dark full-bleed header (universal across all 6 ODs post-unification)
- Tier 2: Zone tokens (bookends, landmarks) validated in OD-001/006
- Tier 2.5: Confidence border-weight gradient (OD-004)
- Tier 3 strategy: Q&A alternation (OD-001 Conversational)
- Tier 3 strategy: Narrative CRESCENDO (OD-002)
- Tier 3 strategy: Hub-spoke spatial (OD-005)

**From AD Explorations:**
- Tier 2.5: Bento grid (AD-003, 70% extractable)
- Tier 2.5: Solid offset (AD positioning technique)
- Tier 2.5: Scroll-witness (progressive reveal)
- Tier 3 strategy: Border-weight as flat 2D depth encoding (AD-004 Spiral)
- Tier 3 strategy: Sequential compound (AD-006)

**From CD Explorations (Pending):**
- Combination recipes (R-5 validated)
- Component density tolerance rules
- Multi-pattern transition strategies

**The Rule:** If it works across multiple content types, extract it (Tier 2/2.5). If it's metaphor-specific, document the strategy in prose (Tier 3).

---

## 5. The Skills: Distilled Exploration Intelligence

### 5.1 Tension-Composition Skill (Track 2 Driver)

**Location:** `~/.claude/skills/tension-composition/SKILL.md` (839 lines)

**What It Is:** The distilled methodology from DD-006, OD-006, AD-006 — how to produce high-quality compositional layouts

**The 6-Phase Pipeline:**
1. **Content Assessment** (5 min): Classify scope, identify sections
2. **Multi-Axis Questioning** (25 min): 4-14 axes (FEEL, UNDERSTAND, DO, BECOME + conditionals)
3. **Tension Derivation** (30 min): Addition Test, BECAUSE Test, richness scoring
4. **Metaphor Collapse** (45 min): 3-5 candidates, structural isomorphism ≥4, perceptual risk ≤2
5. **Compositional Layout** (35 min): Extract 5 physical properties, translate to CSS, enforce guardrails
6. **Output** (10 min): Final HTML + metadata

**Total: ~150 minutes (2.5 hours)**

**How It Connects to Explorations:**
- Phase 2 questioning = what made DD-006/OD-006/AD-006 rich (implicit metaphors)
- Phase 3 tension derivation = root cause analysis (metaphor-driven visual compromise)
- Phase 4 metaphor collapse = what made Boris Geological Core work (4+ isomorphisms)
- Phase 5 guardrails = 8 quantitative rules to prevent visual compromise

**The Skill IS the exploration methodology made reusable.**

---

### 5.2 Perceptual-Auditing Skill (Quality Gate for Both Tracks)

**Location:** `~/.claude/skills/perceptual-auditing/` (multiple files, ~2,089 lines total)

**What It Is:** The audit methodology from OD granular audit (17 agents, 89 findings), AD perceptual audit (24+ agents, 47 findings), and skill enrichment research

**The 3-Layer Architecture:**
1. **Layer 1: Binary Gates** (7 mandatory pass/fail)
2. **Layer 2: Structured Judgment** (PA-01 through PA-48 questions, 3 tiers)
3. **Layer 3: Free Perception** (unconstrained observations)

**How It Connects to Explorations:**
- PA-01 through PA-28: Original audit questions from OD/AD audits
- PA-42, PA-43, PA-44: Metaphor-awareness questions (added after skill enrichment)
- 8 quantitative guardrails: Derived from fixing 30 visual issues across 15 layouts

**The Skill IS the audit methodology made reusable.**

---

## 6. The Freeze Line: Why Explorations Must Be Complete First

### 6.1 The Post-CD Pipeline Timeline

```
Phase A: CD Completion (4-5h)
Phase B: Content Analysis (4-6h)
Phase C: Component Extraction (6-10h)
Phase D: Extraction Validation (1-2h)
Phase E: Migration Playbook v2 (4-5h)
Phase F: Pilot Migration (3-5h)
Phase G: Playbook Refinement (1-2h)
═══════════════════════ FREEZE LINE ═══════════════════════
Phase H+I: Full Migration (80-160h)
```

**What the Freeze Means:**
- After Phase G, NO changes to design system
- No new tokens, no new patterns, no new soul pieces
- Everything below the freeze uses ONLY what exists above

**Why Explorations Must Complete Before Freeze:**
- If DD/OD/AD/CD have gaps, migration discovers them mid-execution
- Migration cannot FIX gaps (system is frozen)
- Only options: accept imperfect coverage or violate the freeze

**CD-006 Pilot Validation:**
- IF CD-006 is a real content pilot
- AND it scores 39-40/40 without design system updates
- THEN the system is COMPLETE and migration can proceed safely

**The Explorations ARE the pre-freeze validation.** If they're incomplete, the pipeline inherits their incompleteness.

---

### 6.2 What Happens If Explorations Are Incomplete

**Scenario:** CD skips R-5 evaluation (39 findings at ~5% consumption)

**Impact on Pipeline:**
- Track 1 assembly has no validated combination recipes
- Component pairings (Code + Reasoning, Task + Decision) are untested
- Migration agents reinvent combinations from scratch on every page
- Inconsistency epidemic: page 1 uses one combination pattern, page 50 uses a different one for the same content type

**Scenario:** CD doesn't test transition grammar at combination scale

**Impact on Pipeline:**
- Hybrid pages (multiple organizational modes) have no grammar
- Migration agents guess at transition spacing (24px? 48px? 96px?)
- Some transitions feel smooth, others feel jarring — no consistency

**Scenario:** CD-006 is NOT a real content pilot

**Impact on Pipeline:**
- The completeness claim is UNVALIDATED
- Phase F pilot migration discovers gaps that should have been found in CD
- Too late to update the design system (already at Phase F)
- Accept imperfect coverage or violate the non-negotiable

**The Explorations MUST answer all questions BEFORE the freeze.**

---

## 7. Open Threads and Unresolved Questions

### 7.1 From Exploration Research

**DD-F-012 (Density implies axis):**
- DD stated: "Density patterns imply axis preferences"
- AD ELEVATED: "Axis IS density expressed spatially"
- Pipeline question: Is the org→density→axis chain ALWAYS transitive, or are there edge cases where content breaks the chain?

**OD-F-005 (Organization IS Density):**
- Validated across all 6 OD explorations
- Pipeline relies on this for classification
- Open question: Can content have MULTIPLE organizational modes simultaneously (not sequentially like AD-006)?

**AD-F-028 (No 6th fractal scale):**
- 5-scale model is bounded
- Pipeline assumes all pages fit within 5 scales
- Open question: Does combination create a meta-scale, or is 5 truly the hard limit?

---

### 7.2 From Pipeline Research

**Q1: Does everything go through the tension-composition pipeline's gate?**
- Current plan: Content Analysis (Phase B) pre-classifies Track 1 vs Track 2
- Alternative: ALL pages go through Phases 0-2 of skill, let the gate decide
- Pro: Single unified process
- Con: Adds 30-60 min to every Track 1 page

**Q2: Is Track 2 really 50-60% of pages?**
- Pipeline evolution research estimate: 50-60%
- Original plan assumed: 15-20%
- Actual split determines timeline (127-285 hours vs 40-90 hours)
- Phase B Content Analysis will settle this empirically

**Q3: Where exactly does the "abstraction cliff" fall?**
- Bento grid: Tier 2.5 (70% extractable) or Tier 3 (metaphor-dependent)?
- Confidence encoding: Tier 2.5 (border-weight gradients reusable) or Tier 3 (only works with layered content)?
- Phase C Extraction will draw this line empirically

**Q4: Does richer Tier 2.5 library reduce Track 2 percentage?**
- Hypothesis: More reusable patterns → more assembly → fewer composition pages
- Counterpoint: Track 2 is driven by content tension, not pattern availability
- Phase D Validation will provide evidence

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

### 8.1 The Relationship Is Bidirectional

**Explorations → Pipeline (VOCABULARY):**
- Every DD/OD/AD/CD pattern becomes a pipeline option
- Every finding becomes a pipeline constraint
- Every crown jewel methodology becomes a skill

**Pipeline → Explorations (VALIDATION):**
- Pipeline's two-track reality validates OD-006/AD-006 compound approach
- CD-006 pilot migration tests completeness before freeze
- Migration is the ultimate validation: if 75 pages migrate successfully, the explorations worked

---

### 8.2 The Pipeline IS the Design Mind Applying Itself

**Track 1:** The design system as **printing press** (apply templates)
- Uses explorations as reference: "Tutorial looks like DD-002 + OD-002 + AD-002"
- Mechanical pattern selection from validated vocabulary

**Track 2:** The design system as **alphabet and vocabulary** (compose fresh prose)
- Uses exploration METHODOLOGY (tension-composition skill)
- Generates Tier 3 fresh, like crown jewels did

**Both tracks consume the accumulated exploration intelligence. Neither invents from scratch.**

---

### 8.3 The Skills Are Distilled Explorations

**Tension-Composition Skill:**
- Phase 2 = DD-006/OD-006/AD-006 questioning methodology
- Phase 4 = metaphor collapse (what made Boris Geological Core work)
- Phase 5 = guardrails (what prevented visual compromise)

**Perceptual-Auditing Skill:**
- PA-01–PA-28 = OD/AD audit questions
- PA-42–PA-44 = metaphor-awareness (from skill enrichment)
- 8 guardrails = fixes from 30 visual issues

**The skills ARE the explorations, made operational.**

---

### 8.4 CD Validates Pipeline Readiness

**The Completeness Gate:**
- CD cannot declare done until every component used
- CD cannot declare done until R-5 evaluated (39 findings)
- CD cannot declare done until transition grammar holds at combination scale
- CD cannot declare done until CD-006 pilot succeeds (if pilot recommendation adopted)

**If CD passes the gate → pipeline is ready. If CD has gaps → pipeline inherits them.**

**CD is the last chance to update the design system before the freeze.**

---

## 9. Conclusion

The Post-CD Pipeline is not separate from DD/OD/AD/CD explorations — it IS their operational expression. The explorations discovered what patterns exist. The pipeline applies them to real content at scale.

**The relationship:**
- **DD/OD/AD** = The vocabulary (patterns validated through 18 explorations)
- **CD** = The grammar (how patterns combine, validated through 6 explorations)
- **Pipeline** = The translation engine (how to express real content in this language)

**The two-track reality:**
- **Track 1** uses explorations as templates (assembly from library)
- **Track 2** uses exploration methodology (tension-composition skill)

**The skills:**
- **Tension-composition** = distilled methodology from DD-006/OD-006/AD-006
- **Perceptual-auditing** = distilled audit process from OD/AD audits

**The validation:**
- If CD-006 pilot succeeds (39-40/40), the system is complete
- If explorations are incomplete, the pipeline inherits their incompleteness
- The freeze line means: explorations MUST be complete BEFORE migration begins

**The chain is complete. DD → OD → AD → CD → Pipeline. Every pattern traces backward. Every pipeline decision cites a finding. Every finding traces to an exploration.**

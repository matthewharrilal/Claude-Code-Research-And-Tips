## What Does ALWAYS FLAGSHIP Actually Simplify? Noise Removal Analysis

**Agent:** always-flagship (Opus)
**Task:** #25 METACOGNITIVE
**Date:** 2026-02-19

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes **~220 lines of tier-conditional logic** from the TC skill (11.4% of 1,932 lines), **~15 lines of tier references** from the PA skill (1.8% of 847 lines), **~15 lines** from compositional-core/CLAUDE.md, and **collapses** an entire routing section of PV2-FLAGSHIP-VARIANT.md. But the real simplification is **cognitive, not textual**: eliminating an entire DECISION CATEGORY (which tier?) that consumes agent attention at every fork.

The conventions brief **no longer needs** a tier classification section, tier-calibrated thresholds, graceful degradation protocols, or tier-conditional fractal requirements. It gains a single directive: **"Maximum intensity. Always."**

**Verdict:** ALWAYS FLAGSHIP simplifies significantly. It removes noise (classification machinery) without destroying signal (the actual compositional knowledge lives at Flagship tier anyway). The tier model's content was always DESCRIBING Flagship while routing most pages AWAY from it.

---

## 1. TENSION-COMPOSITION SKILL: TIER-CONDITIONAL LOGIC

### Total: 1,932 lines. Tier-conditional: ~220 lines (11.4%)

The TC skill contains tier logic concentrated in these regions:

### A. Step 0D: Tier Classification and Pipeline Routing (Lines 68-145)
**~77 lines.** This is the PRIMARY routing block.

**What it contains:**
- 4-row tier classification table (Floor/Middle/Ceiling/Flagship signal mapping)
- Mechanism count provenance (backward-engineered counts per tier)
- Natural landing zones per tier (build time x mechanism count)
- Middle-tier validation evidence
- Middle-tier SKIP instruction (skip Phases 1-3, go to Phase 4.0)
- 4 density PATTERN selection entries (CRESCENDO/F-PATTERN/BENTO/PULSE)
- Middle-tier output template
- Why Middle skips Phases 1-3 explanation
- Ceiling/Flagship routing instruction
- Graceful degradation protocol (3 items)
- Tier model hypothesis caveat
- Critical principle about Middle-tier richness
- 4-level deployment distinction (Floor/Middle/Ceiling/Flagship)

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes:** ALL of this. The entire 77-line block collapses to 0 lines. Every page runs the full pipeline (Phases 0-5). The Addition Test remains as the ONLY escape valve (cosmetic tension → flat mode, no metaphor). But no page gets routed to "skip Phases 1-3." No page gets "Floor" (Track 1 assembly). Every page gets maximum intensity.

**What signal is preserved?** The Flagship-tier deployment level description (line 142: "Multi-pattern COMPOSITION, 3+ density patterns with typed transitions") becomes the ONLY deployment level. All the LOWER-tier descriptions are noise — they describe what we explicitly do NOT want.

### B. Step 0D-CEILING: Ceiling Tier Context Box (Lines 148-165)
**~18 lines.**

**What it contains:**
- Instructions for Ceiling-routed content
- 7 specific requirements (metaphor mandatory, per-category minimums, reinforcing pairs, multi-channel coherence, 4-scale fractal, build time, container width)

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes:** The conditional wrapper ("If routed to Ceiling tier..."). The CONTENT of this box (metaphor mandatory, per-category minimums, etc.) is PRESERVED — it becomes universal, not conditional. This is signal that was gated behind a condition; ALWAYS FLAGSHIP makes it ungated. The box disappears but its contents promote to universal rules.

### C. Tier-Calibrated Mechanism Counts (Lines 83-97, 869-872, 1098-1102)
**~20 lines across 3 locations.**

Lines 83-97: Provenance paragraph explaining mechanism counts per tier.
Lines 869-872: Phase 4 tier-specific deployment levels.
Lines 1098-1102: Natural landing by tier in mechanism deployment section.

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes:** The Floor/Middle/Ceiling rows. Only the Flagship row survives: "16-18 mechanisms across all 5 categories + 3+ reinforcing clusters." The provenance paragraph simplifies from 4-tier explanation to single-tier explanation.

### D. Tier-Calibrated Fractal Requirements (Lines 1433-1436)
**~4 lines.**

```
- Floor: EXEMPT
- Middle: 2 scales minimum (Page + Component)
- Ceiling: 4 scales minimum
- Flagship: 5 scales required (all scales)
```

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes:** First 3 lines. Only "5 scales required (all scales)" survives.

### E. Tier-Calibrated Landmark Requirements (Lines 1481-1483)
**~3 lines.**

```
- Floor: Header + main content required. Footer optional.
- Middle-tier+: Header + main + footer ALL required.
- Ceiling/Flagship: Header + main + footer + transition grammar.
```

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes:** First 2 lines. Only the Ceiling/Flagship requirement survives.

### F. Middle-Tier Validation Evidence and References (~40 lines scattered)
Lines 99-100, 134-136, 942, 1092, 1325, 1438-1441, 1487-1507, 1547, 1599-1618.

These are scattered references to "Middle experiment," "Middle-tier baseline," "Middle-tier can ship at 66.5%." They serve as validation EVIDENCE for the tier model. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, the tier model does not need validation because it does not exist. These references become historical context at best, noise at worst.

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes:** ~40 lines of Middle-tier evidence. The FINDINGS survive if they're universally useful (e.g., "82 CPL = +2 over spec" is useful regardless of tier). But the tier-conditional framing ("Middle-tier can ship at...") is noise.

### G. Metaphor Scoring Rubric Tier Gate (Line 705)
**~1 line.** "MANDATORY for Ceiling+ Tier" header.

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes:** The "for Ceiling+ Tier" qualifier. The rubric becomes MANDATORY for all pages. This is pure noise removal — if every page IS Flagship, every page already exceeds "Ceiling+."

### H. Pattern Selection for Middle (Lines 101-126)
**~25 lines.** The entire PATTERN selection block (CRESCENDO/F-PATTERN/BENTO/PULSE) with content-type mapping and justification template.

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP status:** COMPLEX. The patterns are NOT tier-exclusive — they're useful spatial organization strategies. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, these patterns still exist but as OPTIONS within metaphor-driven composition, not as REPLACEMENTS for metaphor. The conditional routing ("For Middle-tier pages, SKIP Phases 1-3") is noise. The pattern descriptions themselves are signal. Resolution: Keep patterns as vocabulary in Phase 4; remove the routing logic.

### I. Graceful Degradation Protocol (Lines 129-133)
**~5 lines.** What to document when degrading from higher tier.

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP removes:** Entirely. There is no degradation. You never degrade. If content has no tension (Addition Test = YES), it enters FLAT MODE — but this is not degradation, it is content-form fit.

---

### TC SKILL SUMMARY

| Category | Lines | Noise? | Signal preserved? |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Step 0D routing table | 77 | YES — routing machinery | YES — Flagship deployment level promoted to universal |
| Ceiling context box | 18 | PARTIAL — wrapper is noise, contents are signal | YES — contents become universal rules |
| Mechanism count tiers | 20 | YES — 3 of 4 rows are noise | YES — Flagship row preserved |
| Fractal tier calibration | 4 | YES — 3 of 4 rows | YES — Flagship row |
| Landmark tier calibration | 3 | YES — 2 of 3 rows | YES — Flagship row |
| Middle evidence references | 40 | PARTIAL — findings useful, tier framing noise | PARTIAL — universal findings kept |
| Rubric tier qualifier | 1 | YES | YES — rubric becomes universal |
| Pattern selection routing | 25 | PARTIAL — routing is noise, patterns are signal | YES — patterns kept as vocabulary |
| Graceful degradation | 5 | YES | NO — concept eliminated |
| **TOTAL** | **~220** | **~180 pure noise, ~40 signal-in-noise-wrapper** | **All signal promotes to universal** |

**Net effect on TC skill:** ~1,932 lines → ~1,752 lines (~9.3% reduction). But the cognitive simplification is larger than the line reduction because the remaining 1,752 lines no longer require the reader to ask "which tier am I?" at every fork.

---

## 2. PERCEPTUAL-AUDITING SKILL: TIER-CONDITIONAL LOGIC

### Total: 847 lines. Tier-conditional: ~34 mentions, ~15 substantive conditional lines (1.8%)

The PA skill is MUCH less tier-contaminated than TC because PA is designed to MEASURE quality, not ROUTE to quality levels.

### Tier-Conditional Elements:

**A. PA-05c Expanded Sub-Dimensions (Line 105-122)**
"PA-05c Scoring (Ceiling+ only): All THREE sub-dimensions must PASS."

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:** The "(Ceiling+ only)" qualifier becomes noise. PA-05c scoring applies to ALL pages.

**B. PA-09 Severity Calibration (Lines 153-165)**
"MANDATORY for Ceiling+ audits."

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:** The "Ceiling+" qualifier is noise. Severity calibration applies to ALL pages.

**C. PA-17/PA-41 Elevation (Lines 202-214)**
"CEILING+ TIER ELEVATION (MANDATORY, NOT ADVISORY)."

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:** These are ALREADY elevated for the only tier that matters. The elevation instruction itself becomes redundant — there is no lower tier from which to elevate.

**D. Void Prevention Tier 4 (Lines 337-361)**
"Ceiling+ Only — MANDATORY."

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:** The "Ceiling+ Only" qualifier is noise. Void prevention applies to ALL pages.

**E. Mode 4 Integration references (Lines 360-363)**
"Embedded Mode Integration: Builders running Mode 1..."

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:** Mode selection is independent of tier. No change needed. BUT — if ALWAYS FLAGSHIP implies ALWAYS MODE 4 for verification, then Mode 1/2/3 descriptions become noise. This is a separate question from tier routing.

### PA SKILL SUMMARY

| Category | Lines affected | Effect |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| PA-05c "(Ceiling+ only)" | ~3 | Remove qualifier, apply universally |
| PA-09 severity | ~2 | Remove qualifier |
| PA-17/PA-41 elevation | ~5 | Remove elevation language (already elevated) |
| Void prevention | ~3 | Remove qualifier |
| Scattered "Ceiling+" references | ~5 | Remove qualifiers |
| **TOTAL** | **~15** | **All qualifiers removed, all rules apply universally** |

**Net effect on PA skill:** ~847 lines → ~832 lines (~1.8% reduction). Minimal line reduction but cognitive simplification: auditors never ask "is this Ceiling+ or not?" The answer is always yes.

---

## 3. PV2-FLAGSHIP-VARIANT.md: TIER ROUTING

### Status: Already 80% converted

The PV2-FLAGSHIP-VARIANT.md document was ALREADY written under the ALWAYS FLAGSHIP directive. It states on line 7: "Directives: ALWAYS FLAGSHIP | ALWAYS REMEDIATION-STYLE | FIRE AND FORGET" and on line 255: "ALWAYS FLAGSHIP: No tier routing. No classification. Every page gets maximum intensity."

### Remaining Tier References:

The document still contains:
1. **Wave 0 description** (line 288): "Phase 0: Content Analysis" — still references the TC skill's tier routing. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, Phase 0 does content assessment and scope assessment but NOT tier classification.
2. **Experiment descriptions** (lines 570-635): References to "Middle" recipe, "Middle experiment," tier-calibrated thresholds. These are experimental evidence, not routing logic.
3. **Middle-calibrated thresholds** (lines 979-989): 6 thresholds flagged as "Middle-calibrated" needing Flagship parameterization. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, these become the ONLY thresholds — they need to be set at Flagship values.
4. **Fat Core conventions brief** (lines 596-616): ~200-250 lines described. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, no tier section needed in the brief.

### Pipeline Architecture Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:

```
USER TYPES: /build-page path/to/content.md
                    |
                    v
    WAVE 0: TC (Enriched, Opus, ~30-60 min)
        Phase 0: Content Assessment + Scope (NO TIER CLASSIFICATION)
        Phase 1: Multi-Axis Questioning (ALWAYS)
        Phase 2: Tension Derivation + Addition Test
            |
        ADDITION TEST = ONLY ESCAPE VALVE
            |--- TENSION EXISTS --> Phase 3 Metaphor Collapse
            |--- NO TENSION -----> FLAT MODE (zones + recipe, no metaphor)
            |
        Phase 3.5: Lock-In Gate
        Phase 4T: Transition + Fractal Table
                    |
    WAVE 0.5: Metaphor Validation (Fresh-Eyes Opus, ~5-10 min)
                    |
    WAVE 0.9: Enriched Handoff Gate (8 binary checks)
                    |
    WAVE 1: Opus Builder (~90-150 min)
        9-Phase Build with Phase Lock + Micro-Gates
                    |
    WAVE 2: Dual-Layer Verification
        21 gates (15 T1 + 4 T2 + 2 T3)
        ALL at Flagship thresholds
                    |
    WAVE 3: Mode 4 PA (9 auditors + weaver, ~60 min)
                    |
    WAVE 4: Fix Cycle (up to 3x)
                    |
    OUTPUT: page.html + _pa-report.md + _build-log.md
```

**What disappeared:** The entire TIER CLASSIFICATION step in Phase 0. The routing table. The "skip Phases 1-3" shortcut. The Middle pattern-selection bypass. The Floor Track-1-assembly exit. The graceful degradation protocol.

**What remained:** The Addition Test (no-tension escape to FLAT MODE). This is NOT tier routing — it is content-form fit detection. Content with zero structural tension genuinely does not need metaphor. FLAT MODE applies soul constraints, deploys mechanisms via per-category minimums, and uses zone backgrounds — but without metaphor derivation.

---

## 4. COMPOSITIONAL-CORE/CLAUDE.md: TIER REFERENCES

### Total: 681 lines. Tier mentions: ~15

The compositional-core CLAUDE.md contains tier references primarily in:

1. **Track Classification section (lines 56-84):** The Addition Test routes to Track 1 (Assembly) or Track 2 (Composition). Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, Track 1 disappears — there is no "assembly-only" path. Every page gets Track 2 (Tension-Driven Composition). The Addition Test still determines whether metaphor is needed, but the execution intensity is always maximum.

2. **Phase D Validation Lessons (lines 642-656):** References to Phase D variants and tier model. These are historical lessons, not routing logic. They can stay as provenance but are no longer operational.

3. **Various "Middle-tier+" qualifiers:** Scattered throughout. Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP, all become universal.

### CLAUDE.md Under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:

The Track Classification section simplifies:

**BEFORE (2 tracks):**
```
Addition Test: "Can existing components fulfill this WITHOUT transforming their meaning?"
- YES → Track 1 (Assembly, 45-90 min)
- NO  → Track 2 (Composition, 3-5 hours)
```

**AFTER (1 track, 2 modes):**
```
Addition Test: "Does this content have structural tension?"
- YES → Full Pipeline (Metaphor-Driven Composition)
- NO  → Flat Mode (Maximum mechanisms, no metaphor)
Both: Maximum intensity. Both: Mode 4 PA.
```

Track 1 (Assembly) is eliminated. Even "simple" pages get per-category mechanism deployment, transition variety, fractal coherence at 5 scales, and Mode 4 PA. The execution time increases for what WAS Track 1 content, but quality becomes uniform.

---

## 5. CONVENTIONS BRIEF IMPACT

### What Gets DELETED from the conventions brief:

Under the existing architecture, the conventions brief (per PV2-FLAGSHIP-VARIANT.md, ~200-250 lines, 10 sections) includes tier-conditional content:

| Brief Section | Tier Content | ALWAYS FLAGSHIP Effect |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Soul (20 lines) | None — soul is universal | No change |
| Thresholds YAML (20 lines) | 6 Middle-calibrated values flagged | All values set to Flagship. No "Middle-calibrated" caveat. SIMPLER. |
| Anti-scale (5 lines) | None | No change |
| Multi-coherence binding (25 lines) | "FLAGSHIP ADDITION" label | Remove label. This is just... the rule. SIMPLER. |
| Fractal echo (20 lines) | "FLAGSHIP ADDITION" label, 4-tier calibration | Remove label, remove calibration table. "5 scales required." SIMPLER. |
| Compositional memory (30 lines) | "FLAGSHIP ADDITION" label | Remove label. SIMPLER. |
| Creative authority (20 lines) | None | No change |
| Flagship anti-patterns (15 lines) | "Flagship-specific" label | Remove label. These are just... anti-patterns. SIMPLER. |
| Required deliverables (15 lines) | None | No change |
| Process (15 lines) | None | No change |

**Total lines saved in brief:** ~10-15 lines of labels and caveats. But the COGNITIVE load saved is larger: the builder never reads "FLAGSHIP ADDITION" and thinks "is this relevant to me?" The answer is always yes. Every rule is just... a rule.

### What Gets ADDED to the conventions brief:

Nothing. ALWAYS FLAGSHIP adds no new content to the brief — it only removes conditional wrappers around existing content. The Flagship-tier rules ALREADY EXIST. They just stop being flagged as "Flagship-specific."

---

## 6. QUANTITATIVE SUMMARY

| File | Total Lines | Tier-Conditional Lines | % of File | Lines Removable | Signal Lost? |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| TC SKILL.md | 1,932 | ~220 | 11.4% | ~180 | NO — all signal promotes to universal |
| PA SKILL.md | 847 | ~15 | 1.8% | ~15 | NO — all qualifiers removed |
| PV2-FLAGSHIP-VARIANT.md | ~1,000+ | ~30 (non-directive) | ~3% | ~20 | NO — already ALWAYS FLAGSHIP |
| compositional-core/CLAUDE.md | 681 | ~15 | 2.2% | ~10 | NO — Track 1 elimination is the big change |
| **Conventions brief** | ~225 | ~15 | 6.7% | ~15 | NO — labels and caveats removed |
| **TOTAL** | **~3,685+** | **~295** | **~8%** | **~240** | **NO** |

---

## 7. THE DEEPER SIMPLIFICATION: COGNITIVE, NOT TEXTUAL

The ~240 removable lines understate the simplification. The real noise reduction is in **decision elimination**:

### Decisions Eliminated:

1. **"Which tier is this content?"** — The classification decision at Phase 0D. This was a judgment call that consumed agent attention, risked mis-classification, and created 4 different execution paths. ELIMINATED.

2. **"Should I skip Phases 1-3?"** — The Middle bypass. This was a tempting shortcut that saved build time but capped quality at "individual mechanism deployment." ELIMINATED.

3. **"Is this Ceiling+ or not?"** — The qualification check before PA-05c, PA-09 severity, PA-17/41 elevation, and void prevention. ELIMINATED.

4. **"Should I use Track 1 or Track 2?"** — The assembly vs. composition routing. ELIMINATED. (Addition Test determines metaphor vs flat mode, but execution intensity is always maximum.)

5. **"What tier minimum applies here?"** — Fractal scales, landmark requirements, mechanism counts, threshold values. ELIMINATED. Always 5 scales, always full landmarks, always Flagship thresholds.

6. **"Am I degrading? Do I need to document degradation?"** — The graceful degradation protocol (3 mandatory documentation items). ELIMINATED. No degradation exists.

### Decisions Preserved:

1. **"Does this content have structural tension?"** — The Addition Test. This is NOT tier routing — it is content-form fit. Content without tension genuinely should not have forced metaphor. PRESERVED.

2. **"Which metaphor?"** — The creative step. PRESERVED.

3. **"Which mechanisms?"** — Per-category deployment. PRESERVED.

4. **"Does this pass gates?"** — Verification. PRESERVED.

5. **"Does this pass PA?"** — Perceptual audit. PRESERVED.

---

## 8. DOES THIS SIMPLIFY OR COMPLICATE?

### SIMPLIFIES:

- **Agent cognitive load:** 6 decisions eliminated, 0 added.
- **File size:** ~240 lines removed, 0 added.
- **Execution paths:** 4 paths (Floor/Middle/Ceiling/Flagship) → 2 paths (metaphor/flat). 50% reduction.
- **Conventions brief:** No tier section. No "FLAGSHIP ADDITION" labels. No tier-calibrated threshold tables.
- **Gate thresholds:** One set of thresholds (Flagship), not 4 sets. No "Middle-calibrated, needs Flagship parameterization" caveats.
- **Mental model:** "Maximum intensity, always" vs "classify, route, calibrate, then execute."

### DOES NOT COMPLICATE:

The Flagship-tier rules already exist. They just stop being conditional. No new rules are created. No new complexity is introduced. The pipeline becomes a STRAIGHT LINE instead of a BRANCHING TREE.

### TRADE-OFFS:

1. **Build time increases for simple content.** What was a 30-45 minute Floor page becomes a 90-150 minute Flagship page. Cost per page increases ~3-4x for simple content. **Acceptable** if the user has decided quality > speed.

2. **Over-engineering risk for simple content.** A changelog page getting full metaphor derivation is overkill. **Mitigated** by the Addition Test: content with zero tension enters FLAT MODE, which applies maximum mechanism density WITHOUT metaphor. The metaphor is not forced; the INTENSITY is forced.

3. **Loss of the "quick and dirty" path.** Sometimes you just want a page shipped. Floor tier enabled that. **Acceptable** if the user's decision is "we have never seen 4/4, so we stop doing anything that isn't 4/4."

---

## 9. WHAT NOISE GETS REMOVED? WHAT SIGNAL IS PRESERVED?

### NOISE REMOVED (pure routing machinery with no compositional value):

| Noise | Lines | Why it's noise |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Tier classification table | 12 | Routing, not composition |
| Middle-tier SKIP instruction | 8 | Shortcut that caps quality |
| Middle pattern selection AS ROUTING | 10 | Routing wrapper around useful patterns |
| Graceful degradation protocol | 5 | Workaround for not doing the work |
| "FLAGSHIP ADDITION" labels | 5 | Label that says "this is extra" — under AF, nothing is extra |
| Tier-calibrated threshold tables (3 of 4 rows each) | 12 | Non-Flagship rows |
| "Middle-tier can ship at..." caveats | 8 | Permission to ship low quality |
| "Ceiling+ only" qualifiers in PA | 10 | Gatekeeping quality checks behind tier |
| Track 1 (Assembly) routing | 15 | Entire lower-intensity track |
| Tier model hypothesis caveats | 10 | The tier model no longer needs defending |
| **TOTAL NOISE** | **~95** | **Pure routing/classification/caveat machinery** |

### SIGNAL PRESERVED (compositional intelligence that was gated behind tiers):

| Signal | Location | Effect Under AF |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Metaphor is mandatory | 0D-CEILING box | Promotes to universal |
| Per-category minimums (S:1+, H:1+, C:1+, D:1+, N:1+) | 0D-CEILING box | Promotes to universal |
| Reinforcing pairs required (2+ encoding same semantic) | 0D-CEILING box | Promotes to universal |
| Multi-channel coherence | 0D-CEILING box | Promotes to universal |
| 5-scale fractal coherence | Fractal requirements | Promotes to universal (was 5 only for Flagship) |
| Full landmark requirements | Landmark gate | Promotes to universal |
| Density patterns (CRESCENDO/F-PATTERN/BENTO/PULSE) | Step 0D | Preserved as vocabulary, not routing |
| Build time expectations | Tier table | Flagship expectation becomes universal |
| Metaphor scoring rubric | Step 3.5G | Was "Ceiling+", now universal |
| PA-05c full sub-dimensions | PA skill | Was "Ceiling+ only", now universal |
| PA-09 severity calibration | PA skill | Was "Ceiling+", now universal |
| Void prevention (PA-50-53) | PA skill | Was "Ceiling+ Only", now universal |

**The pattern is clear:** ALWAYS FLAGSHIP doesn't destroy signal — it PROMOTES signal. Rules that were conditionally gated behind "if you're Flagship" become universal rules. The compositional intelligence was always there; it was just hidden behind routing conditions that most pages never triggered.

---

## 10. CONCLUSION

ALWAYS FLAGSHIP is a **simplification that increases quality by removing escape hatches.**

The tier model was designed when we thought most pages needed less intensity. The evidence says: the pages that got less intensity (Middle = 4/4, but "B+ effort"; Flagship = 1.5/4; Floor = 5 critical violations) never achieved what we wanted. Only CD-006 (which got MAXIMUM intensity from an Opus agent with full creative authority) achieved 39/40.

Removing tiers is not adding complexity. It is removing a DECISION LAYER (classify → route → calibrate) and replacing it with a CONSTANT (maximum). Constants are simpler than decisions. The pipeline becomes a straight line instead of a branching tree.

**The conventions brief under ALWAYS FLAGSHIP:** Shorter. Simpler. No tier section. No "FLAGSHIP ADDITION" labels. No threshold calibration tables with 4 rows where 3 are irrelevant. Every rule just IS.

**What the builder sees:** "Here are the rules. All of them apply. Build."

That's simpler than: "Here are the rules. Some apply if you're Flagship. Some apply if you're Ceiling+. Some apply if you're Middle+. First, figure out which tier you are."

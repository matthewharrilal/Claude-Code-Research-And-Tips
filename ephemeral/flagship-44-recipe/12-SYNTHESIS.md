## PART 1: SYNTHESIS ACROSS 5 CATEGORIES

### CATEGORY A: DEFINITION -- What IS Flagship 4/4?

**Consensus:** Flagship 4/4 DESIGNED is a THEORETICAL register above Middle 4/4 that has never been achieved. It is defined by 14 binary dimensions (Report 01), the compositional intelligence stack operating at full capacity (Reports 18-23), and the qualitative difference between mechanisms working independently (Middle) versus mechanisms working in concert encoding the same semantic concept simultaneously (Flagship).

**14 Dimensions (Report 01):** D-01 mechanism count (>=14, min 2/category), D-02 zone transitions (>=8, 2+ channels), D-03 channels per boundary (>=3, avg>=4), D-04 multi-coherence (>=3 instances), D-05 fractal scales (all 5), D-06 CSS lines (>=600), D-07 component types (>=8), D-08 designed moments (>=90% viewport), D-09 perceptibility (all CSS visible), D-10 semantic density (judgment), D-11 restraint (judgment), D-12 axis variety (>=3 patterns), D-13 unified metaphor (structural, governs CSS), D-14 creative surprise (judgment).

**Evidence status:** 7 PROVEN (demonstrated in CD-006 or Middle), 3 EXTRAPOLATED (partial evidence, threshold estimated), 2 THEORETICAL (D-04, D-13 -- zero evidence any artifact achieves these), 2 JUDGMENT (PA-only dimensions).

**CD-006 reclassification (Report 03):** CD-006 (39/40) passes ~8/14 dimensions. It is Middle/Ceiling tier, NOT Flagship. It demonstrates vocabulary fluency but not unified multi-coherence or structural metaphor across all sections. Report 03 provides devastating forensics: 41 mechanism instances, 11 boundaries, avg 3.36 channels per boundary, 5 scale levels. But the geological strata metaphor applies to ~1 of 8 sections, and multi-coherence is local (within zones) not global (across zones).

**The two registers of PA-05 4/4 (Reports 01, 02):** Middle 4/4 = every scroll position shows intentional composition. Flagship 4/4 = every scroll position shows intentional composition AND every designed moment participates in an integrated atmosphere. The difference is coherence -- mechanisms encoding the same concept simultaneously through multiple CSS channels vs. mechanisms independently solving separate problems.

**CONTRARIAN TEMPERING (Report 11, Challenge 1):** This distinction may not exist as a perceptual category. It may be a continuous spectrum, not a discrete register. The definition was derived from "what CD-006 lacks that a theoretically perfect page would have" -- extrapolation from absence. Confidence in challenge: HIGH. First experiment that produces two PA-05 4/4 pages will test whether the register shift is perceptible or taxonomic.

### CATEGORY B: CONDITIONS -- What Produces Flagship 4/4?

**Necessary conditions (Report 04):**
- N1: Opus model for builder (Sonnet compliance mode caps at 2.5/4)
- N2: Content structural heterogeneity (uniform register caps PA-05, Report 09)
- N3: Perception thresholds enforced (>=15 RGB, >=2px font-size, etc.)

**Conditionally necessary (Report 04):**
- CN1: Structural metaphor (may be replaceable by pure compositional skill)
- CN2: Multi-coherence planning (transition table or equivalent)

**Helpful but not required (Report 04):** Mechanism catalog access (H1), component library (H2), fractal echo table (H3), conviction card (H4), midpoint observation pause (H5), creative authority clause (H6), 5-question self-check (H7).

**Anti-conditions -- 14 suppressors (Report 05):** 5 ABSOLUTE (S-01 checklist format, S-02 prohibition overload, S-03 inverted quality routing, S-04 sub-perceptual emphasis, S-05 analytical pipeline) and 9 CONTEXTUAL (S-06 through S-14). Quality = (Skill x Coupling x Metaphor) / Active Suppressors. Fat Core + conventions brief neutralizes 11/14. Still active: S-05, S-09, S-14.

**4 suppressor chains (Report 05):** Chain A (format→tone→mode), Chain B (routing→reference→perception), Chain C (count→communication→capability), Chain D (typography→budget→borders→spacing). Each chain shows how suppressors cascade -- fixing one link may not break the chain.

**Compositional intelligence conditions (Report 06):** 5 producing conditions (Opus model, conventions format, convention tone, creative authority, metacognitive pauses). 5 destroying conditions (checklist format, prohibition overload, volume overload, recipe rigidity, analytical mode). FORMAT > VOLUME is the master finding.

**Compression as interference (Report 13):** Total research-to-CSS compression: 134,800:1. Quality = f(model_capability - instruction_interference). Optimal instruction volume: ~70-150 lines. Above 200 lines, interference overtakes benefit. The conventions brief at 230 lines is near the ceiling of beneficial volume.

**Recipe ceiling (Report 17):** Three recipe types -- Specification (ceiling 2.5/4), Procedural (ceiling 3.0-3.5/4), Dispositional (unknown, possibly 4/4). The 230-line conventions brief is PROCEDURAL. DESIGNED is a property of ATTENTION, not product or process. The recipe's job is "not to contain the answer but to create the silence in which the builder can hear the question." 4 builder cognitive modes: COMPOSING (4/4), PLANNING-THEN-EXECUTING (4/4), COMPLYING (1.5/4), REPAIRING (2.5/4). The brief must create COMPOSING mode.

---

### CATEGORY C: RECIPE -- What Goes Into the Builder?

**6 mandatory files (Report 07):** conventions-brief.md (~230 lines, PRIMARY), tokens.css (174 lines), prohibitions.md (353 lines), mechanism-catalog.md (~870 lines), merged-components.css (~500 lines), content markdown (varies). Total: ~2,120 lines, ~225 effective instruction lines.

**Conventions brief draft (Report 10):** 10 sections, ~230 lines, hybrid prose+YAML. Tone: WORLD DESCRIPTION ("describes the world you are building inside") not CONSTRAINT LIST. Key features: conviction card anchors compositional memory, 5-question self-check protocol, creative authority clause, 3-boundary transition grammar (SMOOTH/BRIDGE/BREATHING), multi-coherence binding rules, fractal echo table requirement, compositional memory protocol for long builds.

**Stack integration edits needed (Report 23):** 4 targeted changes to the brief: 5-line stack overview preamble, reposition Section 3 as anti-scale, add restraint column to transition table template, add 1 worked boundary example. These add ~20 lines and encode 72% of the stack into the brief.

**Telescope + microscope integration (Report 14):** Volume is the problem, not cognitive mode. Under 200 lines, telescope (WHY) and microscope (WHAT) fuse naturally. The brief already achieves this because its format is "describe the world + provide thresholds" -- WHY and WHAT are interleaved at every section.

**ALWAYS FLAGSHIP simplification (Report 15):** Removes ~220 lines of tier-conditional logic from TC, ~15 from PA, ~15 from CLAUDE.md. Eliminates 6 decisions (which tier? skip phases? calibrate gates?), adds 0. Pipeline becomes a straight line. The tier model's content was always DESCRIBING Flagship while routing most pages AWAY from it.

**Verification recipe (Report 08):** 3-tier gate system (12 composition-critical / 7 identity / 2 behavioral). 8 Tier 5 PA questions (PA-60 through PA-67) distributed among existing 9 auditors. Success bar: PA-05 >= 3.5 AND Tier 5 >= 6/8. 6 Flagship threshold elevations over Middle defaults. Gate execution: 4 micro-gates during build + full run after build + Mode 4 PA.

---

### CATEGORY D: COMPOSITIONAL INTELLIGENCE STACK

**The stack is a PRISM, not a pipeline (Report 23).** Every CSS decision participates in all layers simultaneously. A single `background: #F0EBE3` simultaneously: crosses L1 threshold, defines L2 section identity, shifts L3 chromatic channel, participates in L4 multi-coherence (if other channels co-shift), contributes to L5 density/restraint.

**L2 Scales (Report 18):** 5 architectural zoom levels (Navigation ~1440px, Page ~960px, Section ~200-400px, Component ~40-100px, Character ~12-20px). Dependency chain: build bottom-up, establish largest first. KEY FINDING: 2 strong scales beat 5 weak scales. Middle achieved 4/4 with 2 scales. Flagship achieved 1.5/4 with 5 attempted scales. Character scale is OPTIONAL -- only after Page+Section are perceptibly established.

**L3 Channels (Report 19):** 6 CSS property groups (Chromatic, Typographic, Spatial, Structural, Behavioral, Material). 4 primary channels carry semantic direction; Behavioral and Material are enhancement-only. CD-006 achieves avg 3.4 channels per boundary through LAYOUT DIVERSITY (rotating grid patterns guarantee multi-channel shifting as emergent property). Flagship achieves same count through PROPERTY MODULATION (requires explicit per-boundary management, less robust). Layout diversity is the easier, more reliable path.

**L4 Multi-coherence (Report 20):** 3+ channels shifting in SAME semantic direction at a zone boundary. Define direction BEFORE building: "deeper" = darker + tighter + heavier; "lighter" = warmer + generous + thinner. 6 operational rules: name direction in CSS comment, count channels, verify direction consistency, use transition table, vary intensity, squint test. Practical scale: 0-1 channels = FLAT, 2 = FUNCTIONAL, 3 = DESIGNED, 4-5 = COMPOSED, 6 = FLAGSHIP.

**L5 Anti-scale (Report 21):** Richness = semantic density x restraint x spatial confidence (multiplicative). Semantic density ~70% computable (mechanism ratio, component density). Restraint ~60% instructable (frequency limits, waste elimination). Spatial confidence ~40% computable (variation within a system). 15 programmatic gates (SD-01-04, RE-01-05, SC-01-06). Recipe achieves ~70% of anti-scale quality; 30% requires builder compositional intelligence. NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT for Flagship.

**Fractal self-similarity (Report 22):** Structural echo (binary: present/absent) + parametric echo (gradient: CSS values modulate by zone). CD-006: 4/5 strong + 1 moderate. Flagship: 0/5 strong despite attempting all 5 (dependency chain violated -- built character before establishing page). Realistic minimum: 3/5 strong (Navigation + Page + Component). COHERENCE GRID: fractal (5 scales vertical) x multi-coherence (6 channels horizontal) = 30-cell grid. Flagship fills >=60%.

**Stack integration (Report 23):** Brief already encodes 72% of stack (165/230 lines). 4 targeted additions (+20 lines) complete the encoding. Weaver Stack Verdict proposed: ENSEMBLE (all layers audible) / CHOIR (unison) / SOLO (one dominates) / BROKEN (contradict). PA-65 (music analogy) IS the stack integration question.

---

### CATEGORY E: CONTRARIAN TEMPERING

**16 challenges filed (Report 11).** 8 findings survived. 8 weakened but not overturned.

**Findings that SURVIVED challenge:**
1. Perception thresholds (>=15 RGB, etc.) -- non-negotiable, empirically validated
2. FORMAT > VOLUME -- SPECIFICITY > LENGTH, confirmed across all experiments
3. Multi-coherence as quality lever -- 3+ channels = the DESIGNED threshold
4. Fat Core architecture -- eliminate Boundary 3 compression
5. Anti-scale model -- density x restraint x confidence as governing principle
6. Content heterogeneity predicts PA-05 -- uniform register = lower scores
7. Conventions brief over recipe -- world description > constraint list
8. Opus unconditional for builders -- Sonnet compliance mode caps quality

**Findings that WEAKENED under challenge:**
1. "Flagship 4/4 is a real, distinct register" -- may be continuous spectrum (HIGH confidence in challenge)
2. "PA-05 cannot distinguish Middle from Flagship" -- Tier 5 questions may be circular (MODERATE confidence)
3. "CD-006 is Ceiling, not Flagship" -- reclassification serves rhetorical purpose (MODERATE confidence)
4. "14 dimensions define Flagship" -- 2 key dimensions (D-04, D-13) are THEORETICAL with zero evidence
5. "230-line brief is optimal" -- may be above interference threshold, 50-line dispositional variant untested
6. "Recipe ceiling is real" -- N=0 for dispositional format, ceiling is a hypothesis
7. "Fat Core will achieve 4/4" -- N=0, never tested
8. "Multi-coherence is computably achievable" -- programmatic gate checks channel COUNT, not channel COHERENCE

**Embarrassingly simple alternative (Report 16):** Opus + content + soul + "make this extraordinary." $5, 2 hours. If it works, the entire pipeline is unjustified. The meta-to-output ratio is at NaN:0 (infinite research, zero Flagship output). "The exit is building, not analyzing."

**Unasked questions (Report 16):** UQ-11 is paradigm-level: What if 4/4 is EMERGENT, not producible? What if it arises from an agent's native compositional capability meeting the right content at the right moment, and no recipe can systematically create the conditions? If true, the optimal investment is selecting the best model + the best content + minimal constraints, then running many attempts.

**Recipe ceiling thesis (Report 17):** Specification and composition compete for the SAME cognitive resource (builder attention). More specification = less composition. Three recipe types: Specification (ceiling 2.5/4), Procedural (3.0-3.5/4), Dispositional (unknown, possibly 4/4). "The recipe's job is not to contain the answer but to create the silence in which the builder can hear the question." The 230-line conventions brief is PROCEDURAL. A 30-50 line DISPOSITIONAL brief describing the builder's orientation and attitude is untested but potentially has a higher ceiling. Jazz analogy: lead sheet (constraints + vocabulary + content), not full score.

## PART 3: CROSS-CUTTING FINDINGS

### Finding F-01: The Recipe Paradox Is the Central Tension

The entire team's work circles a single paradox: MORE specification produces WORSE output. Reports 13 (compression), 14 (telescope/microscope), 17 (recipe ceiling), and 16 (unasked questions) all converge on this. The 134,800:1 compression ratio from research to CSS means that every additional line of instruction adds more interference than signal once you pass ~150 lines. The conventions brief at 230 lines is near this ceiling. The first experiment should test whether a 50-line DISPOSITIONAL variant outperforms it.

### Finding F-02: Content Is the Uncontrolled Confound

Every experiment used different content (Report 09). Content was NEVER controlled. The failed Flagship used content with ALL 7 negative properties (uniform register, no code, no questions, single domain). Successful experiments used content with 5-7 positive properties. Before investing in pipeline infrastructure, control for content. The next experiment should either use content with strong structural heterogeneity or deliberately test the same content through multiple approaches.

### Finding F-03: The Stack Is Operationally Complete

Reports 18-23 fully operationalize the 5-layer compositional intelligence stack. All layers now have: concrete CSS values, dependency chains, programmatic gates, and planning protocols. The conventions brief (Report 10) already encodes 72% of the stack. 4 targeted edits (+20 lines) would encode the remaining 28%. The stack model is COMPLETE as a specification. What remains is TESTING whether the specification produces the intended result.

### Finding F-04: The Conventions Brief IS the Pipeline

For Fat Core architecture, the ~230-line conventions brief (Report 10) IS the entire pipeline specification. Everything else is either reference material (tokens, components, catalog) or verification shell (gates, PA). The brief describes the world; the reference files provide vocabulary; the verification catches failures. There is no separate planning step, no inter-agent handoff, no build recipe. One agent reads content, reads the brief, and composes.

### Finding F-05: N=0 Is the Dominant Risk

Despite 22 reports, ~12,000 lines of analysis, and comprehensive theoretical framework, Flagship 4/4 has NEVER been produced. Every finding is a hypothesis. The project's meta-to-output ratio is at NaN:0 (infinite analysis, zero Flagship output). Reports 16 and 17 explicitly call for the project to STOP ANALYZING and BUILD. The single highest-leverage action is running Experiment E ($5, 2 hours) and observing what happens.

### Finding F-06: Layout Diversity Is the Hidden Lever

Report 19 reveals a finding that was not prominent in previous investigations: CD-006 achieves its multi-channel coherence (avg 3.4 channels/boundary) NOT through explicit per-boundary channel management but through LAYOUT DIVERSITY -- rotating grid patterns (Z-pattern, bento grid, 2-column, 3-column) guarantee that multiple CSS properties shift at boundaries as an emergent property of layout change. The Flagship attempt achieved the same channel COUNT (3.4) through PROPERTY MODULATION -- explicitly managing background, type, spacing at each boundary -- but this approach is fragile and requires constant vigilance. The conventions brief should emphasize layout diversity as the primary mechanism for achieving multi-coherence, not explicit channel counting.

### Finding F-07: Suppressor Chains Explain Non-Linear Quality

Report 05's suppressor chain analysis explains why the Flagship scored 1.5/4 despite containing more compositional intelligence than any prior experiment. The 14 suppressors form 4 cascading chains (A through D). Fixing one link in a chain does not break the chain -- the suppression cascades through the next link. The Remediation neutralized 7 of 14 suppressors and gained only +1.0 points (1.5 to 2.5). This suggests non-linear quality dynamics: quality may be multiplicatively suppressed (product of active suppressors), not additively (sum of active suppressors). Fat Core neutralizes 11 of 14 simultaneously, which -- if the multiplicative model holds -- could produce disproportionate quality gain.

### Finding F-08: The Builder Mode Question Is Testable

Report 17 identifies 4 builder cognitive modes: COMPOSING (produces 4/4), PLANNING-THEN-EXECUTING (produces 4/4), COMPLYING (produces 1.5/4), REPAIRING (produces 2.5/4). The conventions brief's format determines which mode the builder enters. A recipe ("do step 1, then step 2") triggers PLANNING-THEN-EXECUTING. A checklist ("verify X, verify Y") triggers COMPLYING. A world description ("here is the physics of this world; build inside it") aims to trigger COMPOSING. The $5 experiment can measure this: if the builder's build log shows compositional reasoning (metaphor derivation, transition planning, midpoint observation) the mode is COMPOSING. If it shows compliance checking ("verified container width, verified typography delta"), the mode is COMPLYING. Build log analysis is the cheapest test of the recipe ceiling hypothesis.

---

## PART 4: CONVERGENCE MAP -- Where Reports Agree and Disagree

### STRONG CONVERGENCE (18+ of 22 reports agree):
- Perception thresholds are non-negotiable (>=15 RGB, etc.)
- Opus unconditional for builders
- FORMAT > VOLUME (specificity > length)
- Container 940-960px is non-negotiable identity
- CD-006 is the best existing artifact but NOT Flagship tier

### MODERATE CONVERGENCE (12-17 of 22 reports agree):
- Fat Core architecture is the recommended approach
- Conventions brief over recipe format
- Multi-coherence is THE quality lever (3+ channels at boundaries)
- The anti-scale model (density x restraint x confidence) governs quality
- Content structural heterogeneity predicts PA-05

### CONTESTED (fewer than 12 agree, or active disagreement):
- Whether Flagship 4/4 exists as a discrete register (Report 11: may be continuous)
- Whether 230 lines is optimal or already too long (Report 17: 30-50 lines may be better)
- Whether Tier 5 questions measure perception or mechanism (Report 11: potentially circular)
- Whether the stack model is necessary or whether Opus achieves it natively (Reports 16, 17)
- Whether multi-coherence is computably achievable or only perceptually detectable (Report 20)

### UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS:
1. What does Flagship 4/4 actually look like? (N=0, never produced)
2. Does the register shift exist? (Testable with 2 PA-05 4/4 pages)
3. Is 4/4 emergent or producible? (UQ-11, paradigm-level, Report 16)
4. Does content or instruction format matter more? (Confounded in all experiments)
5. What is the optimal instruction length? (130-line interference threshold vs 230-line brief)

---

## PART 5: RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

**Priority: STOP ANALYZING, START BUILDING (Reports 16, 17)**

1. **IMMEDIATE: Run Experiment E** ($5, 2 hours). Opus + conventions brief (Report 10) + reference files + content. Mode 4 PA + Tier 5 questions. The decision tree from this one experiment resolves 80% of open questions.

2. **BEFORE Experiment E: Choose content wisely.** If using RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md, accept that its uniform academic register limits compositional variety (Report 09). Consider alternative content with code blocks, tables, procedural steps, and multiple rhetorical modes.

3. **AFTER Experiment E: Calibrate.** The first page scoring PA-05 >= 3.5 becomes calibration data. Adjust Tier 5 thresholds, Flagship gate elevations, and the 14-dimension definition based on what actual Flagship composition looks like.

4. **IF Experiment E >= 3.5 AND Tier 5 >= 6/8:** Conventions brief = the pipeline. Codify it. Skip all remaining infrastructure (TC narrowing, gate runner, orchestrator).

5. **IF Experiment E 3.0-3.5:** Test two alternatives: (a) Fat Core with verification shell (Experiment D), (b) Dispositional variant (~50 lines, Report 17). The recipe ceiling hypothesis predicts the brief's procedural format caps at 3.0-3.5/4.

6. **IF Experiment E < 3.0:** Debug the brief. Something in the 230 lines is creating interference, OR content selection was the problem, OR Flagship 4/4 genuinely requires infrastructure beyond a conventions brief.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The compositional intelligence corpus (~56 reports, ~40,000 lines) converges on a single thesis: **compositional intelligence is a property of the BUILDER under CONSTRAINTS, not a property of DOCUMENTS through PIPELINES.** The evidence is unambiguous: quality inversely correlates with agent count, input volume, and handoff boundaries. It directly correlates with builder autonomy, constraint clarity, and format density.

**CRITICAL FRAMING NOTE:** Flagship 4/4 has NEVER been achieved. The highest confirmed scores are CD-006 (39/40, Middle/Ceiling tier) and the Middle experiment (4/4, Middle tier). Both used medium-complexity content. Flagship-complexity content (12+ sections, multiple themes) has never been successfully handled by ANY configuration. The five producing conditions below are PREDICTIONS extrapolated from Middle/Ceiling successes and theoretical analysis -- not observations from achieved Flagship builds. Confidence is moderate (35-50% per the Master Synthesis contrarian-adjusted estimate).

Five conditions reliably PRODUCE quality at Middle tier and are PREDICTED to produce it at Flagship. Five conditions reliably DESTROY it. The format of intelligence matters more than its volume -- a finding confirmed across 13 independent reports.

---

## SECTION 1: THE FIVE CONDITIONS THAT PRODUCE QUALITY

### Condition P1: Single Opus Agent Plans AND Builds (Zero Creative Handoffs)

**What:** One Opus instance holds the full compositional arc from content reading through CSS output. No plan-to-builder boundary. No TC-to-recipe compression.

**Evidence chain:**
- CD-006 (1 Opus agent) = 39/40
- Middle (1 Opus builder, planner separate) = 4/4
- Remediation (1 Opus builder) = 2.5/4
- Flagship (Sonnet builders, 19 agents) = 1.5/4
- Report 103 (intelligence flow audit): 65% intelligence loss at plan-to-builder handoff
- Report 32 (master synthesis): "Quality inversely correlates with agent count AND builder input volume"

**Why it works:** Compositional intelligence exists in the RELATIONSHIP between planning decisions and CSS execution. When the same agent that discovers "deeper = denser = darker = heavier" writes `background: #F0EBE3`, it knows WHY that value. A separate builder re-derives the reasoning from hex codes -- and re-derivation is lossy (35-45% survival per Report 28).

**The finding behind the finding:** Report 27 (unasked questions) poses the deepest version: "Is compositional intelligence a system property or a builder property?" CD-006 proves it is primarily a BUILDER property. The pipeline's job is to create conditions for emergence, not to prescribe the outcome.

### Condition P2: Conventions Brief, Not Recipe (~100-250 lines of WHAT, Not HOW)

**What:** The builder receives proscriptive constraints (what NOT to violate) rather than prescriptive procedures (what TO DO step by step). The document tells the builder the outcomes it must achieve and trusts it with the method.

**Evidence chain:**
- Report 85 (recipe ceiling): Recipe ceiling at 3/4 for complex content. Convention ceiling at agent-native capability (3.5-4.0/4 for Opus).
- Report 85 two-dimensional model: HIGH SPECIFICITY + HIGH FREEDOM = untested Architecture D, predicted 3.0-3.5/4 first build.
- CD-006: convention-based (soul constraints + research context, no recipe) = 39/40
- Middle: 100-line recipe short enough to function as conventions = 4/4
- Remediation: 1,025-line spec (procedural) = 2.5/4
- Flagship: 530-line builder input (prescriptive checklist) = 1.5/4

**The 5-section structure (from Report 32):**
1. Perception Thresholds (20 lines) -- binary minimums
2. Soul Constraints (20 lines) -- absolute prohibitions
3. Spatial Rules (20 lines) -- layout requirements
4. Quality Floor (20 lines) -- mechanism minimums
5. Creative Authority (20 lines) -- explicit permission to override

**For Flagship specifically (from Report 29, fat-core extraction):** The conventions brief expands to ~200-250 lines by adding multi-coherence binding rules (~25 lines), fractal echo requirements (~20 lines), compositional memory protocol (~30 lines), and anti-patterns from the 1.5/4 failure (~15 lines). Still less than half the 650-line recipe.

### Condition P3: Explicit Creative Authority (The 3/4-to-4/4 Bridge)

**What:** The builder receives explicit, written permission to override any non-soul value, introduce novel mechanisms, and deviate from suggested patterns -- provided it logs overrides with compositional reasoning.

**Evidence chain:**
- Report 85: Identifies 4 irreducible capabilities beyond any recipe: content-form resonance, proportional intelligence, creative surprise, emergent coherence. All four require creative latitude to emerge.
- Report 84: "The 'DO NOT deviate' sentence is THE 3/4 ceiling. Removing it via the Creative Authority Clause is the highest-leverage edit for reaching 4/4."
- CD-006: Convention S9 allowed "crown jewel divergence" (overriding type-page to 3rem). The builder's creative choices produced 39/40.
- Report 29 (first principles): "Maximum intensity is maximum FOCUS, not maximum QUANTITY." Constraints that restrict creative judgment reduce intensity.
- Report 32: "The conventions brief does not try to encode [the 4 irreducible capabilities]. It provides the space for them to emerge by constraining only what would break the soul."

**The paradox:** Granting override permission makes compliance MORE likely, not less. The Prophylactic Paradox documented in memory: "permission to diverge prevents reckless divergence because the builder doesn't feel trapped." CD-006 had maximum creative freedom and zero soul violations.

### Condition P4: Perception Thresholds as Hard Floor (Binary Gates, Not Prose Advice)

**What:** Numerical minimums enforced programmatically that prevent the catastrophic failure mode (imperceptible styling). These are the ONLY constraints that need to be prescriptive.

**Evidence chain:**
- Flagship: backgrounds 1-8 RGB (imperceptible), typography uniform 16px/400 = 1.5/4
- Remediation: backgrounds >= 15 RGB (perceptible), typography zones present = 2.5/4
- Report 86 (intelligence hierarchy): L1 Perception Thresholds = the floor that prevents FLAT. Without it, L2-L5 are invisible.
- Report 83 (inherent vs bolted): PV2's thresholds are the ONLY layer fully encoded as binary gates. L2-L5 are text instructions.

**The exact values (from multiple converging reports):**
| Threshold | Value | Gate |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Background delta | >= 15 RGB between adjacent zones | SC-09 |
| Font-size delta | >= 2px between typographic zones | SC-11 |
| Letter-spacing delta | >= 0.03em between typographic zones | SC-14 (proposed) |
| Stacked gap max | <= 108px total at section boundary | SC-10 |
| Container width | 940-960px | SC-01 |
| Border presence | >= 1 structural border per 400px scroll | SC-15 (proposed) |
| Multi-coherence | >= 3 channels shift per zone boundary | SC-13 (proposed) |

**Why this is different from the recipe:** Thresholds are FLOORS, not CEILINGS. They prevent invisibility. They do not cap quality. A builder satisfying all thresholds can still produce 1.5/4 (technically visible but meaningless) or 4/4 (every visible choice serving the content). The distance between those outcomes is Conditions P1-P3.

### Condition P5: Self-Authored Compositional Artifacts (Transition Table + Fractal Echo)

**What:** The builder generates its OWN transition table and fractal echo table as planning tools before writing CSS. These are navigation instruments, not handoff documents.

**Evidence chain:**
- Report 83 (inherent stack): Transition table referenced in 9 of 11 source reports -- "the single most referenced new artifact."
- Report 84 (telescope+microscope): "The transition table is both telescope (semantic direction labels) and microscope (CSS delta values) in the same rows."
- Report 28 (propagation): "The transition table is NATURALLY both telescope and microscope."
- Report 14 (fractal stack trace): "TC produces fractal echo table but it DIES at handoff. Builder never sees it."
- Report 29 (fat-core extraction): For Fat Core, these artifacts become "SELF-AUTHORED rather than received from another agent... the agent can scroll up to its own transition table to verify the CSS it's writing matches the plan it made."

**Why self-authored matters:** When a separate planner produces the transition table, it is a SPECIFICATION the builder must follow. When the builder produces its own, it is a NAVIGATION TOOL it consults. The difference: specification constrains; navigation empowers. The builder's own table reflects its own compositional understanding, and checking it during the build prevents compositional drift during long (60-120 min) Flagship builds.

**The format (from Reports 83, 84):**
```
| Boundary | bg delta | font-size | font-weight | letter-spacing | border-left | channels |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| ->Z1     | ...      | ...       | ...         | ...           | ...         | n/a      |
| Z1->Z2   | ...      | ...       | ...         | ...           | ...         | >= 3?    |
```

## SECTION 2: THE FIVE CONDITIONS THAT DESTROY QUALITY (Anti-Conditions)

### Anti-Condition D1: Intelligence Compression at Handoff Boundaries

**What:** Compositional intelligence loses 35-65% of its content every time it crosses an agent boundary, measured cell-by-cell in Report 103.

**Evidence chain:**
- Report 103: 55-cell intelligence flow matrix, boundary-by-boundary audit. Boundary 3 (TC-to-builder) = 65% loss.
- Report 28 (propagation): 7 boundaries mapped. Total intelligence survival with prose format: ~35-45%.
- Report 32: "Intelligence cannot be compressed into documents and survive handoff between agents."
- Flagship: 19 agents, 4+ destructive boundaries = 1.5/4
- CD-006: 1 agent, 0 boundaries = 39/40

**Why it happens:** Each boundary requires FORMAT TRANSLATION. TC's 1,878 lines of cognitive analysis compress to a ~100-line build plan. That plan uses prose where CSS would be lossless (see D2). The builder re-derives CSS from mechanism NAMES rather than receiving mechanism CSS SNIPPETS. Every re-derivation is lossy.

**Implication for recipe:** The distance between plan and execution IS the compression. Fat Core eliminates this distance. The plan stays in the same context window as the execution.

### Anti-Condition D2: Prose Where Code Should Be (FORMAT > VOLUME)

**What:** The pipeline uses text descriptions to communicate CSS decisions. "Apply warm-cool-warm background arc" requires interpretation. `background: #fefcf3` is exact.

**Evidence chain:**
- Report 28 (propagation): The FORMAT > VOLUME finding, confirmed by 4/7 source reports in extraction Report 27.

**Format fidelity hierarchy (Report 28):**
| Format | Fidelity |
|--------|----------|
| CSS code | LOSSLESS |
| HTML structure | LOSSLESS |
| Structured data (YAML/JSON) | NEAR-LOSSLESS |
| Prose with inline code | MODERATELY LOSSY |
| Prose summary | HIGHLY LOSSY |
| Abstract instruction | CATASTROPHICALLY LOSSY |

- Middle builder got a RECIPE with specific CSS values = 4/4
- Flagship builder got a CHECKLIST with abstract constraints = 1.5/4
- Report 28 calculates: intelligence survival ~35-45% (prose path) vs ~75-85% (code path)
- Report 29 (fat-core extraction): "SPECIFICITY > LENGTH. 100 specific lines beat 963 abstract lines. The inverse-quality-with-input correlation is actually INVERSE-QUALITY-WITH-ABSTRACTION."

**Concrete meaning of FORMAT > VOLUME:** It does NOT mean "give the builder less." It means give the builder the SAME intelligence in a denser, more executable format. YAML data blocks + embedded CSS snippets carry ~2x the intelligence at ~30% less volume than prose descriptions.

**For the conventions brief:** Use YAML blocks for structured data (thresholds, multi-coherence rules). Use prose for principles (anti-scale model, creative authority). Do not use all-prose or all-YAML. Match format to intelligence type.

### Anti-Condition D3: Recipe As Cage (Sequential Prescription vs Compositional Freedom)

**What:** A long, prescriptive recipe fragments the builder's attention, pre-makes creative decisions, and caps quality at the recipe's own specificity level.

**Evidence chain:**
- Report 85 (recipe ceiling): "Recipes cap quality at their own specificity level." Convention briefs "allow quality to reach the agent's native capability."
- Report 85 two-dimensional model: Flagship (HIGH SPECIFICITY + LOW FREEDOM) = 1.5/4. CD-006 (LOW SPECIFICITY + HIGH FREEDOM) = 39/40.
- Report 84: "The builder's recipe is sequential steps... This is a FUNDAMENTAL tension" with convention-based composition.
- Report 29 (first principles): "Maximum intensity means maximum FOCUS, not maximum QUANTITY." The 650-line recipe is maximum quantity.
- Report 13 (anti-scale stack trace): "Recipe format INVERTS restraint (9 additive phases, no 'evaluate if you have enough')."

**The structural contradiction (Report 12):** The recipe is SEQUENTIAL BY CHANNEL (Phase 3 = backgrounds, Phase 4 = borders, Phase 5 = typography). Multi-coherence requires SIMULTANEOUS BY BOUNDARY (all channels shifting together at each boundary). These are incompatible organizational principles. Phase 3.5 mitigates but does not resolve.

**The three recipe types (Report 85):**
| Type | Ceiling | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| Checklist (what NOT to do) | 1.5/4 | "Verify X. Fail if Y." |
| Recipe (what TO do, in order) | 3/4-4/4 (variable) | "Phase N: Do X with Y." |
| Convention (what to ACHIEVE) | 4/4+ (agent-native) | "Every choice must serve the direction." |

### Anti-Condition D4: Volume-Induced Attention Fragmentation

**What:** More builder input = more constraints competing for attention = flatter output.

**Evidence chain:**
- Report 32: "Quality degrades monotonically with input volume."
  - CD-006 (~50 lines input) = 39/40
  - Middle (~100 lines) = 4/4
  - Remediation (~300 lines) = 2.5/4
  - Flagship (~530 lines) = 1.5/4
- Report 28 (propagation): "Context window competition means the builder cannot hold all 1,150 lines in active attention simultaneously. The RECIPE gets attention priority (it has action verbs). The MECHANISM CATALOG (richest compositional intelligence) gets lowest priority (it's reference material, not instructions)."
- Report 93 (separation of concerns): TC SKILL.md contains 624 lines (32.3%) of builder content -- context dilution degrades the planner's creative analysis.

**The attention budget model (from propagation reports):** Opus can actively attend to ~2,000-4,000 tokens at any moment. Total builder input must compete for this window. DENSER formats (structured data, CSS code) deliver more intelligence per token. SPARSER formats (prose descriptions) waste attention on syntactic sugar.

**The 230-line cap (Report 32):** Content brief (~30 lines) + conventions brief (~100 lines) + tokens.css (~65 lines) + prohibitions summary (~35 lines) = ~230 lines total active input. Reference files (mechanism catalog, components) consulted as-needed, not held in active attention.

### Anti-Condition D5: Guardrail Factory Without Playbook (7.9:1 Ratio)

**What:** The pipeline tells builders what NOT to do but almost never what TO DO. Prohibition without guidance produces compliance-shaped flatness.

**Evidence chain:**
- Report 67 (revised PV2 architecture): "963-line master prompt has 7.9:1 guardrail-to-playbook ratio in building sections."
- Flagship: Builder received maximally-prohibitive instructions. Produced maximally-compliant, maximally-flat output.
- Report 84: "The honest limitation: recipes ensure nothing is FORGOTTEN but cannot produce compositional DECISIONS."
- Report 13 (anti-scale): "Flagship spent 227 lines of CSS (22%) on sub-perceptual micro-typography (letter-spacing 0.001-0.01em). Prompt emphasis on 'refinement gradients' directed skill toward invisibility."
- Report 67: "Every guardrail needs a paired playbook with concrete CSS."

**The smoking gun:** The flagship builder allocated 22% of its CSS budget to imperceptible micro-typography because the prompt said "refinement gradients" without saying WHAT a good refinement gradient looks like. CD-006 spent those CSS lines on 11 components, 5 grids, 3 breakpoints. The difference: CD-006's builder knew what good CSS LOOKS LIKE (from research context); the flagship builder knew what bad CSS IS NOT (from guardrails).

---

## SECTION 3: FORMAT > VOLUME -- What It Means Concretely

### The Core Finding

"FORMAT > VOLUME" means: **the way intelligence is encoded determines how much survives to affect CSS, independent of how much intelligence you start with.** More text describing CSS decisions is LESS effective than less CSS expressing those decisions directly.

### The Six Intelligence Types (Report 28, Section 6)

| Type | What It Is | Best Format | Example |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Declarative | WHAT to do | YAML/JSON | `zone-1-bg: "#fefcf3"` |
| Procedural | HOW to do it | Sequenced recipe | "Phase 3: Apply backgrounds" |
| Visual | WHAT it looks like | CSS code | `background: #fefcf3;` |
| Compositional | WHY this combination | Prose + isomorphism | "Border-weight + zones encode DEPTH" |
| Perceptual | HOW it feels | Screenshots + PA | "Zone boundaries visible?" |
| Calibrational | WHEN to adjust | Thresholds + examples | "15 RGB for warm; 20+ for cold" |

**The pipeline's format error:** The 650-line recipe tries to propagate ALL SIX types in a SINGLE FORMAT (sequential prose). Prose is good for procedural and compositional intelligence but terrible for declarative and visual intelligence.

### What FORMAT > VOLUME Means for the Conventions Brief

1. **Perception thresholds:** YAML block (declarative intelligence). Not "backgrounds should differ by at least 15 RGB points" but:
```yaml
thresholds:
  background_delta: ">= 15 RGB"
  font_size_delta: ">= 2px"
  letter_spacing_delta: ">= 0.03em"
```

2. **Soul constraints:** Binary list (declarative). Not prose paragraphs but:
```
border-radius: 0 | box-shadow: none | no pure #000/#FFF | container: 940-960px
```

3. **Anti-scale model:** Prose (compositional intelligence). Cannot be YAML because it is evaluative:
```
Richness = semantic density x restraint x spatial confidence
density = mechanisms per zone (not total)
restraint = what you DIDN'T add
confidence = breathing room
```

4. **Creative authority:** Prose (compositional). Requires nuance about when to override vs when to comply.

5. **Anti-patterns:** Annotated CSS (visual intelligence). Not "avoid sub-perceptual typography" but:
```css
/* WRONG: letter-spacing: 0.003em (imperceptible) */
/* RIGHT: letter-spacing: 0.03em (visible) */
```

### Propagation Mechanisms That WORK (Cross-Report Convergence)

| Mechanism | Reports Confirming | Survival Rate |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| CSS snippets embedded in plan | 28, 84, 29 (extraction) | ~85% (near-lossless) |
| YAML structured data | 28, 15, 83, 87 | ~80% (schema-preserving) |
| BECAUSE clauses inline | 84, 17, 22 | ~70% (reasoning preserved) |
| Worked examples (CSS before/after) | 28, 84 | ~75% (executable) |
| Shared mental model (anti-scale 4-liner) | 28, 13 | ~65% (alignment without rules) |
| Template with required slots | 87 | ~90% (structural dependency) |
| Prose descriptions of CSS | 28, 93 | ~35-45% (lossy re-derivation) |
| Abstract instructions | 28, 29 | ~10-15% (catastrophic loss) |

### What COMPRESSES Intelligence vs PRESERVES It

**COMPRESSES (avoid):**
- Summarizing mechanism CSS as mechanism NAME ("deploy border-weight gradient")
- Replacing specific values with ranges ("15-25 RGB delta")
- Separating WHY from WHAT (build plan in one file, recipe in another)
- Funneling multi-dimensional analysis to single-word output ("metaphor: geological")
- Multi-file synthesis requirement (builder must cross-reference 6 documents)

**PRESERVES (use):**
- CSS-as-intelligence: embed adapted CSS snippets alongside decisions
- Inline integration: WHY + WHAT + verification at every instruction point
- YAML structure: machine-parseable, schema-preserving, unambiguous
- Self-authoring: builder generates its own planning artifacts rather than consuming others'
- Redundant encoding: same decision in CSS + YAML + 1-line reasoning (error-correcting)

---

## SECTION 4: HOW COMPOSITIONAL INTELLIGENCE REACHES THE BUILDER

### The Critical Question

In the Fat Core model, there is no handoff -- the builder IS the planner. So "how does intelligence reach the builder?" becomes "what EXTERNAL intelligence does the builder need?"

### The Three Layers of External Intelligence

**Layer A: Identity Constraints (unchanging, 100% survival needed)**
- Soul: `prohibitions.md` (~35 lines summary)
- Tokens: `tokens.css` (~65 lines)
- These are reference files. They change rarely. They travel as-is.
- Survival: ~100% (the builder reads them directly)

**Layer B: Perceptual Floor (binary, 100% survival needed)**
- Conventions brief perception thresholds section (~20 lines YAML)
- These are NUMBERS. Numbers survive compression perfectly.
- Survival: ~100% (numbers are unambiguous)

**Layer C: Compositional Context (the hard part)**
- Content understanding (from reading the markdown)
- Semantic direction (derived by the builder itself)
- Mechanism vocabulary (from mechanism-catalog.md, consulted as-needed)
- Component vocabulary (from merged-components.css, consulted as-needed)
- Research context (optional: 5-10 curated findings in conventions brief)

Layer C is where the Fat Core model WINS. In the linear pipeline, Layer C must cross the plan-to-builder boundary and loses 35-65%. In Fat Core, Layer C is generated and consumed by the SAME agent. Zero boundary. Zero compression.

### What the Builder STILL Needs Externally

Even in Fat Core, the builder needs:

1. **Content markdown** -- what to build
2. **Conventions brief** (~200-250 lines) -- what outcomes must be true
3. **tokens.css** -- exact token values
4. **prohibitions.md** -- soul constraints
5. **mechanism-catalog.md** -- deployment patterns (reference, not cover-to-cover)
6. **merged-components.css** -- component library (reference)

Total PRIMARY reading: ~450-500 lines (content + conventions + tokens + prohibitions summary).
Total REFERENCE material: ~1,800 lines (mechanism catalog + components, consulted as-needed).

This is LESS than Middle's successful configuration (~100 lines recipe + ~500 lines reference) but MORE structured. The conventions brief is ~2x Middle's recipe length but carries Flagship-specific sections (multi-coherence, fractal echo, memory protocol) that Middle didn't need.

---

## SECTION 5: THE 5-LAYER INTELLIGENCE HIERARCHY

### What Sits Above Perception Thresholds

Report 86 maps the complete hierarchy:

| Level | Name | What It Governs | PA-05 |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| L1 | Perception Thresholds | Can you SEE differences? | Prevents 1.5/4 |
| L2 | Scales (5 zoom levels) | Pattern visible at each zoom? | ~2/4 |
| L3 | Channels (6 CSS groups) | Pattern through multiple properties? | ~2.5/4 |
| L4 | Multi-Coherence (>=3 channels) | Channels reinforce same direction? | ~3/4 |
| L5 | Anti-Scale Model | Every decision serves governing principle? | 4/4 |

**Current state in PV2:** L1 = STRONG (binary gates). L2-L5 = ABSENT (text instructions that evaporate at handoff).

**For the conventions brief:** Each level needs representation:
- L1: YAML thresholds block (already designed)
- L2: Fractal echo table mandate (self-authored, ~15 lines of instruction)
- L3: Multi-coherence binding rules (~25 lines specifying 6 channels)
- L4: ">=3 channels shift at every boundary in same semantic direction" (already in L3 rules)
- L5: Anti-scale model 4-liner + restraint protocol ("When to STOP" + rejection log)

### The Anti-Scale Model: ZERO Operational Encoding

Report 13 traces the complete compression chain:
```
Anti-Scale Model (350 lines of evaluative framework)
  -> Memory (1 line: the formula)
    -> PV2 Architecture (0 mentions)
      -> TC SKILL (0 mentions)
        -> Build Plan (0 lines)
          -> Recipe (0 lines)
            -> Builder CSS (0 lines)
```

INFINITY:1 compression. The most important evaluative discovery has zero operational representation. The conventions brief MUST include the 4-line anti-scale model AND its three operational proxies:

1. **Semantic Density proxy:** "For each CSS property, can you name the content relationship? If not, REMOVE."
2. **Restraint proxy:** Mechanism rejection log (>=3 mechanisms NOT deployed with content-specific reasons)
3. **Spatial Confidence proxy:** Mass distribution check (no zone below 30% fill without deliberate spatial element)

---

## SECTION 6: CROSS-REPORT CONVERGENCE SIGNALS

### Strongest Signals (referenced in 5+ of 56 reports)

| Signal | Report Count | Key Insight |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Transition table as central artifact | 9/11 source reports, 6/7 in extraction | THE single most important new compositional artifact |
| Multi-coherence is THE quality lever | 5/7 extraction reports | Bridge from 3/4 (COMPOSED) to 4/4 (DESIGNED) |
| FORMAT > VOLUME | 13+ reports (4/7 extraction + 28, 29, 87, 83, 84, 85, 86, 93, 29-ext) | CSS-as-intelligence beats prose at 2x survival, 30% less volume |
| Recipe-plan merge eliminates compression | 4/7 extraction, 17, 28, 84, 93 | Middle (1 doc) = 4/4; Flagship (2 docs requiring merge) = 1.5/4 |
| Opus builder = non-negotiable | 5+ reports (29, 85, 32, 84, 21) | Opus creates beyond constraints; Sonnet complies within them |
| Anti-scale model absent from operations | 2 reports but HIGHEST severity (13, 86) | INFINITY:1 compression of governing principle |
| Fractal echo table evaporates at handoff | 2 reports but CONFIRMED by experiment (14, 83) | TC produces it; builder never sees it |
| Creative authority clause bridges 3/4-to-4/4 | 6+ reports (85, 84, 32, 29, 27, 87) | Permission to override = paradoxically higher compliance |

### Contested/Uncertain Findings

| Finding | Reports For | Reports Against | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Recipe is necessary | 85 (for simple content), 17 | 29, 27, 32 (conventions sufficient) | CONTESTED. Recipe may be scaffold OR cage depending on length and format |
| 42-line minimum viable pipeline | 27 (proposed) | 32 (230 lines minimum) | UNTESTED. The $5 experiment would resolve this |
| Pipeline adds value over single agent | 32 (verification shell) | 27, 31 (CD-006 proves single agent sufficient) | UNTESTED. Experiment A would resolve |
| YAML build plan better than prose | 28, 15, 83 | 29 (first principles: format may not matter for Opus) | LIKELY TRUE for linear pipeline, LESS RELEVANT for Fat Core |

---

## SECTION 7: SYNTHESIS -- THE RECIPE'S RELATIONSHIP TO THESE CONDITIONS

### What the Conventions Brief Must Encode

| Condition | How the Brief Encodes It | Lines |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------|
| P1 (single agent) | NOT in the brief -- architectural decision | 0 |
| P2 (conventions not recipe) | The brief IS this condition | ~200-250 |
| P3 (creative authority) | Section 7 of the brief | ~20 |
| P4 (perception thresholds) | Section 2 YAML block | ~20 |
| P5 (self-authored artifacts) | Sections mandating transition table + fractal echo | ~30 |
| D1-D5 avoidance | Implicit in the architecture (no handoffs, no prose-for-CSS, no recipe-as-cage, no volume overload, no guardrail-only) | 0 |

### What the Conventions Brief Must NOT Encode

From the anti-conditions and intelligence hierarchy analysis:

1. **Do NOT include mechanism catalog content.** The builder consults it as reference. Embedding it in the brief = volume inflation = D4.
2. **Do NOT include sequenced phases.** Phase ordering is D3 (recipe-as-cage). Instead, give a lightweight process section (~15 lines) with phases A-D (read/plan/build/verify).
3. **Do NOT include research findings.** Tempting but = volume. The builder's own content analysis replaces external research context. If needed, limit to 5-10 findings (~50 lines, optional).
4. **Do NOT include component library listings.** Reference file. Volume inflation.
5. **Do NOT include transition table template.** Mandate that the builder produce one; do not prescribe its exact format. Self-authoring > specification.

### The Information-Theoretic Minimum

Report 28 calculates: ~250-350 lines of structured YAML + embedded CSS is the practical minimum for carrying compositional intelligence from plan to execution. For Fat Core (where plan = execution), the minimum drops to ~200-250 lines of conventions brief + reference files consulted as-needed. This is:

- ~2.5x SMALLER than the 650-line recipe
- ~3x MORE INFORMATIONALLY DENSE (YAML + CSS vs prose)
- ~2x HIGHER FIDELITY (structured data survives; prose degrades)

## SECTION 8: THE BOTTOM LINE

### One Paragraph

Compositional intelligence reaches the builder by being IN the builder. The Fat Core model (one Opus agent plans and builds) eliminates the boundary where 65% of intelligence dies. External intelligence arrives as constraints (soul, thresholds) and vocabulary (tokens, mechanisms, components) -- not as instructions. The conventions brief provides WHAT outcomes + WHY principles in ~200-250 lines using the densest available format for each intelligence type (YAML for data, CSS for visual, prose for compositional, binary for thresholds). The builder self-authors its transition table and fractal echo table as navigation instruments. Quality emerges from the multiplicative relationship of semantic density, restraint, and spatial confidence -- the anti-scale model that currently has ZERO operational encoding. The recipe ceiling at 3/4 exists because recipes prescribe HOW, constraining the 4 irreducible capabilities (content-form resonance, proportional intelligence, creative surprise, emergent coherence) that can only emerge from an agent with explicit creative authority operating under clear constraints.

### Five Conditions That Produce 4/4

1. **P1:** Single Opus agent plans AND builds (zero creative handoffs)
2. **P2:** Conventions brief (~200-250 lines of WHAT), not recipe (~650 lines of HOW)
3. **P3:** Explicit creative authority with logging (the 3/4-to-4/4 bridge)
4. **P4:** Perception thresholds as binary gates (the floor that prevents 1.5/4)
5. **P5:** Self-authored transition table + fractal echo table (navigation, not specification)

### Five Anti-Conditions That Destroy Quality

1. **D1:** Intelligence compression at handoff boundaries (35-65% loss per boundary)
2. **D2:** Prose where code should be (FORMAT > VOLUME = 2x survival improvement)
3. **D3:** Recipe as cage (sequential prescription caps at 3/4)
4. **D4:** Volume-induced attention fragmentation (quality inversely correlates with input volume)
5. **D5:** Guardrail factory without playbook (7.9:1 prohibition-to-guidance ratio = compliant flatness)

# Flagship 4/4 DESIGNED: Measurable Definition

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Author:** flagship-definer agent (Opus)
**Evidence base:** CD-006 (39/40), Middle experiment (PA-05 4/4), Flagship experiment (PA-05 1.5/4), Remediation (PA-05 2.5/4), mechanism catalog (18), scale research, pipeline analysis corpus, compositional intelligence stack
**Consumed by:** All agents on flagship-44-recipe team

---

## 0. WHY THIS DOCUMENT

**CRITICAL HONESTY: Flagship 4/4 has NEVER been achieved.** No existing artifact demonstrates it. This definition is THEORETICAL -- derived from the compositional intelligence stack (scales, channels, multi-coherence, anti-scale model, fractal self-similarity) and from understanding what existing artifacts LACK. It is the best-informed extrapolation we can make, but it remains unvalidated until a page passes all gates.

**What we HAVE observed:**
- Middle experiment: PA-05 4/4 with 8-12 mechanisms, 350-500 CSS, 2 fractal scales. Vocabulary-fluent but "professionally stiff."
- CD-006: 39/40 score, 18 mechanisms, ~999 CSS, 5 fractal scales. Best existing artifact, probably Middle-to-Ceiling tier -- NOT Flagship. Built under CD-phase conditions (known content, Opus builder, accumulated 4-stage pipeline context) that are unreproducible.
- Flagship experiment: PA-05 1.5/4. Catastrophic failure despite strong intent.
- Remediation: PA-05 2.5/4. Partial recovery.

**What we have NOT observed:** A page where the full compositional intelligence stack operates simultaneously -- 5 scales, 6 channels, 3+ multi-coherence instances, structural metaphor driving CSS decisions, all perceptible without tooling. That is what "Flagship 4/4" means.

**The central problem:** Middle scored PA-05 4/4. CD-006 would likely score 4/4 on any PA. But neither exhibits full multi-channel coherence. Flagship 4/4 must be defined as a QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT mode of composition -- not just "more of what Middle does" but the compositional intelligence stack operating at full capacity. This definition makes that distinction concrete and measurable, even though no page has yet demonstrated it.

## 1. THE PA-05 SCALE (Anchored)

| Score | Name | One-Line | Distinguishing Feature |
|-------|------|----------|----------------------|
| 1/4 | DEFAULT | Browser defaults + basic CSS | No design decisions visible |
| 2/4 | STYLED | Consistent palette, type, spacing | Uniform template-quality |
| 3/4 | COMPOSED | Designed moments + zone differentiation | Atmosphere present but intermittent |
| 4/4 | DESIGNED | Every scroll position reveals intentional composition | Integrated atmosphere without gaps |

**The 4/4 score has TWO registers:**

| Register | What It Means | CSS Lines | Mechanisms | Scales | Multi-Coherence |
|----------|--------------|-----------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Middle 4/4** | Content-structure mapping: every mechanism serves a DIFFERENT content need independently. Professional, competent, vocabulary-fluent. | 350-500 | 8-12 | 2 (Page + Component) | 0-1 instances |
| **Flagship 4/4** | Metaphor-driven multi-channel coherence: multiple mechanisms encode the SAME semantic dimension simultaneously. Atmospheric, integrated, compositionally fluent. | 800-1500 | 14-18 | 5 (Navigation through Character) | 3+ instances |

**Middle 4/4 = the page has no undesigned moments.**
**Flagship 4/4 = the page has no undesigned moments AND every designed moment participates in an integrated atmosphere.**

The difference is COHERENCE. Middle deploys mechanisms independently (border-weight for hierarchy, zone backgrounds for section breaks, spacing for rhythm -- each solving a different problem). Flagship deploys mechanisms in concert (border-weight + zone backgrounds + spacing ALL encode the same thing -- "geological depth" or "refinement arc" or "confidence gradient" -- simultaneously through multiple CSS channels).

---

## 2. THE 14 DIMENSIONS (Binary Gates)

Each dimension has a THRESHOLD (binary pass/fail), MEASUREMENT METHOD, and EVIDENCE VALUES from the four reference artifacts.

### Tier Applicability Key

Each dimension is tagged:
- **[M+F]** = Required for BOTH Middle 4/4 and Flagship 4/4
- **[F-ONLY]** = Required ONLY for Flagship 4/4 (Middle can pass without it)

---

### D-01: MECHANISM COUNT AND CATEGORY COVERAGE [M+F, different thresholds]

Mechanisms are the 18 reusable CSS techniques from the catalog.

| Gate | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Total deployed (perceptible) | >= 8 | >= 14 |
| Spatial category (S) | >= 1 | >= 2 |
| Hierarchy category (H) | >= 1 | >= 2 |
| Component category (C) | >= 1 | >= 2 |
| Depth/Emphasis (D) | >= 1 | >= 2 |
| Structure/Navigation (N) | >= 1 | >= 2 |

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: 18/18 mechanisms, all 5 categories fully covered
- Middle: 12 mechanisms, all 5 categories covered (1+ each)
- Flagship 1.5: 14 claimed but ~5-7 perceptible (sub-perceptual CSS waste)
- Remediation 2.5: ~10-12 perceptible

**Measurement:** For each mechanism: (1) CSS rule exists, (2) rule applies to rendered element, (3) effect is perceptible without tooling. Only count if all 3 true.

---

### D-02: ZONE TRANSITIONS [M+F, different thresholds]

A zone transition is the boundary between major content sections. "Perceptible" = a reader scrolling at normal speed notices the change.

| Gate | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Total perceptible transitions | >= 3 | >= 8 |
| Channels changing per transition | >= 1 | >= 2 of 3 |

The 3 channels tested at each boundary:
1. **Background color** shifts by >= 15 RGB points on at least 1 channel
2. **Structural border** (>= 3px) appears or changes
3. **Typography** changes measurably (font-size >= 1px OR line-height >= 0.1 OR letter-spacing >= 0.5px)

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: 7 transitions, all perceptible, 2-3 channels each
- Middle: ~4-5 transitions, 1-2 channels each
- Flagship 1.5: 0 perceptible (1-8 RGB deltas, zero borders, zero typography changes)
- Remediation 2.5: 3-5 estimated perceptible

**Measurement:** Extract all `<section>` boundaries. Compute background RGB delta, border presence >= 3px, typography delta. Count channels >= threshold. Count transitions where enough channels change.

---

### D-03: CHANNELS ACTIVE PER BOUNDARY [F-ONLY]

The 6 independent CSS channels:
1. **Chromatic:** Background color change
2. **Typographic:** Font-size, line-height, or letter-spacing change
3. **Spatial:** Padding/margin compression or expansion
4. **Structural:** Border presence, weight, or color change
5. **Component:** Different component types appear
6. **Density:** Content-to-whitespace ratio changes

| Gate | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-------------|
| Minimum per boundary | >= 3 of 6 channels |
| Average across all boundaries | >= 4 channels |

**This is THE defining measurement of Flagship vs Middle.** Middle achieves zone transitions through 1-2 channels (typically background + component). Flagship achieves them through 3-6 simultaneous channels.

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: Average 4.3 channels/boundary (range 3-5)
- Middle: Average ~1.5 channels/boundary
- Flagship 1.5: Average ~0.5 channels/boundary
- Remediation 2.5: Average ~2-3 channels/boundary

**Measurement:** At each section boundary, check each of 6 channels for perceptible change above threshold. Count active channels per boundary. Compute average.

---

### D-04: MULTI-COHERENCE [F-ONLY]

Multi-coherence = multiple CSS channels encoding the SAME semantic concept simultaneously. This is what creates "atmosphere" -- the feeling that the whole page is "about" something.

| Gate | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-------------|
| Instances where >= 3 channels encode same concept | >= 3 |

**What a multi-coherence instance looks like:**

CD-006 geological strata (Section 1):
- Border-weight: 4px bedrock -> 3px subsoil -> 1px atmosphere (**Structural**)
- Spacing: generous padding at bedrock -> compressed at atmosphere (**Spatial**)
- Typography: Core Abstraction italic serif at bedrock -> regular prose at atmosphere (**Typographic**)
- Stratum label: mono uppercase gray (**Component**)
- All 4 channels encode ONE concept: geological depth/confidence

**Why Middle doesn't have this:** Middle uses border-weight for hierarchy, zone backgrounds for section breaks, spacing for rhythm -- each channel solves a DIFFERENT problem. There is no moment where 3+ channels encode the same concept.

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: ~5 instances (geological strata, header/footer bookend, Z-pattern Q&A, decision matrix, bridge transitions)
- Middle: 0-1 instances (header is the only candidate)
- Flagship 1.5: 0 instances (channels were independent when they encoded anything)
- Remediation 2.5: 1-2 instances (header strong; callout system has 2-channel coherence)

**Measurement:**
1. Identify semantic concepts in the page (importance hierarchy, zone type, confidence level, etc.)
2. For each concept, count CSS channels that independently encode it
3. A multi-coherence instance requires >= 3 channels encoding the same concept
4. Count instances

---

### D-05: FRACTAL SELF-SIMILARITY [M+F, different thresholds]

The same compositional pattern observable at multiple zoom levels.

| Scale | What to Check | Middle Gate | Flagship Gate |
|-------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| 1. Navigation | TOC/nav mirrors page density arc | NOT required | REQUIRED |
| 2. Page | Full scroll shows density arc | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| 3. Section | Individual sections have intro/body/close | NOT required | REQUIRED |
| 4. Component | 2-zone structure (label + body) | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| 5. Character | Inline font hierarchy | implicit (always present) | REQUIRED |

| Gate | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Scales with coherent pattern | >= 2 | All 5 |

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: 5/5 scales active. TOC has density labels, page has 4-act arc, sections have header meta + heading + body + closing component, components have 2-zone DNA, character has 4 font voices
- Middle: 2/5 (Page scale + Component scale)
- Flagship 1.5: 2/5 (Component + Character only)
- Remediation 2.5: 3-4/5

**Measurement:** Per-scale verification. Each scale is binary PASS/FAIL. The pattern at each level must ECHO the same structural principle (not just "general good CSS" at each level).

---

### D-06: SEMANTIC DENSITY [M+F]

No whitespace voids. Content fills every viewport.

| Gate | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Maximum consecutive blank space | <= 120px | <= 96px |
| Content-to-whitespace ratio per viewport (1440x900) | >= 35% | >= 40% |
| No viewport within `<main>` > X% blank | > 65% blank | > 60% blank |

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: Max gap ~80px (breathing transition). Content fills every viewport.
- Middle: Generally filled. Some sparse transitions but no voids.
- Flagship 1.5: CATASTROPHIC. 6 whitespace voids of 210-276px. 70-80% blank.
- Remediation 2.5: Improved to 33-175px gaps. S4-S5 at 175px total.

**Measurement:**
1. Full-page screenshot at 1440px width
2. Slice into 900px segments (100px step)
3. Compute % that is uniform background (no text, borders, components)
4. Flag violations

---

### D-07: PERCEPTIBILITY FLOOR [M+F]

Every compositional decision must be perceptible without tooling.

| Property | Minimum Delta | Applies To |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Adjacent zone backgrounds | >= 15 RGB points on >= 1 channel | Both |
| Font-size between zone groups | >= 2px cumulative | Flagship only |
| Letter-spacing (if used) | >= 0.5px (0.03em at 16px) or 0 | Both |
| Padding between zones | >= 24px difference | Flagship only |
| Border weight | >= 3px structural, >= 1px separator; NO 2px | Both |
| Container width | 940-1100px at 1440 viewport | Both |
| Section gap total (stacked) | <= 96px including margins + padding | Both |

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: All met. Distinct backgrounds, visible borders, clear typography.
- Middle: All met (within its simpler scope).
- Flagship 1.5: Catastrophic violations. 1-8 RGB backgrounds, zero borders, uniform 16px, 210-276px gaps.
- Remediation 2.5: Partially met. 2 transitions below 15 RGB. Typography converges.

**Measurement:** Automated extraction of computed styles at each section boundary. All binary.

---

### D-08: RESTRAINT INDICATORS [M+F, stricter for Flagship]

Flagship is maximum INTENTIONAL composition, not maximum complexity.

| Indicator | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Zero sub-perceptual CSS | Yes | Yes |
| Deliberate exclusion of >= 1 catalog mechanism | Not required | Required |
| No single component type > X% of instances | > 50% | > 35% (callout variants count separately) |
| Whitespace > 48px has structural content | Not required | Required |

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: High restraint. Drop cap 2x only. Solid offset sparingly. Core Abstraction 2x bookend. Scroll witness absent by design.
- Middle: Adequate restraint within simpler scope.
- Flagship 1.5: Zero restraint. 201 lines sub-perceptual CSS (22% budget).
- Remediation 2.5: Sub-perceptual eliminated. Callouts still dominant.

**Measurement:**
1. Scan for sub-perceptual values (font-size delta < 1px, letter-spacing < 0.01em, bg delta < 10 RGB)
2. Check maximum component-type repetition
3. Verify gaps > 48px have structural content
4. Verify >= 1 catalog mechanism absent by design

---

### D-09: AXIS PATTERN VARIETY [F-ONLY]

Multiple attention topologies creating compositional variety.

| Gate | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-------------|
| Distinct axis patterns used | >= 3 of 5 available |
| Named transitions between patterns | >= 1 per pattern change |

The 5 axis patterns: Z-Pattern, F-Pattern, Bento Grid, Spiral, Choreography.

**Each pattern must produce DISTINCT CSS output** -- different layout (grid/flex/linear), different component palette, different spacing rhythm. Labels without distinct CSS implementation do not count.

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: All 5 patterns used across 8 sections. 7 named transitions.
- Middle: 1 pattern (F-pattern) used throughout. No transitions.
- Flagship 1.5: Labels for multiple patterns but CSS uniform. Structural monotony.
- Remediation 2.5: Partial differentiation. Grid layouts in 3 sections.

**Middle does not need this.** Middle achieves 4/4 through content-structure mapping within a single pattern. Flagship uses pattern VARIETY as a compositional tool.

---

### D-10: DESIGNED MOMENTS PER SCROLL [M+F, different thresholds]

A "designed moment" = a viewport-sized region where at least one element goes BEYOND competent styling to exhibit intentional compositional craft (drop cap, inverted dark block, multi-column grid, pullquote, solid offset, data table with header backgrounds, etc.).

| Gate | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Coverage (segments with moment / total) | >= 75% | >= 90% |

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: ~100% coverage. Every viewport has at least one designed moment.
- Middle: ~80-85% coverage. Some transition viewports are plain.
- Flagship 1.5: ~15%. Header viewport only.
- Remediation 2.5: ~50-60%.

**Measurement:**
1. Full-page screenshot at 1440px
2. Slice into 900px segments (100px step)
3. For each segment: does at least one designed moment exist?
4. Coverage = segments with moment / total segments

---

### D-11: COMPONENT VARIETY [M+F, different thresholds]

| Gate | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Distinct component types | >= 5 | >= 8 |
| Max single type percentage | <= 50% | <= 35% (variants count separately) |

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: 11 types, 33 instances. Callout variants (5 types) prevent dominance.
- Middle: ~7-8 types. Adequate variety.
- Flagship 1.5: ~5 types effectively.
- Remediation 2.5: ~8-9 types.

---

### D-12: CSS QUANTITATIVE FEATURES [M+F, different thresholds]

| Metric | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| CSS lines (non-comment, non-blank) | 250-600 | 600-1500 |
| Distinct CSS selectors | >= 30 | >= 60 |
| Custom properties (:root) | >= 20 | >= 40 |
| @media breakpoints | >= 1 | >= 2 |
| Distinct background colors | >= 3 | >= 6 |
| Distinct font-size values | >= 4 | >= 5 |
| Distinct border-width values | >= 2 | >= 3 (1px, 3px, 4px) |
| Grid/flexbox layouts | >= 1 | >= 3 |

---

### D-13: METAPHOR PRESENCE [F-ONLY]

Flagship pages are driven by a STRUCTURAL metaphor that shapes compositional decisions. The metaphor is not just announced -- it manifests in CSS.

| Gate | Flagship 4/4 |
|------|-------------|
| Metaphor named in code comments or HTML | Yes |
| Metaphor creates at least 3 distinct class name families NOT in the mechanism catalog | Yes |
| Metaphor drives at least 2 multi-coherence instances (D-04) | Yes |
| At least 40% of sections show metaphor influence WITHOUT textual labeling | Yes |

**The 40% test:** Remove all textual annotations (comments, labels, section-meta). Can a reader still perceive the metaphor's organizational principle from CSS treatment alone?

**Evidence:**
- CD-006: Uses MULTIPLE local metaphors per section (geological strata in S1, Z-pattern Q&A in S2, bento in S3, etc.) rather than a SINGLE unified metaphor driving the whole page. This is sophisticated vocabulary fluency, not Flagship-level unified metaphor. The 70% structural-manifestation estimate is misleading -- each section manifests a DIFFERENT metaphor, not the SAME one.
- Flagship 1.5: "Assay laboratory" metaphor announced in comments but zero CSS manifestation. 12 per-section background variables differed by 1-8 RGB. Metaphor was textual, not structural. This is what FAILURE looks like on D-13.
- Remediation 2.5: Same assay metaphor. Some structural manifestation (zone typography variation) but metaphor perception requires labels. PARTIAL at best.
- Middle: No metaphor. Content-structure mapping only. This is fine for Middle.

**THEORETICAL NOTE:** No existing page demonstrates D-13 at Flagship level. CD-006 has local metaphors (Ceiling). The Flagship experiment had a global metaphor but zero CSS manifestation (failure). The question of whether a SINGLE unified metaphor can drive an entire page's CSS through multiple channels simultaneously has never been answered affirmatively. The 40% threshold and the 3-class-family threshold are best guesses based on what CD-006 achieves locally and what the tension-composition skill theorizes globally.

---

### D-14: ACCESSIBILITY BASELINE [M+F]

| Gate | Both Tiers |
|------|-----------|
| Skip link present | Yes |
| Focus-visible styles on all interactive elements | Yes |
| ARIA landmarks (header, main, nav, contentinfo) | Yes |
| Reduced motion media query | Yes |
| No color-only semantic signaling (border + color for callouts) | Yes |
| Heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3, no skips) | Yes |

---

## 3. SUMMARY SCORECARD

| Dim | Name | Middle 4/4 Threshold | Flagship 4/4 Threshold | CD-006 | Middle | Flagship 1.5 | Remed. 2.5 |
|-----|------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| D-01 | Mechanisms | >= 8, 1/cat | >= 14, 2/cat | 18/18 | 12 | ~5-7 eff. | ~10-12 |
| D-02 | Zone transitions | >= 3, 1 ch | >= 8, 2 ch | 7 (all) | ~4-5 | 0 | 3-5 |
| D-03 | Channels/boundary | N/A | >= 3 each, avg >= 4 | 4.3 avg | ~1.5 | ~0.5 | ~2-3 |
| D-04 | Multi-coherence | N/A | >= 3 instances | ~5 | 0-1 | 0 | 1-2 |
| D-05 | Fractal scales | >= 2 of 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 2/5 | 2/5 | 3-4/5 |
| D-06 | Semantic density | <= 120px, >= 35% | <= 96px, >= 40% | PASS | PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL |
| D-07 | Perceptibility floor | All met | All met (stricter) | PASS | PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL |
| D-08 | Restraint | Basic | Full (4 indicators) | PASS | PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL |

| D-11 | Component variety | >= 5 types | >= 8, <= 35% each | 11 | ~7-8 | ~5 | ~8-9 |
| D-12 | CSS features | Middle range | Flagship range | PASS | PASS | PARTIAL | PASS |
| D-13 | Metaphor | N/A | All 4 gates | PASS | N/A | FAIL | PARTIAL |
| D-14 | Accessibility | All 6 | All 6 | PASS | PASS | PARTIAL | PASS |

### Estimated Scores Against This Spec

**CAVEAT:** These are retroactive estimates. No page was built TARGETING these dimensions. CD-006 values are observed but achieved under unreproducible conditions (see Section 7). The Flagship column is THEORETICAL -- no page has passed it.

| Artifact | Tier | Middle Dims (of 10) | Flagship Dims (of 14) | PA-05 Score |
|----------|------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| CD-006 | Ceiling | 10/10 | ~10-11/14 (local MC, not global; no unified metaphor) | 4/4 (Ceiling register) |
| Middle | Middle | 10/10 | 3-4/14 | 4/4 (Middle register) |
| Flagship 1.5 | Failed | 2/10 | 0/14 | 1.5/4 |
| Remediation 2.5 | Partial | 5-6/10 | 2-3/14 | 2.5/4 |
| **Flagship target** | **Flagship** | **10/10** | **14/14** | **4/4 (Flagship register)** |

**Key distinction:** CD-006 achieves ~10-11 Flagship dimensions but its multi-coherence is LOCAL (concentrated in S1 and bookends) not GLOBAL (sustained throughout via a unified metaphor). Its D-04 score of ~5 instances is generous -- those instances are section-local, not page-spanning. Under strict Flagship interpretation (metaphor-driven global coherence), CD-006's D-04 and D-13 are PARTIAL, not PASS. This is why it is Ceiling, not Flagship.

---

## 4. THE SEVEN DIMENSIONS THAT MAKE FLAGSHIP DIFFERENT FROM MIDDLE

These are the dimensions where Middle 4/4 either does not apply or has substantially lower thresholds:

1. **D-03: Channels per boundary (>= 3 each, avg >= 4).** Middle gets 1-2 channels per transition. Flagship requires 3+ channels AT EVERY BOUNDARY with an average of 4. This is the single most discriminating measurement.

2. **D-04: Multi-coherence (>= 3 instances of 3+ channels encoding same concept).** Middle has zero multi-coherence. This is the QUALITATIVE difference -- mechanisms working together vs independently.

3. **D-05: Fractal depth (5/5 scales vs 2/5).** Middle operates at Page and Component scales. Flagship must echo its compositional pattern at Navigation, Section, and Character scales too.

4. **D-09: Axis variety (>= 3 distinct patterns).** Middle uses one pattern throughout. Flagship uses 3-5 patterns with named transitions between them.

5. **D-13: Metaphor presence (structural, not just textual).** Middle has no metaphor. Flagship has a metaphor that DRIVES CSS decisions and is perceivable without labels.

6. **D-01: Mechanism count (14 vs 8).** Not just more mechanisms but enough to cover 2+ per category, enabling multi-channel encoding.

7. **D-12: CSS scale (600-1500 lines vs 250-600).** The CSS budget to execute all the above requires substantially more code, but with zero sub-perceptual waste.

---

## 5. THE FORMULA

From scale research: `Richness = semantic density x restraint x spatial confidence`

**Middle 4/4:** High density (content fills viewports), adequate restraint (no waste), moderate spatial confidence (competent but cautious). Product: DESIGNED but "professionally stiff."

**Flagship 4/4:** High density (content fills viewports), visible restraint (deliberate exclusions, no sub-perceptual waste), high spatial confidence (bold borders, distinct zones, real typography variation, multi-column grids, width variation). Product: DESIGNED and atmospheric.

**Spatial confidence** is the hardest term to achieve. It means the builder's willingness to make BOLD, VISIBLE compositional decisions:
- 3px-4px borders that a reader SEES, not 1px borders everywhere
- Zone backgrounds that DIFFER by 15+ RGB, not by 3 RGB
- Typography that SHIFTS between zones (17px generous -> 15px compressed -> 16px settled), not uniform 16px
- Multi-column grids and bento layouts, not single-column throughout
- Width variation (80% pullquote, 85% table, 90% tension group), not 100% everything

**What suppresses spatial confidence:** Checklist-style instructions ("verify border exists"), guardrail-heavy prompts (7.9:1 guardrail-to-playbook ratio), emphasis on "refinement gradients" that directs CSS toward imperceptibility.

**What enables spatial confidence:** Recipe-style instructions ("deploy 3px primary border on section boundary, then set zone background to #FAF5ED"), reference screenshots showing what "perceptible transition" looks like, CSS value playbooks paired with every guardrail.

- Fail D-01, D-08, D-11, D-12, D-13 (mechanisms/restraint/components/CSS/metaphor): max 3.5/4

---

## 7. CD-006: BEST REFERENCE, BUT NOT FLAGSHIP

**CD-006 is NOT Flagship.** It is the best existing artifact (probably Ceiling tier), but it was built under unreproducible conditions:
- Opus builder with full 4-stage pipeline context (DD+OD+AD+CD)
- Known tutorial content ("Building Your First KortAI Page")
- Accumulated vocabulary from 30+ prior explorations
- Inter-agent messaging between planner and builder

CD-006 demonstrates that INDIVIDUAL Flagship thresholds are achievable in isolation:
- 18/18 mechanisms (D-01), 4.3 avg channels/boundary (D-03), ~5 multi-coherence instances (D-04), 5/5 fractal scales (D-05), ~100% designed moments (D-10), 5/5 axis patterns (D-09)

**But CD-006 does NOT demonstrate Flagship 4/4 because:**

1. **It was not built from a unified metaphor.** CD-006 uses geological strata in S1, Z-pattern Q&A in S2, bento in S3, etc. These are DIFFERENT organizational patterns applied section-by-section, not a single metaphor driving the entire page's CSS decisions through multiple channels simultaneously. The multi-coherence instances (geological strata, header bookend, etc.) are LOCAL, not GLOBAL. A Flagship page would have a single metaphor whose influence is felt at EVERY boundary.

2. **Its multi-coherence is concentrated at bookends.** S1 (geological strata) and S7-S8 (choreography + spiral) have strong multi-channel encoding. The middle sections (S3-S6) rely more on component switching than on coherent multi-channel transitions. A Flagship page would sustain multi-coherence THROUGHOUT, not just at bookends.

3. **Its channel coordination is incidental, not designed.** CD-006's 4.3 channels/boundary arose from accumulated craft, not from a deliberate compositional plan that said "at this boundary, chromatic + structural + spatial + typographic will all shift to encode the same thing." A Flagship builder would explicitly PLAN channel coordination at every boundary.

4. **It was built under conditions we cannot replicate.** No prompt produced it. It emerged from a sequence of exploration stages where each stage taught the builder more vocabulary. The Flagship challenge is producing comparable quality from a SINGLE prompt + recipe.

**What CD-006 tells us:** The CSS vocabulary exists to achieve Flagship thresholds. The mechanisms, the channel architecture, the fractal scale system -- all proven individually. What has NEVER been proven is that these can operate simultaneously from a single build pass with a single metaphor.

**This is the honest gap.** Flagship 4/4 is the theoretical state where ALL of the compositional intelligence stack operates at once. CD-006 proves the parts work. No page proves they work together under Flagship conditions.

## 8. WHAT THE FAILURES TEACH

### Flagship 1.5/4: The Sub-Perceptual Trap
- 14 mechanisms described but 0 perceptible
- 22% of CSS budget on letter-spacing 0.001-0.01em
- Background deltas of 1-8 RGB (needs >= 15)
- Zero borders at section boundaries
- 6 whitespace voids of 210-276px
- **Root cause:** Checklist instructions (what NOT to do) without recipe (what TO do). Guardrail:playbook ratio 7.9:1.

### Remediation 2.5/4: The Partial Recovery
- Sub-perceptual waste eliminated
- Callout system restored with 4 variants
- Grid layouts introduced (3 types)
- But: typography still uniform (15px not applied due to specificity), borders rendering uncertain, 2 transitions below 15 RGB
- **Root cause:** CSS-only remediation could not compensate for structural HTML monotony. Needed HTML restructuring + CSS.

### Middle 4/4: The Competence Ceiling
- 12 mechanisms deployed independently
- F-pattern throughout (no axis variety)
- 2 fractal scales only
- Zero multi-coherence
- But: every mechanism perceptible, every viewport had content, professional quality
- **Root cause:** Recipe-style instructions with specific CSS values. Builder knew WHAT TO DO, not just what not to do.

## 9. THE CORE INSIGHT

**Flagship 4/4 DESIGNED is not "Middle 4/4 with more stuff."**

It is a qualitatively different mode of composition:

| Property | Middle 4/4 | Flagship 4/4 |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Selection logic | Content feature -> mechanism | Metaphor -> shared semantic -> multiple mechanisms |
| Channel coordination | Independent (each solves different problem) | Coherent (3+ encode same concept) |
| Fractal depth | 2 scales (page + component) | 5 scales (navigation through character) |
| Spatial variety | Single axis pattern | 3-5 axis patterns with transitions |
| Metaphor | None (content-structure mapping) | Structural (drives CSS decisions) |
| Atmosphere | Professional but flat | Integrated and atmospheric |
| Builder input | 100-line recipe with CSS values | Recipe + metaphor + reference examples + playbooks |

The path from Middle 4/4 to Flagship 4/4 requires:
1. A metaphor that creates multi-coherence opportunities
2. Enough mechanisms (14+) to encode semantic dimensions through multiple channels
3. Enough section variety (3+ axis patterns) to create transitions
4. Enough scale depth (5 levels) to create fractal echo
5. Enough spatial confidence to make all of the above PERCEPTIBLE

## 10. THEORETICAL STATUS: WHAT IS PROVEN VS EXTRAPOLATED

This definition is honest about its epistemic status. Each threshold falls into one of three categories:

### PROVEN (observed in at least one artifact)

| Dimension | Where Proven | Confidence |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| D-01: >= 14 mechanisms | CD-006 achieved 18 | HIGH |
| D-05: 5/5 fractal scales | CD-006 demonstrated all 5 | HIGH |
| D-06: <= 96px gaps | CD-006 and Middle both pass | HIGH |
| D-07: Perceptibility floor (>= 15 RGB, etc.) | CD-006 passes all thresholds | HIGH |
| D-10: >= 90% designed moments | CD-006 achieves ~100% | HIGH |
| D-11: >= 8 component types | CD-006 has 11 | HIGH |
| D-12: CSS quantitative features | CD-006 passes all | HIGH |
| D-14: Accessibility | CD-006 and Middle both pass | HIGH |

### EXTRAPOLATED (derived from theory + partial observation)

| Dimension | Theoretical Basis | Observation Basis | Confidence |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| D-02: >= 8 perceptible transitions, 2+ channels each | Scale research (5 scales need 8+ boundaries to manifest) | CD-006 has 7 transitions at 2-3 channels. No page has 8 at 2+ channels each. | MEDIUM |
| D-03: >= 3 channels/boundary, avg >= 4 | Channel theory (6 channels exist; multi-coherence requires 3+ active) | CD-006 averages 4.3 but this was INCIDENTAL. No page has PLANNED this. | MEDIUM |
| D-08: All 4 restraint indicators | Anti-scale model (restraint is a multiplicative factor) | CD-006 shows restraint. No page was DESIGNED with explicit restraint gates. | MEDIUM |
| D-09: >= 3 distinct axis patterns | Axis research (5 patterns proven individually) | CD-006 uses all 5. No page has combined 3+ with NAMED transitions under Flagship conditions. | MEDIUM |

### THEORETICAL (derived from compositional intelligence stack, never observed)

| Dimension | Theoretical Basis | Why Unproven | Confidence |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| D-04: >= 3 multi-coherence instances (GLOBAL) | Multi-coherence theory: 3+ channels encoding same semantic dimension simultaneously | CD-006 has LOCAL multi-coherence (within sections) but not GLOBAL (unified metaphor driving all boundaries). No page has achieved global multi-coherence from a single build. | LOW-MEDIUM |
| D-13: Metaphor presence (structural, 40% without labels) | Tension-composition skill theory: metaphor should manifest structurally | Flagship experiment had a metaphor (assay laboratory) that produced ZERO structural manifestation. CD-006 had multiple LOCAL metaphors but no single unified one. The 40% threshold is a GUESS. | LOW |

### What This Means

The 8 PROVEN dimensions give us high confidence. If a page fails these, it fails -- we know what success looks like.

The 4 EXTRAPOLATED dimensions are well-grounded but have never been achieved under Flagship conditions (single prompt, single build pass). The thresholds are best estimates.

The 2 THEORETICAL dimensions (D-04 global multi-coherence, D-13 unified structural metaphor) are the CORE of what makes Flagship qualitatively different -- and they are the least proven. It is possible that:
- Global multi-coherence requires conditions we have not yet created
- The 40% structural metaphor threshold is too high (or too low)
- A unified metaphor under Flagship conditions produces unexpected interactions

**This definition will need revision after the first Flagship attempt.** The proven dimensions are firm. The theoretical dimensions are hypotheses to test.

**END DEFINITION**

*This document defines 14 binary dimensions with explicit thresholds. Any page can be verified against it. The key innovation over the previous 12-dimension spec (19-flagship-4x4-spec.md) is: (1) the explicit SEPARATION of Middle 4/4 and Flagship 4/4 thresholds, (2) the addition of D-13 (metaphor presence) and D-14 (accessibility), (3) the identification of the 7 dimensions that DISTINGUISH Flagship from Middle, (4) honest classification of CD-006 as Ceiling (not near-Flagship), and (5) transparent epistemic status for every threshold (proven/extrapolated/theoretical). Flagship 4/4 has never been achieved. This definition is our best theory of what it would look like.*

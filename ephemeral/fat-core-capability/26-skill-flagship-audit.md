# Skill Flagship Audit: TC (1,878 lines) and PA (774 lines)

## Executive Summary

Both skills are **Middle-tier instruments being asked to do Flagship work**. The TC skill's compositional intelligence peaks at Ceiling tier and treats Flagship as "Ceiling plus more passes." The PA skill's 48 questions cannot distinguish Middle 4/4 from Flagship 4/4 -- both would score identically on PA-05 if perceptual floors are met. Neither skill contains the compositional intelligence that separates Flagship from Ceiling: multi-coherence orchestration, channel-level composition, restraint-as-expression, and designed negative space.

The user's insight -- "Maybe the answer isn't adding more content but enriching to do what they're supposed to do well" -- is exactly right. Both skills contain the RIGHT categories but execute them at the WRONG depth for Flagship.

## PART 1: TC SKILL AUDIT (1,878 lines)

### 1.1 Where the TC Skill Tops Out

**The TC skill is a Ceiling-tier instrument.** Its entire architecture -- 6-phase pipeline from content assessment through metaphor collapse to compositional layout -- was designed for and validated at the Middle-to-Ceiling transition. Evidence:

**Phase 0D Tier Routing (lines 69-145):** Flagship is defined as "Full pipeline + multi-pass audit" -- the SAME pipeline as Ceiling, just run more times. This is the foundational misconception. Flagship is not Ceiling with more passes. Flagship is a qualitatively different compositional act requiring multi-pattern composition, designed negative space, and inter-mechanism dialogue that the pipeline has no phase for.

**Phase 4 Deployment Levels (lines 866-873):** The tier descriptions reveal the gap:
- Middle: "8-10 mechanisms, each independent, serving different content aspects"
- Ceiling: "12-15 mechanisms, 2+ combinations encoding shared semantics"
- Flagship: "16-18 mechanisms, 3+ patterns with BREATHING/SMOOTH/BRIDGE transitions"

Flagship is described as "more patterns with transitions" -- a quantitative escalation of the same logic. But CD-006 (39/40, the crown jewel) didn't succeed because it had MORE transitions. It succeeded because its mechanisms had CONVERSATIONS with each other -- border-weight shifts that anticipated typography changes two sections ahead, spacing rhythms that created counterpoint with background zone shifts. The TC skill has no concept of mechanism dialogue.

**Phase 4.7 Fractal Consistency Gate (lines 1416-1461):** The fractal gate requires pattern self-similarity at multiple scales, which is correct. But for Flagship it requires 5 scales with "SAME pattern direction at each scale." This is precisely wrong for Flagship. CD-006's sophistication came from VARIATION between scales -- the page-level pattern was PULSE (rhythmic dense-sparse), but the component-level pattern was CRESCENDO (building within each component). The fractal consistency gate as written would REJECT CD-006's approach.

### 1.2 Where the TC Skill Compresses Compositional Intelligence

**Compression Point 1: Metaphor = Single Domain (Phase 3)**
The entire metaphor derivation assumes ONE domain bridge. Flagship compositions often operate with blended metaphors -- CD-006's pilot migration page blended cartographic (zone mapping) with editorial (typographic hierarchy as authority) with architectural (load-bearing structural elements). The TC skill's Phase 3 forces selection of A SINGLE winner. A Flagship-first TC skill would support metaphor BLENDING -- deriving 2-3 compatible domains and composing their structural properties.

**Compression Point 2: Mechanisms as Independent Units (Phase 4.1-4.2)**
The 5-category taxonomy (Spatial/Temporal/Material/Behavioral/Relational) and the translation grammar treat mechanisms as independent CSS deployments. Each mechanism gets one sentence of justification (line 1094-1096). For Flagship, mechanisms are not independent -- they are VOICES in a composition. Border-weight (#1) and zone backgrounds (#7) must be orchestrated together so that a 4px border at a zone boundary WHERE the background shifts from #FEF9F5 to #F0EBE3 creates a different perceptual effect than the same 4px border without the background shift. The skill has no concept of mechanism INTERACTION -- only mechanism INVENTORY.

**Compression Point 3: Coherence as Parallel Consistency (Phase 4.3)**
The 5 coherence rules (C-1 through C-5) check that all channels reinforce the SAME direction. This is Middle-tier coherence (everything moves together). Flagship coherence is MULTI-COHERENCE: some channels move in counterpoint while still serving the same metaphor. For example, in CD-006, typography SIMPLIFIED while backgrounds COMPLEXIFIED across a boundary -- the contrast between the channels WAS the design moment. The TC skill's C-1 ("Density direction must be consistent across ALL channels") would flag this as a coherence violation.

**Compression Point 4: Transitions as 3-Type Taxonomy (Phase 4.6)**
SMOOTH/BRIDGE/BREATHING is the entire transition vocabulary. Flagship pages need at least 5-6 transition types: SMOOTH, BRIDGE, BREATHING, CONTRAST (deliberate reversal of direction), ECHO (subtle callback to earlier treatment), and DISSOLVE (gradual multi-channel shift over 2-3 elements rather than at a single boundary). The 3-type taxonomy is sufficient for Middle, limiting for Ceiling, and crippling for Flagship.

**Compression Point 5: No Phase for Designed Negative Space**
The skill treats negative space as a GUARDRAIL concern (max breathing zone 48px, PA-09 catches dead zones). For Flagship, negative space is a COMPOSITIONAL TOOL -- silence in the musical sense. Where you place 80px of breathing space, what the background color is during that breath, whether the preceding section ended with compression or expansion -- these are design decisions. The TC skill has no phase, gate, or protocol for designing negative space.

**Compression Point 6: Scale-Channel Invocation is Absent**
The skill mentions "channels" (the 6 CSS channels in Phase 4.2, line 1249-1260) but never teaches how to compose ACROSS channels at different SCALES. Flagship composition requires: "At the page scale, background and spacing carry the metaphor. At the section scale, border-weight and typography carry it. At the component scale, spacing and color carry it." This channel-per-scale allocation is the core Flagship compositional act, and the TC skill has no concept of it.

### 1.3 What a Flagship-First TC Skill Would Emphasize Differently

**A. Replace Single Metaphor with Metaphor Blend Protocol**
Phase 3 should support 1-3 compatible domains. Score each domain independently, then score their BLEND -- do the domains' structural properties create productive interference (different channels activated at different scales) or destructive interference (same channels competing at same scale)?

**B. Add Phase 3.7: Channel Allocation Plan**
After metaphor commitment, explicitly map which CSS channels carry which metaphor domains at which scales. This is the core Flagship planning document:

```
PAGE SCALE:      background + spacing    → [domain A: cartographic zones]
SECTION SCALE:   border + typography     → [domain B: editorial authority]
COMPONENT SCALE: spacing + color accent  → [domain C: architectural load]
```

**C. Replace Coherence Rules with Multi-Coherence Protocol**
Instead of "all channels must move in same direction" (C-1), introduce:
- PARALLEL coherence: channels reinforce (current C-1, appropriate for Middle)
- COUNTERPOINT coherence: channels diverge intentionally to create tension at boundary
- ECHO coherence: channel pattern from earlier section returns at later section, different scale
- DISSOLUTION coherence: channel gradually shifts over 2-3 elements instead of at sharp boundary

**D. Add Phase 4.5B: Negative Space Composition**
Treat negative space as designed elements, not gaps between designed elements:
- What is the background treatment during each breathing zone?
- Does the negative space width VARY (musical rest vs fermata vs caesura)?
- Does the negative space create anticipation for what follows?

**E. Expand Transition Taxonomy to 6+ Types**
Add CONTRAST, ECHO, and DISSOLVE to the existing SMOOTH/BRIDGE/BREATHING.

**F. Add Mechanism Interaction Matrix**
For each pair of mechanisms deployed in proximity, document the INTERACTION:
- Reinforcing (both encode same semantic)
- Counterpoint (encode different aspects of same moment)
- Independent (no interaction, both serve different content aspects)
- Conflicting (fight each other -- must be resolved)

### 1.4 TC Skill Flagship Verdict

| Dimension | Current State | Flagship Need | Gap |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Metaphor derivation | Single domain | 1-3 blended domains | LARGE |
| Mechanism deployment | Independent inventory | Interacting voices | LARGE |
| Coherence model | Parallel only | Multi-coherence (4 modes) | LARGE |
| Transition vocabulary | 3 types | 6+ types | MODERATE |
| Negative space | Guardrail (avoid voids) | Compositional tool | LARGE |
| Channel-scale allocation | Absent | Core planning document | CRITICAL |
| Fractal gate | Same direction at all scales | Variation between scales | MODERATE |
| Perceptual risk gates | Present and strong | Sufficient | NONE |
| Builder warnings | Present and strong | Sufficient | NONE |

**Bottom line:** The TC skill is excellent at Middle-to-Ceiling. For Flagship, it needs enrichment in 6 areas, with channel-scale allocation being the most critical addition. The skill's STRUCTURE (6-phase pipeline) is sound -- Flagship enrichment would modify existing phases, not add new ones.

## PART 2: PA SKILL AUDIT (774 lines)

### 2.1 Can PA-05 Distinguish Middle 4/4 from Flagship 4/4?

**No.** PA-05's four sub-criteria are:

1. **DESIGNED:** "Does this feel like intentional composition, or assembled components?"
2. **COHERENT:** "Does this feel like one designer made it?"
3. **PROPORTIONATE:** "Does the spatial balance feel considered?"
4. **POLISHED:** "Is execution quality high?"

The Middle experiment PASSED all four. A Middle page with 12 mechanisms across 5 categories, good spatial balance, and high execution quality legitimately earns 4/4. But a Flagship page with multi-coherence, channel-scale composition, metaphor-blend architecture, and designed negative space ALSO earns 4/4 on these same criteria. PA-05 has no way to distinguish between "good mechanism deployment" (Middle 4/4) and "compositional mastery" (Flagship 4/4).

**The problem is definitional:** PA-05 measures whether something crosses the "designed" threshold. It does not measure HOW MUCH design sophistication is present above that threshold. A Middle page at 4/4 is like a B+ essay -- competent, well-structured, meets all criteria. A Flagship page at 4/4 should be like an A+ essay -- but PA-05 gives them the same score.

### 2.2 What Flagship-Specific Detection is Missing from the 48 Questions?

**Missing Detection 1: Multi-Coherence**
No question asks: "Do any sections create DELIBERATE contrast where multiple visual properties shift in different directions simultaneously -- and does that contrast feel designed or accidental?" Current PA-03 ("Does this feel like one designer or three?") catches incoherence but cannot distinguish between accidental fragmentation and designed counterpoint.

**Missing Detection 2: Channel Composition**
No question asks: "Can you identify different visual 'instruments' (color, weight, spacing, typography) playing different roles, like parts of an orchestra? Or does everything move together uniformly?" Current PA-17 (rhythm) catches monotony but not the ABSENCE of multi-channel composition.

**Missing Detection 3: Scale Coverage**
No question asks: "Zoom in to a single component, then zoom out to the full page. Do you see the SAME design sensibility expressed differently at each scale? Or does the design 'live' at only one zoom level?" Current PA-10 (squint test) checks macro balance. PA-38 checks internal container hierarchy. But neither bridges the scales.

**Missing Detection 4: Negative Space Quality Beyond Voids**
PA-33 asks: "Pick the largest area of empty space. Does it feel like silence in music or a dropped signal?" This is excellent for catching voids but insufficient for Flagship. Flagship negative space assessment needs: "Is the empty space VARIED -- different sizes, different background treatments, different purposes? Or is all negative space treated identically?" Current PA-33 assesses ONE area; Flagship needs assessment of the SYSTEM of negative spaces.

**Missing Detection 5: Mechanism Interaction**
No question asks: "Can you find a place where TWO visual treatments overlap or meet -- and does their combination create a moment that neither would create alone?" This is the signature of Flagship composition. When border-weight shifts at the exact boundary where background color shifts AND typography scale changes, that triple coincidence creates a designed moment that is perceptible but not measurable by any individual PA question.

**Missing Detection 6: Compositional Ambition**
PA-45 asks: "Is there a single moment on this page that you would show someone as an example of good design?" This is close but not sufficient. Flagship detection needs: "How many DISTINCT design moments exist on this page? Not repeated patterns, but unique visual events where the treatment does something it hasn't done before?" A Middle page might have 1-2 design moments (the hero, maybe one callout). A Flagship page should have 5-8, distributed across the full scroll depth.

**Missing Detection 7: Restraint as Expression**
No question asks: "Are there places where the design is DELIBERATELY simple -- not because the designer ran out of ideas, but because the simplicity creates contrast with surrounding richness?" Flagship pages use restraint as an active compositional choice. Current PA questions can catch "too sparse" (PA-09) and "too busy" (PA-37) but cannot detect DESIGNED simplicity vs default simplicity.

### 2.3 Do the Tier 4 Void Prevention Questions (PA-50 through PA-53) Help?

Yes, significantly -- but they are FLOOR questions, not CEILING questions. They catch catastrophic failure (the Ceiling experiment's whitespace void) but don't detect Flagship excellence. PA-50 (consecutive blank viewports), PA-51 (content-to-scroll ratio), PA-52 (visual weight per third), PA-53 (width utilization) are all binary pass/fail thresholds. A Middle page and a Flagship page both PASS these. The questions prevent the Ceiling experiment's failure but don't detect the Flagship experiment's ambition.

### 2.4 Should There Be a PA-06 for Flagship?

**Yes, but not as a single question -- as a TIER 5 question set.** PA-05's 4 sub-criteria measure the "designed" threshold. A Tier 5 set would measure compositional sophistication ABOVE that threshold. Proposed:

**Tier 5: Compositional Depth (Flagship Only)**

| ID | Question | What It Detects |
|----|----------|-----------------|
| **PA-60** | Can you identify at least 3 distinct "design moments" -- places where the visual treatment does something unique that it doesn't repeat elsewhere on the page? Point to each. | Design moment density, compositional ambition |
| **PA-61** | Do different visual properties (weight, color, spacing, type) seem to have their own independent rhythms, or does everything shift at the same time? | Multi-coherence vs uniform coherence |
| **PA-62** | Find a section transition. Count how many visual properties change simultaneously. Is the result dramatic (3+ shifts = designed moment) or quiet (1 shift = continuation)? Are there BOTH kinds? | Transition sophistication, variation in transition intensity |
| **PA-63** | Zoom into one component. Does its internal design mirror the page's overall design language but at a smaller scale? Then zoom back out -- is that relationship deliberate? | Fractal coherence across scales |
| **PA-64** | Is there any section that is DELIBERATELY plain -- simpler than surrounding sections in a way that makes the surrounding richness more noticeable? | Restraint as expression, compositional contrast |
| **PA-65** | If this page were a piece of music, would it be: (a) a single instrument playing one melody, (b) a choir singing in unison, (c) an ensemble with different parts? | Multi-voice composition detection |
| **PA-66** | Look at the empty spaces between sections. Are they all the same "flavor" of emptiness, or do different gaps feel different from each other? | Negative space as composition, not just gap |
| **PA-67** | Does the page feel like it's doing something you haven't seen before -- not just well-executed, but inventive? What specifically is novel? | Novelty beyond competence |

**Scoring for Flagship PA-05+:**
- PA-05 standard 4/4 (DESIGNED threshold) = baseline
- PA-60 through PA-67: Score each YES/NO
- 6-8 YES = Flagship COMPOSED (the score above DESIGNED)
- 4-5 YES = Flagship SOPHISTICATED (approaching but not achieving full composition)
- 0-3 YES = NOT Flagship (may be excellent Middle or Ceiling, but not Flagship-tier)

### 2.5 PA Skill Flagship Verdict

| Dimension | Current State | Flagship Need | Gap |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Void prevention | Excellent (Tier 4 PA-50 to PA-53) | Sufficient | NONE |
| Design threshold | Good (PA-05 4 sub-criteria) | Sufficient as BASELINE | NONE |
| Multi-coherence detection | Absent | Tier 5 questions needed | CRITICAL |
| Channel composition detection | Absent | Tier 5 questions needed | CRITICAL |
| Scale coverage detection | Partial (PA-10 + PA-38) | Needs bridging question | MODERATE |
| Negative space quality | Partial (PA-33, one area) | Needs system-level assessment | MODERATE |
| Mechanism interaction | Absent | Tier 5 questions needed | CRITICAL |
| Restraint-as-expression | Absent | Tier 5 questions needed | LARGE |
| Design moment density | Partial (PA-45, one moment) | Needs count + distribution | MODERATE |
| Metaphor assessment | Present (PA-42 to PA-44) | Sufficient | NONE |

**Bottom line:** The PA skill is excellent at catching failures (voids, monotony, readability problems) and measuring the "designed" threshold. It cannot measure compositional depth ABOVE that threshold. For Flagship, it needs a Tier 5 question set (8 questions) focused on multi-coherence, channel composition, scale coverage, and restraint-as-expression.

## PART 3: CROSS-SKILL ALIGNMENT

### 3.1 The Fundamental Mismatch

The TC skill produces compositions but cannot guide toward Flagship-level multi-coherence. The PA skill audits compositions but cannot detect Flagship-level multi-coherence. The gap is SYMMETRICAL -- neither skill has the concept.

This means:
1. TC produces a composition that tops out at Ceiling complexity
2. PA audits it and reports 4/4 (because the "designed" threshold is met)
3. The page is genuinely good but not Flagship-tier
4. Nobody in the pipeline knows something is missing

This is exactly what happened in the Flagship experiment: the pipeline produced output that passed programmatic gates (TC's coherence checks) but failed perceptual audit on RICHNESS -- which PA-05 couldn't distinguish from a slightly-less-polished Middle page.

### 3.2 What Enrichment Would Fix

The user's insight is precisely correct: **enriching what exists to do what it's supposed to do well** is the answer. Specifically:

**TC enrichment targets (6 modifications to existing phases):**
1. Phase 3: Support metaphor blending (modify, not add)
2. Phase 3.7: Add channel-scale allocation plan (new sub-phase in existing structure)
3. Phase 4.3: Replace single-direction coherence with multi-coherence modes (modify)
4. Phase 4.6: Expand transition taxonomy from 3 to 6 types (modify)
5. Phase 4.5B: Add negative space composition (new sub-phase)
6. Phase 4.7: Allow fractal VARIATION, not just fractal CONSISTENCY (modify)

**PA enrichment targets (1 new tier):**
1. Tier 5: 8 questions for Flagship compositional depth detection (new tier)

**Estimated enrichment scope:**
- TC: ~200-300 lines of modifications/additions across existing phases
- PA: ~80-100 lines for Tier 5 question set + scoring guidance
- Total: ~280-400 lines of enrichment, not rewrite

### 3.3 What NOT to Change

Both skills have strong foundations that should be preserved:

**TC preserves:**
- 6-phase pipeline structure (sound architecture)
- Per-category mechanism deployment (validated at Middle, extrapolates to Flagship)
- Perceptual risk and cost assessments (critical safety gates)
- Builder warnings (proven failure prevention)
- Library access prohibition during derivation (protects originality)
- 6 binary rejection checks for metaphors (catches structural problems early)
- Metaphor quality rubric with interpretive distance gate (prevents literal metaphors)

**PA preserves:**
- Fresh-eyes principle (non-negotiable)
- 4-mode structure (embedded/quick/standard/standalone)
- Cold Look protocol (the single most important auditing innovation)
- Information isolation between agents (prevents contamination)
- Dual severity track (perception vs rule)
- Void prevention questions (Tier 4)
- Language hard block on CSS vocabulary for auditors
- Metaphor-awareness principles (correctly separates concept from execution)

---

## PART 4: THE ENRICHMENT HYPOTHESIS

**Hypothesis:** If TC Phase 3 supports metaphor blending + TC Phase 4.3 supports multi-coherence + PA Tier 5 detects compositional depth, then:
- TC will GUIDE builders toward Flagship-level composition
- PA will DETECT whether builders achieved it
- The symmetric gap closes on both sides

**Predicted outcome:** Flagship pages score 4/4 on PA-05 (baseline, same as Middle) PLUS 6-8/8 on PA Tier 5 (compositional depth). The two scores together distinguish Middle-excellent from Flagship-composed.

**Risk:** Adding multi-coherence to TC and Tier 5 to PA adds complexity that could hurt Middle-tier performance if builders try to apply Flagship techniques at Middle tier. Mitigation: all enrichments must be GATED behind tier classification (Step 0D). Middle builders never see multi-coherence guidance. Flagship builders see it as primary instruction.

**Cost-benefit:** ~300 lines of enrichment (not 1,000 lines of new skill) to close the gap between "can produce Middle 4/4 reliably" and "can produce Flagship COMPOSED." High leverage, contained scope, modifies existing structure.

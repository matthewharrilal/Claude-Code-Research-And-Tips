#### DD-002 "Gradient" (Score: 35/40)
**Generative Question (Header):** "Can documentation pages use a CRESCENDO density model -- starting sparse and progressively tightening -- without sacrificing readability or soul compliance? Does gradual density increase improve onboarding and progressive learning experiences?"

**In-Body Hypothesis:** "Information density should build gradually from sparse to dense (CRESCENDO pattern), creating natural onboarding that respects cognitive load."

**Pattern/Type:** CRESCENDO (progressive density increase)

**Research Source:** R3-004 (CRESCENDO), R3-012

**DD Source:** DD-001 lessons applied (standardized borders, no traffic-light)

---

#### CD-005 "Multi-Axis Transition"
**Formal Question:** "Can 3 axis patterns coexist sequentially on a single page with proper transition grammar (AD-F-025), where each section commits to ONE pattern (AD-F-024), WAVE density oscillates between MEDIUM/HIGH/MEDIUM-HIGH, and transitions use SMOOTH and BRIDGE types to maintain reading flow?"

## SECTION 2: QUESTION EVOLUTION BY STAGE (DD → OD → AD → CD)

### Stage-by-Stage Transformation Pattern

#### DD (Density Dimensions): PHENOMENOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
**Canonical form:** "Can [nature metaphor] work as [density strategy] under [constraints]?"

**Question characteristics:**
- POETIC and INTUITIVE
- Start from metaphor, test against constraints
- Open-ended: invite exploration
- Grounded in visual/physical analogy
- Reference specific research (R3-003, R3-047, R3-036)
- 6 questions total: PULSE, CRESCENDO, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, TIDAL, FRACTAL

**Example evolution:**
- DD-001: "How does PULSE perform as a density strategy?" (basic validation)
- DD-002: "Can CRESCENDO work without sacrificing readability?" (adds reader concern)
- DD-006: "Can density be self-similar at 4 scales?" (adds structural complexity)

**Key property:** Each DD builds implicit lessons for the next DD. DD-001's "standardized borders, no traffic-light" becomes a constraint for DD-002 and beyond.

---

#### OD (Organizational Dimensions): STRUCTURAL HYPOTHESIS QUESTIONS
**Canonical form:** "What if documentation was organized as [cognitive structure] -- does this naturally create [DD density pattern]?"

**Question characteristics:**
- DESIGN THINKING formulation ("What if...?")
- Explicitly PAIR organizational structure with DD density patterns
- Make testable, falsifiable claims
- References both DD and OD research findings
- OD-001 through OD-005: specific organizational approaches
- OD-006: META-QUESTION about relationship between organization and density

**Example evolution:**
- OD-001: "What if docs were conversational? Would PULSE emerge naturally?" (foundational pairing)
- OD-002: "What if docs were narrative arc? Would CRESCENDO emerge?" (parallel exploration)
- OD-006: "Are organization and density the SAME phenomenon?" (theoretical synthesis)

**Key property:** Each OD makes explicit the relationship that DD explored implicitly. OD is the stage where implicit lessons become explicit design hypotheses.

---

#### AD (Axis Dimensions): COMPATIBILITY/EQUIVALENCE QUESTIONS
**Canonical form:** "Does [axis geometry] serve or contradict [OD-density identity]? Is this a [type] equivalence mechanism?"

**Question characteristics:**
- MECHANISTIC and FORMAL
- Shift from "can it work?" to "does X serve Y?"
- Introduce EQUIVALENCE MECHANISMS (temporal, spatial, proportional, kinetic)
- Most ARCHITECTURAL: asking whether two systems can coexist
- References R4 (axis research) + R2 + EXT-AXIS findings
- AD-001 through AD-005: specific axis-to-organization mappings
- AD-006: META-QUESTION about whether mechanisms unify

**Example evolution:**
- AD-001: "Does Z-Pattern serve PULSE+TIDAL? What equivalence?" (single axis-pattern pair)
- AD-002: "Does F-Pattern serve CRESCENDO? Proportional equivalence?" (parallel exploration)
- AD-006: "Does triple equivalence hold? Is meta-equivalence unifying all?" (theoretical synthesis)

**Key property:** AD introduces formal/mechanical thinking. No longer just asking "does it work?" but "what is the structural mechanism that makes it work?"

---

#### CD (Combination Dimensions): MULTI-VARIABLE INTEGRATION QUESTIONS
**Canonical form:** "Can [component A] + [component B] + [density X] + [organization Y] + [axis Z] coexist without violating [constraints]?"

**Question characteristics:**
- ENGINEERING-ORIENTED
- Stack multiple variables and test for compatibility
- Most PRACTICAL: directly translatable to build tasks
- Reference 40+ combination findings (R5: 39 findings, AD-F: 28, DD-F: 18, OD-F: 17)
- CD-001 through CD-005: specific multi-component integration tests
- CD-006: META-QUESTION about whether system is self-describing

**Example evolution:**
- CD-001: "Can 3 components + CRESCENDO + F→Bento axis coexist?" (dual-axis transition test)
- CD-002: "Can matrix embed as PULSE pause? Can transitions bridge 2 axes?" (component-within-organization test)
- CD-006: "Can this page explain itself? Does the system work end-to-end?" (meta-reflective proof)

**Key property:** CD is where the research vocabulary becomes building vocabulary. These questions are almost ready to hand to builders.

### The Cumulative Load Evolution

| Stage | Question Type | Cumulative Dependencies | Complexity Growth |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| DD | Standalone phenomenology | None | Low -- 6 independent density patterns |
| OD | Paired hypothesis | DD findings (6) | Medium -- each OD must account for DD constraints |
| AD | Compatibility testing | DD findings (6) + OD findings (6) | High -- each AD must unify 2 prior layers |
| CD | Integration testing | DD+OD+AD findings (18+) | Maximum -- each CD tests 8+ constraints simultaneously |

---

**Research base:** R5 (39 combination findings), AD-F findings (28), DD-F+OD-F findings (18+17)

---

## SECTION 4: TC'S 14-AXIS ARCHITECTURE

The Tension-Composition skill operates along these question axes:

| Axis | TC Question Frame |
|------|------------------|
| FEEL | What does the reader need to FEEL while navigating this content? |
| UNDERSTAND | What does the reader need to UNDERSTAND about the relationships? |
| DO | What does the reader need to DO with this content after reading? |
| BECOME | What does the reader need to BECOME after absorbing this content? |
| NAVIGATE | How does the reader need to MOVE THROUGH this content? |
| TRUST | What does the reader need to BELIEVE about this content's authority? |
| EVALUATE | What does the reader need to JUDGE about quality, validity, or fit? |
| ORIENT | What does the reader need to know about WHERE THIS FITS? |
| RECONCILE | What does the reader need to RECONCILE with prior beliefs? |
| COMPARE | What does the reader need to COMPARE to contextualize understanding? |
| IDENTIFY | What does the reader need to IDENTIFY as critical vs. decorative? |
| DISCOVER | What does the reader need to DISCOVER through exploration? |
| SEE | What does the reader need to SEE in terms of visual hierarchy? |
| REMEMBER | What does the reader need to REMEMBER after the page is gone? |

**Key property:** All 14 axes are READER-CENTRIC. The subject is always the reader's internal state, not the page's structure.

---

## SECTION 5: FIVE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TC AND EXPLORATION QUESTIONING

### Difference 1: SUBJECT ORIENTATION
**TC:** Reader-centric (What does the reader need?)
**Explorations:** Structure-centric (What if the information was shaped like THIS?)

The subject of TC questions is always the consumer. The subject of exploration questions is always the architecture.

### Difference 2: FRAMEWORK TYPE
**TC:** Experiential/Emotional framework
- TC derives questions by reading content and identifying tensions between reader needs and system personality
- Output: description of reader states (warmth, trust, awe, transformation)
- Metaphor IMPLIES structure but does not specify it

**Explorations:** Structural/Architectural framework
- Explorations derive questions from research findings about how information can be organized
- Output: specification of organizational principle, density pattern, fractal constraint, equivalence mechanism
- Metaphor IS the structure, pre-specified and testable

### Difference 3: GENERATIVE DIRECTION
**TC:** BOTTOM-UP (content → reader needs → tension → metaphor → structure)
**Explorations:** TOP-DOWN (research → structural hypothesis → select test content → build → evaluate)

TC starts by reading specific content. Explorations start by formulating a structural theory.

### Difference 4: SPECIFICITY LEVEL
**TC:** Metaphor implies structure (e.g., "refinery cross-section")
- Builder must translate "feel" to CSS decisions
- Risk: compliant but conventional
- Freedom: builder can interpret metaphor creatively

**Explorations:** Architecture pre-specifies structure (e.g., "4 confidence strata with inverse density-certainty mapping")
- Builder applies explicit structural rules
- Risk: can be formulaic
- Freedom: builder fills in aesthetic details within clear structure

### Difference 5: CUMULATIVE vs. FRESH
**TC:** FRESH each time (library access prohibition prevents reading prior explorations)
- Each content gets a unique, independent derivation
- Strength: no path dependency
- Weakness: must rediscover structural insights

**Explorations:** CUMULATIVE across stages (each stage builds on prior findings)
- DD → OD → AD → CD creates evolutionary chain
- Strength: knowledge carries forward and compounds
- Weakness: early design choices constrain later ones

---

## SECTION 6: STRUCTURAL PROPOSITIONS AS MISSING CATEGORY

### What TC Produces
- Emotional arc ("the reader should feel destabilized")
- Creative invitations ("try giving the digressions asymmetric margins")
- Tension-based motivation ("chaos against architecture")
- Metaphor with structural isomorphisms ("refinery cross-section")
- Per-zone experiential descriptions

### What Explorations Produce (But TC Does Not)
- Structural hypothesis with testable predictions
- Density pattern assignments (GEOLOGICAL, CRESCENDO, WAVE, etc.)
- Fractal constraint specifications at N scales
- **Density-content correlations** (e.g., "density inversely correlates with confidence")
- Component interaction predictions (e.g., "File Tree and Callout share left-anchored DNA")
- Transition grammar specifications (SMOOTH, BRIDGE, BREATHING assignments)
- Multi-pattern coexistence rules

### The Missing Category: STRUCTURAL PROPOSITIONS

**Definition:** Statements of the form "THIS structural relationship between content property X and visual property Y will produce outcome Z."

**Examples:**
- "Density correlates inversely with confidence. Established = sparse, speculative = dense."
- "Fractal self-similarity at 4 scales: same rhythm visible at page, section, component, character levels."
- "Conversational structure generates PULSE density naturally (Q creates sparse space, A fills dense space)."

**Why this matters:**
TC generates metaphors that IMPLY structural propositions but do not state them. The builder must infer the CSS rules from the emotional description. Exploration questions STATE the structural proposition directly, giving the builder a mechanical rule.

**Comparison:**
- TC: "The operations stratum is the page's density peak. The full system visible at once." (FEELING)
- Exploration: "Density correlates inversely with confidence. Established = sparse, speculative = dense." (STRUCTURAL PROPOSITION)

The first requires the builder to translate emotion into CSS. The second gives the builder a rule that generates CSS.

---

## SECTION 7: THE BRIDGE BETWEEN EXPERIENTIAL AND ARCHITECTURAL QUESTIONING

### The Gap

TC asks: "What does the reader need to FEEL?"
Explorations ask: "What if the information was shaped LIKE THIS?"

These are questions from different domains:
- TC operates in **phenomenology** (experience, emotion, meaning)
- Explorations operate in **information architecture** (structure, organization, spatial relationships)

### Why Both Are Needed

**TC strength:** Gives the builder emotional conviction. The Gas Town TC brief creates a powerful conceptual world ("refinery cross-section") that the builder inhabits while making CSS decisions.

**Exploration strength:** Gives the builder architectural certainty. OD-004's confidence stratification rule mechanically generates CSS decisions once stated.

### The Missing Middle

A complete pipeline would bridge these by asking: **"If the reader needs to FEEL this, and the information is organized LIKE THIS, what specific structural relationships should exist between content properties and visual properties?"**

This is the translation layer from phenomenology to architecture.

**Current state:**
- TC asks phenomenological questions (Phases 1-3)
- Explorations discovered architectural answers (through 24 questions across 4 stages)
- The translation from one to the other happens ad-hoc in the builder's mind

**What's missing:**
- A systematic way to ask structural proposition questions that are DERIVED from TC's phenomenological insights
- Explicit rules like "if the reader needs to feel X, then we should implement structural relationship Y"

### Example of the Bridge

**TC input:** "The reader needs to feel gradual disclosure -- starting with foundational confidence and building to speculation."

**Exploration answer:** "Implement OD-004 Confidence structure: 4 strata (established/probable/speculative/open) with inverse density-to-certainty mapping (certain=sparse, uncertain=dense). This naturally creates GEOLOGICAL density rhythm."

**Structural proposition (the bridge):** "Because the reader needs gradual disclosure and we're using confidence stratification, we should ensure dense content appears in speculative zones and sparse content in established zones. This creates a mechanical structure that serves the reader's phenomenological need."

**Builder's CSS rule:** "For each section marked [SPECULATION], apply GEOLOGICAL dense layer (tight spacing, 3px borders, high component count). For sections marked [ESTABLISHED], apply sparse layer (wide spacing, 1px borders, low component count)."

---

## SECTION 8: KEY FINDINGS SYNTHESIS

### Finding 1: Exploration Questions Are Research Instruments
The 24 generative questions are not creative prompts -- they are systematic research instruments designed to explore a design space:
- Each references specific prior findings (R3-003, DD-F-006, etc.)
- Each makes falsifiable predictions
- Each builds on predecessor discoveries
- Each tests specific mechanisms (temporal, spatial, proportional, kinetic equivalence)

### Finding 2: TC and Explorations Occupy Different Question Spaces
These are not competing approaches. They operate on different axes:
- **TC:** Phenomenological (feeling, emotion, metaphor)
- **Explorations:** Architectural (structure, organization, spatial relationships)

TC answers "What should this FEEL like?" Explorations answer "What if information was shaped LIKE THIS?" Both are valuable; both are incomplete without the other.

### Finding 3: The Specificity Gap Explains Richness Differences
Explorations pre-specify architectural structure (4 strata, inverse density-confidence mapping, GEOLOGICAL rhythm, fractal at 4 scales). TC specifies emotional intent (reader should feel gradual disclosure) but not structure. The builder must translate the second into CSS; the first is almost immediately CSS-generative.

This explains why exploration-derived pages tend to have higher "richness" scores -- not because explorations are inherently better, but because they specify MORE CONSTRAINTS that the builder must work within. Constraints force variation and prevent homogeneity.

### Finding 4: Structural Propositions Are Missing from TC
TC never generates statements like "density correlates inversely with confidence" or "conversational structure generates PULSE naturally." These structural propositions are DERIVED from the exploration process but are absent from TC's output.

A complete pipeline would generate both phenomenological questions (TC) and structural propositions (derived from explorations), giving the builder both emotional conviction and architectural certainty.

### Finding 5: Exploration Questions Show Knowledge Compounding
Each stage builds knowledge that becomes a constraint for the next:
- DD findings → OD constraints (each OD must maintain DD-F-006 fractal)
- OD findings → AD constraints (each AD must serve OD's organization-density identity)
- AD findings → CD constraints (each CD must respect transition grammar and axis patterns)

This cumulative approach produces emergent properties (the 5-stage unification, the equivalence mechanisms) that would be impossible to derive fresh at each stage.

---

## SECTION 9: DELIVERABLE IMPLICATIONS

### What This Means for Pipeline v3+

**The TC skill is doing the right thing** in asking experiential/emotional questions. The metaphor derivation is genuinely valuable.

**But TC is NOT generating the category of question that explorations did** -- structural hypothesis questions that connect content properties to visual properties through testable propositions.

**Missing from current pipeline:**
1. A mechanism to translate TC's phenomenological insights into structural propositions
2. Explicit rules that map reader needs to visual structures
3. Cumulative architectural knowledge that carries forward across content pieces

**Recommendation:** Consider adding a Phase 3.5 that asks: "Given this metaphor and this reader phenomenology, what structural relationships should exist?" This would bridge TC's experiential output to the exploration framework's structural specifications.

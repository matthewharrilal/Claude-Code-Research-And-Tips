# PA WEAVER — Synthesis + Verdict Protocol
## Pipeline v3 Layer 7 — Weaver Reference
Date: 2026-02-25
Status: AUTHORITATIVE — split from artifact-pa-protocol-MONOLITHIC.md
Split: Contains weaver protocol ONLY. How the weaver synthesizes reports, verdict categories, fix-type classification, emotional arc synthesis, diagnostic vocabulary. INFORMATION ISOLATION: this content should NOT be visible to auditors.

---

## 0. WEAVER EXPERIENTIAL ANCHOR (MANDATORY — Before All Other Actions)

> **POSITIONAL ENFORCEMENT:** This section is numbered 0 because the Weaver must
> perform its own experiential reading BEFORE reading any auditor report, gate result,
> or calibration scale. This prevents analytical contamination from auditor language.
> The experiential anchor is also embedded in the Weaver prompt template (MANIFEST.md Appendix E).

### 0.1 View the Screenshots Yourself

Open the 1440px screenshot set. Scroll through from cold-look to the last scroll shot.
Attempt to USE the page as a reader.

**CRITICAL: VISUAL VERIFICATION, NOT CODE INTERPRETATION.** You are looking at rendered
pixels. Your instinct is to DECODE text from context — inferring what a label "should"
say from the auditor reports you are about to read. Resist this. Report what the PIXELS
show you. If you cannot read text from the screenshot alone — without inferring from
structure or auditor descriptions — then that text is illegible.

1. **Read:** Can you read every heading, paragraph, label, caption, chart annotation
   FROM THE PIXELS ALONE? Note every failure — say what you SEE, not what you KNOW.
2. **Extract:** Can you extract information from every visual element? Note every failure.
3. **Navigate:** Does the page's structure guide you through the content? Note every
   breakdown.

### 0.2 Write Your Experiential Anchor

Write a 3-sentence first impression based on attempting to USE the page. This is your
EXPERIENTIAL ANCHOR.

This anchor has special status in the verdict:
- It CANNOT be overridden by auditor scores or gate results
- If your anchor identifies a comprehension failure, that becomes Fix #1 regardless of
  all other analysis
- If 0/9 auditors caught something your anchor found, your anchor takes precedence
  (the Weaver has the fullest context and the freshest eyes on the complete screenshot set)

### 0.3 Experiential Pass Aggregation (Enhanced)

After writing your own anchor, aggregate experiential pass results from all 9 auditors:

| Auditor Agreement | Classification | Weaver Action |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Weaver anchor + >= 1/9 auditor | CONFIRMED CRITICAL | Fix #1, BLOCKING |
| >= 3/9 flag same element | CONFIRMED illegibility | Fix #1 per Priority Override |
| Weaver anchor + 0/9 auditors | WEAVER-ONLY finding | Investigate — cite screenshot evidence |
| 1-2/9 flag same element | POSSIBLE issue | Investigate — cite specific reports |
| 0/9 flag + no weaver anchor | All text readable | No experiential action needed |

Report format: "Experiential: N CONFIRMED, M POSSIBLE, text fully readable at 0/9."

### 0.4 Tier 5 Scoring in All Rounds

Score Tier 5 (PA-60 through PA-77) in EVERY PA round, including initial rounds with known defects.
Tier 5 questions assess metaphor persistence, compositional intelligence, and emergent properties.
These are evaluable even when rendering defects are present.
A defective page with strong Tier 5 scores indicates IMPROVE potential.
A defective page with weak Tier 5 scores indicates RETHINK risk.

### 0.5 Then Proceed to Verification

AFTER completing Sections 0.1-0.4, proceed to the existing workflow below:
1. Manifest Verification (the current "FIRST ACTION" — now SECOND)
2. PA-05 Scoring
3. Tier 5 Scoring
...

---

## 1. WEAVER ROLE

> Source: ITEM 76 (extract-d01-d03.md, VA L191-192) — "reads 10 auditor reports -> VERDICT"
> Source: ITEM 87 (extract-d09-d11.md, VA L897) — "Phase 3: Weaver"
> Source: ITEM 88 (extract-d09-d11.md, VA L898) — "Agent 15 (Weaver) = 15 total agents"
> Source: ITEM 89 (extract-d09-d11.md, VA L899) — "Weaver must be Opus"

The Weaver reads ALL 10 auditor reports (9 PA auditors + 1 Integrative) and produces:

0. **Manifest Verification** — FIRST ACTION: verify all 9 auditor completion manifests total 69 answered questions. Any missing = INCOMPLETE.
1. **PA-05 Score** (1-4 scale with sub-criteria breakdown). Includes cross-validation resolution: for each sub-criterion, compare Auditor A's primary score with the cross-validator's secondary score. If they disagree, explain and resolve.
2. **Tier 5 Score** (0-9 YES count with per-question results)
3. **Combined Verdict** (from the PA-05 x Tier 5 matrix)
4. **Top-5 Fixes** (classified as MECHANICAL / STRUCTURAL / COMPOSITIONAL — see Section 3 for diagnostic vocabulary)
5. **Fix-Type Classification Summary** (REQUIRED) — aggregate count of fixes by type: N MECHANICAL, N STRUCTURAL, N COMPOSITIONAL. This classification directly determines the Ship Decision: POLISH requires ALL fixes to be MECHANICAL and <= 3 total. Any STRUCTURAL or COMPOSITIONAL fix disqualifies POLISH and requires IMPROVE or RETHINK respectively. Include a 1-sentence remediation path per fix type present.
6. **Emotional Arc Synthesis** (REQUIRED) — using the 4-register framework (Section 4), synthesize across all auditor reports to produce: (a) a score for each register (SURPRISE, DELIGHT, AUTHORITY, EARNED CLOSURE) on a 1-10 scale, (b) the overall arc shape ("building-peaking-resolving" vs "flat" vs "front-loaded"), and (c) the single strongest and weakest emotional register with evidence citations from auditor reports.
7. **Ship Decision** (RELEASE / POLISH / IMPROVE / RETHINK)
8. **Improvement Vector** (REQUIRED) — Based on all auditor reports, identify the single change (not a fix — a creative improvement) that would most elevate this page. Frame as aspiration, not defect: "The page would come alive if..." or "The strongest unrealized potential is..." This is distinct from the fix list. Fixes address defects; the improvement vector addresses POTENTIAL.

> **Note:** Items 5, 6, and 8 were previously implicit or absent in weaver output but are now REQUIRED sections. The Weaver's verdict is INCOMPLETE if any is missing.

---

## 2. WEAVER CALIBRATION REFERENCES

> **WARNING (FIX-084): WEAVER USE ONLY.** The tier definitions, quality tier tables, and calibration data in this section are for the WEAVER's classification use ONLY. They MUST NOT be included in PA Auditor A-I prompts. The fresh-eyes principle prohibits tier context for individual auditors. Including tier targets in auditor prompts would anchor their assessments on expected outcomes rather than genuine perception.

> **SEQUENCING (FIX-085):** Calibration references are CLASSIFICATION tools, not evaluation rubrics. The Weaver must FIRST describe observations in own words, THEN classify using the reference scales below. Reading scales before describing evidence risks anchoring on categories rather than perceiving what is actually there.

### 2.1 Multi-Coherence Scale

| Simultaneous Shifts at Boundary | Quality Level |
|--------------------------------|---------------|
| 0-1 | FLAT |
| 2 | FUNCTIONAL |
| 3 | DESIGNED |
| 4-5 | COMPOSED |
| 6 | FLAGSHIP |

### 2.2 Severity Scale

| Dead Space | Severity |
|------------|----------|
| 1-2 viewport-heights | LOOKS-WRONG |
| 3-5 viewport-heights | WOULD-NOT-SHIP |
| 6+ viewport-heights | CATASTROPHIC |

### 2.3 Metaphor Expression Spectrum

| Level | Expression | Quality |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| STRUCTURAL | Spatial organization, color progression, visual weight | HIGHEST |
| ATMOSPHERIC | Palette, typography, vocabulary choices | HIGH |
| LABELED | Explicit text labels on structural elements | MEDIUM |
| ANNOUNCED | Section titles explain the metaphor | LOW |

### 2.4 Quality Tiers (Discrete Registers)

| Tier | PA-05 Range | Mechanisms | CSS Lines | Coupling Register |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| FLOOR | < 2.5 | 5 | 150-250 | Register 0 (NO coupling) |
| MIDDLE (default) | 2.5-3.0 | 8-10 | 350-500 | Register 1 (LOCAL coupling) |
| CEILING | 3.0-3.5 | 12-15 | 700-1000 | Register 2 (STRUCTURAL coupling) |
| FLAGSHIP | >= 3.5 | 16-18 | 1000-1500 | Register 3 (ATMOSPHERIC coupling) |

### 2.5 PA-05 x Tier 5 Combined Verdict Matrix

| | PA-05 < 3/4 | PA-05 = 3/4 | PA-05 = 4/4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 5: 0-2** | NOT SHIP-READY | STYLED (template) | VOCABULARY ONLY |
| **Tier 5: 3-5** | NOT SHIP-READY | STRUCTURED | STRUCTURED |
| **Tier 5: 6-7** | (unlikely) | APPROACHING | APPROACHING |
| **Tier 5: 8-9** | (impossible in practice) | (unlikely) | **COMPOSED** (target) |

---

## 3. WEAVER DIAGNOSTIC VOCABULARY

> Source: FIX-086 — Currently the Weaver must infer diagnostic categories without guidance.

When classifying fixes in the Top-5 list, the Weaver uses these diagnostic categories with their evidence signatures:

| Category | Definition | Evidence Pattern | Remediation |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **MECHANICAL** | Fix by changing a CSS value | Auditors cite SPECIFIC elements with SPECIFIC visual problems (e.g., "the gap between S3 and S4 is too large") | Builder changes the value directly |
| **STRUCTURAL** | Reorganize zones, boundaries, or grids | Auditors cite SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP problems (e.g., "sections feel disconnected," "no visual hierarchy between zones") | Builder re-reads TC brief Sections 2+4, reorganizes zone structure |
| **COMPOSITIONAL** | Re-invoke tension-composition | Auditors cite ABSENCE of unifying logic or metaphor (e.g., "elements feel random," "no governing idea visible," "competent but soulless") | Requires TC re-invocation (TYPE C fix cycle — new conviction, new TC brief) |

### 3.1 Diagnostic Decision Tree

1. Can the problem be fixed by changing ONE CSS property? --> MECHANICAL
2. Can the problem be fixed by reorganizing existing elements? --> STRUCTURAL
3. Does the problem require rethinking the page's compositional logic? --> COMPOSITIONAL

---

## 4. EMOTIONAL ARC FRAMEWORK (4 Registers)

### 4.1 Council Ruling: PA Auditor Is Primary

> Sources: CF-02, Contradiction C, ITEM 032/037 — PA auditor is the PRIMARY emotional arc check. Compositional Critic OVERRIDDEN (N=0, EXPERIMENTAL). Emotional arc is EMERGENT, not SPECIFIED — cannot be gate-checked.

### 4.2 Four Emotional Registers

> Source: ITEM 001 (extract-d21-d25.md, VA L1572-1574) — "4 emotional registers distinct from density arc"

Emotional arc has 4 registers, each with CSS signatures and assessment criteria:

**1. SURPRISE** — moment page does something unexpected
- CSS signatures: scale break (headline 2.5x body), color inversion (dark zone mid-page), layout rupture (grid after 4+ single-column viewports), structural inversion (border-RIGHT in border-LEFT page)
- Expected: 1-2 moments only, in SECOND HALF (D-04)
- Disposition link: D-04 'Second-half moment' creates CONDITIONS for surprise (not guaranteed)

**2. DELIGHT** — small unexpected refinements that reward attention
- CSS signatures: hover states revealing hidden content, typographic micro-refinement (tabular-nums, text-indent), zone-specific ::selection colors, print-specific styling, first/last child edge treatments
- Expected: distributed throughout, more in high-density zones
- Disposition link: D-07 'Edge intentionality' creates conditions for delight

**3. AUTHORITY** — page knows what it is, every element expresses certainty
- CSS signatures: consistent border-weight hierarchy (4px ALWAYS = primary), restraint (knowing what NOT to use), dense purposeful header (dark bg, tight spacing), zero decorative elements
- Expected: should be HIGH throughout (soul ensures)
- Disposition link: D-03 'Would you sign this?' creates conditions for authority

**4. EARNED CLOSURE** — ending feels earned by the journey
- CSS signatures: footer echoes header (bookending), density arc resolves (Z4 releases what Z3 compressed), final drop cap or typographic moment, breathing space before footer (80-120px gap)
- Expected: only in final 2-3 viewports, must be EARNED
- Disposition link: D-05 'Scroll as reader' creates conditions for closure

### 4.3 How PA Questions Map to Emotional Registers

Emotional arc is EMERGENT — it cannot be specified or gate-checked. The PA auditor assesses it post-build through:

1. **PA-35** (scroll at reading speed — interest peaks/valleys/fades) detects overall arc shape
2. **PA-36** (dramatic visual moment — position and impact) detects SURPRISE placement
3. **PA-13** (clear visual ending?) detects CLOSURE
4. **PA-45** (single moment to show someone as good design) detects DELIGHT
5. **PA-05** sub-criterion DESIGNED detects AUTHORITY
6. **PA-47** (anything surprising in second half) detects late-page SURPRISE

The Weaver synthesizes these into an emotional arc assessment using the 4-register framework.

### 4.4 Disposition-Emotion Links (DESIGN INTENTIONS, Not Guarantees)

> Source: council-verdict.md, Contradiction C — "DESIGN INTENTIONS, not guaranteed causal links"

| Disposition | Creates Conditions For | Evidence |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| D-03 'Would you sign this?' | AUTHORITY | DESIGN INTENTION (not guaranteed) |
| D-04 'Second-half moment' | SURPRISE | DESIGN INTENTION (not guaranteed) |
| D-05 'Scroll as reader' | CLOSURE | DESIGN INTENTION (not guaranteed) |
| D-07 'Edge intentionality' | DELIGHT | DESIGN INTENTION (not guaranteed) |

---

## 4.5 PRIORITY OVERRIDE RULE

Before ordering fixes: "Is there ANY finding from ANY auditor that describes
something a reader CANNOT READ or CANNOT USE?"

If yes: that finding is Fix #1, regardless of gate status.

Fix priority order: (1) Human readability/usability, (2) Visual perception,
(3) Identity compliance. After emotional arc analysis, check whether any fix
would improve the weakest register — if so, it ranks higher.

---

## 5. SHIP DECISION AND FEEDBACK LOOP

### 5.0 Rendering vs Composition Failure Classification

When scoring PA-05 and issuing verdict, distinguish:

**Rendering gaps** (IMPROVE can address):
- Contrast/visibility issues (wrong opacity, DPR artifacts)
- Missing interactive states (no hovers, no focus indicators)
- Spacing anomalies (stacked margins, excessive gaps)
- Typography sizing (too small footer text, inconsistent weights)
- Color calibration (backgrounds too similar, insufficient delta)

**Composition gaps** (RETHINK needed):
- No discernible zone structure (content reads as single column blob)
- Zero mechanism deployment (flat HTML with no spatial/temporal devices)
- Metaphor absence when content demands metaphor
- Fundamental content misrepresentation (wrong emphasis, missing sections)
- Soul violations that require HTML restructuring (wrong container, decorative elements)

If ALL flagged issues are rendering gaps: verdict is IMPROVE (standard path). If ANY issue is a composition gap: verdict is RETHINK.
IMPROVE is the pipeline's highest-value phase: +1.0 to +1.5 PA-05 per pass. The IMPROVE pass consistently produces larger quality jumps than any other single intervention.

### 5.1 Ship Thresholds

> Source: ITEM 77 (extract-d01-d03.md, VA L201-204)

| Condition | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| PA-05 >= 3.5/4 AND zero soul violations AND (cycle >= 1 OR builder_ideas == 0) | **RELEASE** |
| PA-05 >= 3/4 AND all identity gates PASS AND <= 3 MECHANICAL fixes needed | **POLISH** (see 5.1.1) |
| Cycle 0 complete (standard two-cycle default) OR PA-05 2.5-3.5 | **IMPROVE** (see 5.2) |
| PA-05 < 2.5 | **RETHINK** (see 5.3) |

> Note: You cannot RELEASE from Cycle 0 if the builder reported improvement ideas — those ideas are evidence that the page has more potential. IMPROVE is the standard path, not a failure signal.

#### 5.1.1 POLISH Protocol

**POLISH** is distinct from both RELEASE and IMPROVE. It means: the page is compositionally sound and meets quality threshold, but has a small number of identifiable mechanical defects. Criteria:
- PA-05 >= 3/4 (COMPOSED or higher)
- All identity gates (soul, prohibitions) PASS
- <= 3 fixes needed, ALL classified as MECHANICAL (not STRUCTURAL or COMPOSITIONAL)
- Fixes are applied by the SAME builder (no fresh agent needed), then verified by a single spot-check auditor

### 5.2 IMPROVE Protocol

> Source: ITEM 78 (extract-d01-d03.md, VA L206-210) — "DIFFERENT Opus agent, reads conviction"

- DIFFERENT Opus agent (defeats continuation bias)
- Reads conviction artifact + PA artistic impressions
- Refine agent NEVER sees gate scores or threshold numbers
> Source: ITEM 050 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1259)

### 5.3 RETHINK Protocol

> Source: ITEM 79 (extract-d01-d03.md, VA L212-215) — "FRESH builder in COMPOSING mode"

- FRESH Opus builder
- In COMPOSING mode (not REPAIR mode)
- Reads previous conviction artifact (not fix list)
- Generative language, not diagnostic
> Source: ITEM 044-046 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1252-1254)

### 5.4 Feedback Language

> Source: ITEM 80 (extract-d01-d03.md, VA L219-220) — "Returns to Phase 2 with PA verdict as CONTEXT (generative language)"

PA verdict goes back to Phase 2 as CONTEXT in generative language. NOT: "SC-09 FAILED: stacked gap 210px exceeds 120px." YES: "The middle sags — energy dissipates by S5."

> Source: ITEM 14, ITEM 15 (extract-d06-d08.md, VA L509-514)

### 5.5 Finding Status Map (Iteration Cycles >= 2)

For cycle >= 2, the Weaver MUST include a Finding Status Map in the diagnostic output:

| Pass N-1 Finding | Status | Evidence |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| [finding text] | FIXED / IMPROVED / UNCHANGED / REGRESSION | [screenshot ref] |

Status definitions: FIXED = no longer visible. IMPROVED = visible but reduced severity. UNCHANGED = same severity. REGRESSION = worse than previous pass.
If ANY finding is REGRESSION: flag as BLOCKING and recommend HALT (compositional averaging risk).
Enforced by GR-82 (RECOMMENDED). See gate-runner-core.js.

### 5.6 Forward Assessment

Do NOT predict post-fix PA-05 SCORES (numeric predictions anchor expectations). Instead, describe the PAGE'S TRAJECTORY: "The composition has strong bones — the metaphor is structural, transitions are varied, the density arc has shape. The unrealized potential is in [specific area]." Frame what the page COULD BECOME, not what score it might reach. Enforced by GR-81 (ADVISORY — no numeric predictions).

---

## 6. PA-ASSESSED ANTI-PATTERNS (Weaver Context)

### 6.1 Anti-Patterns Requiring Perceptual Judgment

> Source: ITEM 023 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1188) — "4 require PERCEPTUAL AUDIT (PA-05 questions)"
> Source: ITEM 026 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1192) — "Phase 3 PA adds anti-pattern-aware questions"

The Weaver should watch for these anti-patterns in auditor reports:

| AP | Anti-Pattern | What It Detects | PA Questions That Catch It |
|----|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| AP-02 | COLOR ZONE CONFLICT | Hierarchy DISAGREEMENT between color zones | PA-18, PA-55 |
| AP-03 | TRANSITION MONOTONY | All zones use identical dividers | PA-17, PA-69, PA-62 |
| AP-05 | SPACING FLAT-LINE | Density arc compresses uniformly | PA-69, PA-66 |
| AP-06 | CHANNEL ISOLATION | 6 channels shift not at same boundaries | PA-69, PA-61 |
| AP-07 | METAPHOR BLEED | Vocabulary leaks across zone boundaries | PA-44, PA-68 |
| AP-08 | COMPONENT ORPHAN | Component styled for wrong zone | PA-63, PA-19 |
| AP-12 | RESTRAINT EROSION | Additions erode deliberate absences | PA-64 |
| AP-13 | BOOKEND ASYMMETRY | Header/footer echo breaks in revision | PA-13, PA-24 |

### 6.2 Improvement Pass Awareness (Watch for Unintended Side Effects)

> Source: ITEM 028 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1199) — "REVISION QUALITY — WHY FIX CYCLES DEGRADE COMPOSITION"

IMPROVE passes deepen composition, but changes can have side effects. Watch for:

| Warning | What Degrades | Source |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Multi-channel encoding decouples | Fix to one channel breaks alignment with others | ITEM 038 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1237-1238) |
| Density arcs flatten | Individual zone correction breaks overall arc | ITEM 039 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1239-1240) |
| Bookending symmetry breaks | Modifying one end breaks header/footer echo | ITEM 040 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1241-1242) |
| Component-context coupling breaks | CSS changes disconnect components from zones | ITEM 041 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1243-1244) |
| Restraint coherence degrades | Changing mechanisms shifts what "restraint" means | ITEM 042 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1245-1246) |

These inform the Weaver's fix-type classification. COMPOSITIONAL fixes should not be attempted through MECHANICAL means.

---

## 7. MODE DETERMINANTS (Applied vs Composed Detection)

### 7.1 PA-Relevant Mode Indicators

The Weaver can detect whether a page was built in APPLIED or COMPOSED mode through auditor observations:

| Determinant | APPLIED Mode | COMPOSED Mode | Source |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Layout choice driver | Content-type driven | Metaphor driven | ITEM 76 (extract-d18-d20.md, VA L1552) |
| Governing logic | Absent (no articulable in 1 sentence) | Present | ITEM 78 (extract-d18-d20.md, VA L1554) |
| Component adaptation | Callouts identical across zones | Callouts adapt to zone context | ITEM 64-65 (extract-d18-d20.md, VA L1520-1526) |
| Removal impact | Remove A, B unchanged | Remove A, B's meaning shifts | ITEM 55-56 (extract-d18-d20.md, VA L1498-1499) |

### 7.2 PA Questions That Detect Mode

- **PA-03** ("one designer or three") — COMPOSED mode reads as "one designer"
- **PA-05a** ("intentional composition or assembled") — COMPOSED = intentional, APPLIED = assembled
- **PA-63** (fractal zoom / component adaptation) — directly detects zone-responsive components
- **PA-65** (music analogy) — "ensemble" = COMPOSED, "choir in unison" = APPLIED
- **PA-70** (content-form coupling) — COMPOSED mode shows visual density matching content density

---

## 8. CROSS-PAGE COHERENCE (Family DNA — Weaver Context)

> Source: ITEM 052 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1268) — "CROSS-PAGE COHERENCE — FAMILY DNA"
> Source: ITEM 053 (extract-d15-d17.md, VA L1273) — "~30 CSS properties IDENTICAL between independently-built pages"

The Weaver assesses cross-page coherence through auditor reports on:
- **PA-24:** Does this feel like it belongs to a SYSTEM, or is it one-off custom work?
- **PA-25:** Does the identity persist throughout, or only in the header?

The shared DNA (~30 identical properties) comes from tokens.css + soul constraints + components.css. No additional cross-page gate is needed — the DNA is INHERENT.

---

## 9. 12 VALUES ITEMS — WEAVER CLASSIFICATION CONTEXT

> **WARNING (FIX-084): WEAVER USE ONLY.** The tier definitions, quality tier tables, and calibration data in this section are for the WEAVER's classification use ONLY. They MUST NOT be included in PA Auditor A-I prompts.

### 9.1 The 12 Rerouted Items

> Source: council-verdict.md, Part 2, Pattern 5, Category B — "REROUTE to PA AUDITOR (quality assessment) — 12 items"

The gate-runner checks BINARY constraints only. Quality tier assessments require judgment and belong with the PA auditor (specifically, the WEAVER who synthesizes all auditor reports).

### 9.3 CCS Items — RESEARCH CONSTRUCT Warning

> Source: council-verdict.md, Part 2, Pattern 5 — "CCS thresholds CANNOT be gate-checked until methodology is standardized"

The following items reference CCS. The Weaver may use them for qualitative context but must NOT use CCS as a numeric pass/fail criterion:

| Item ID | Source | Text | CCS Reference |
|---------|--------|------|---------------|
| ITEM 22 (extract-d18-d20.md) | VA L1406 | PA-05 measures perceived quality | CCS is separate |
| ITEM 28 (extract-d18-d20.md) | VA L1415 | CCS measures MECHANISM INTERDEPENDENCE | Definition only |
| ITEM 31 (extract-d18-d20.md) | VA L1420 | CCS 0.00-1.00 scale | Scale definition |

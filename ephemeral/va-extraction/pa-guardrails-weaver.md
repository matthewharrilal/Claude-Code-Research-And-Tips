# PA GUARDRAILS — Weaver/Orchestrator Only
## Pipeline v3 Layer 7 — Guardrails (Weaver Context)
Date: 2026-02-25
Status: AUTHORITATIVE — split from pa-guardrails.md
Split: Contains guardrail sections that use PIPELINE VOCABULARY (tiers, channels, mechanisms, anti-patterns, thresholds). This file is for the Weaver and Orchestrator ONLY. PA Auditors must NOT receive this file.

---

## 1. TIER 1 EQUIVALENT QUESTIONS

PA-17 (visual rhythm) and PA-41 (pattern repetition without variation) are TIER 1 EQUIVALENT. FAIL on either = verdict cannot exceed "YES WITH RESERVATIONS."

---

## 2. TIER 5 PROVISIONAL SCORING NOTE

Tier 5 scoring thresholds (8-9 = COMPOSED, 6-7 = APPROACHING, etc.) are PROVISIONAL with N=1 validation (derived from compositional intelligence stack theory, not from observed Flagship artifacts). Treat these thresholds as hypotheses until at least N=3 data points exist. Boundary cases (e.g., exactly 6 or exactly 8) should be reported with the caveat "threshold is provisional."

## 3. PA-ASSESSED ANTI-PATTERNS (Full Context)

Some anti-patterns cannot be detected programmatically. They require the PA auditor's perceptual judgment:

| AP | Anti-Pattern | What It Detects | PA Questions That Catch It |
|----|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| AP-02 | COLOR ZONE CONFLICT | Hierarchy DISAGREEMENT between color zones | PA-18 (color family), PA-55 (zone differences) |
| AP-03 | TRANSITION MONOTONY | All zones use identical dividers | PA-17 (rhythm), PA-69 (transition variation), PA-62 (Tier 5) |
| AP-05 | SPACING FLAT-LINE | Density arc compresses uniformly | PA-69 (transition variation), PA-66 (negative space variety) |
| AP-06 | CHANNEL ISOLATION | 6 channels shift not at same boundaries | PA-69 (transition properties), PA-61 (multi-voice) |
| AP-07 | METAPHOR BLEED | Vocabulary leaks across zone boundaries | PA-44 (metaphor persistence), PA-68 (metaphor coverage) |
| AP-08 | COMPONENT ORPHAN | Component styled for wrong zone | PA-63 (fractal zoom), PA-19 (different website element) |
| AP-12 | RESTRAINT EROSION | Additions erode deliberate absences | PA-64 (restraint as expression) |
| AP-13 | BOOKEND ASYMMETRY | Header/footer echo breaks in revision | PA-13 (clear ending), PA-24 (system coherence) |

---

## 4. REVISION DEGRADATION WARNINGS

Fix cycles can DEGRADE composition. Watch for:

| Warning | What Degrades |
|---------|--------------|
| Multi-channel encoding decouples | Fix to one channel breaks alignment with others |
| Density arcs flatten | Individual zone correction breaks overall arc |
| Bookending symmetry breaks | Modifying one end breaks header/footer echo |
| Component-context coupling breaks | CSS changes disconnect components from zones |
| Restraint coherence degrades | Changing mechanisms shifts what "restraint" means |

---

## 5. S-09 STACKING CHECK (MANDATORY at every section boundary)

> Total boundary gap = section bottom padding + divider margins + divider height + next section top padding
> <= 120px: PASS | > 120px: VOID-RISK | > 200px: CATASTROPHIC VOID

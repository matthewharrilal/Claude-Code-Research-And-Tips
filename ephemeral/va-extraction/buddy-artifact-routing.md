## Summary

The artifact is a comprehensive, well-structured treatment of all Layer 8 ROUTING content. It covers Phase 0 content analysis, Phase 1 brief assembly, content-form routing (APPLIED vs COMPOSED), compression physics, temporal composition (scroll rhythm), reader model (5-axis), the survival function, information flow architecture, and all three council-added items. The Complete Item Registry at the end enumerates exactly 125 items across 10 source-organized tables.

**Overall quality:** HIGH. The artifact correctly synthesizes 125 ROUTING items from the unified registry, applies all council reclassifications, cross-references items from adjacent layers (SCAFFOLDING, DISPOSITION, GATES, ORCHESTRATION) where contextually relevant, and provides rich narrative context for each sub-topic.

## Council-Added Items Check

### 1. Content-Volume-to-Zone-Count Map (actionability item #3)

- **Council verdict reference (Part 5, item #4):** "Content-volume-to-zone-count map (actionability #3, 6 lines) -- ROOT CAUSE prevention"
- **Artifact section:** "Content-Volume-to-Zone-Count Map (Council-Added)" (lines 516-537)
- **Content:** Full 5-row table mapping word counts to zone ranges. 6 lines as specified.
- **Assembly phase placement:** "This runs during assembly (Phase 0-1), not during gate verification." -- matches council instruction.
- **Registry inclusion:** Row #123 in Complete Item Registry.
- **STATUS: PRESENT AND CORRECT**

### 2. Content-Form Fit Gate (actionability item #4)

- **Council verdict reference (Part 5, item #5):** "Content-form fit gate (actionability #4, 5 lines) -- ROOT CAUSE prevention"
- **Artifact section:** "Content-Form Fit Gate (Council-Added)" (lines 540-557)
- **Content:** 5-line gate specification with all 4 routing conditions + 1 FAIL condition.
- **Assembly phase placement:** "runs during assembly (Phase 1) as a pre-build check" -- matches council instruction.
- **Registry inclusion:** Row #124 in Complete Item Registry.
- **STATUS: PRESENT AND CORRECT**

### 3. Content-Type Propagation to Builder (actionability item #17)

- **Council verdict reference (Part 5, item not explicitly listed but D21-25 ITEM 076):** "Add content-type propagation to builder (#17)"
- **Artifact section:** "Content-Type Propagation to Builder (Council-Added)" (lines 620-631)
- **Content:** 3 propagation requirements (header line, mode stated explicitly, single routing decision).
- **Registry inclusion:** Row #125 in Complete Item Registry.
- **STATUS: PRESENT AND CORRECT**

---

## Survival Function Placement Check

**Council verdict (Pattern 4):** "The survival function S(x) = 1/(1+C(x)) describes a zero-tolerance policy... This is a CURATION function that runs during prompt assembly (Phase 0-1), not a runtime gate check (Phase 3)."

**Artifact treatment (lines 560-586):**
- Header: "STATUS: RECLASSIFIED PER COUNCIL VERDICT"
- Quotes council: "Layer ROUTING -> GATES. Agent GATE-RUNNER -> ORCHESTRATOR."
- "When it runs: During prompt assembly (Phase 0-1), NOT during verification (Phase 3)."
- "Who runs it: ORCHESTRATOR (not gate-runner)."
- Function definition preserved with full mathematical specification.
- Registry rows #112-113 correctly show ORCHESTRATOR agent (reclassified from GATE-RUNNER in the registry).

**STATUS: CORRECTLY PLACED IN ASSEMBLY PHASE, CORRECTLY RECLASSIFIED**

## Council Verdict Compliance Notes

The artifact includes a comprehensive "Council Verdict Compliance Notes" section (lines 819-841) that explicitly tracks 9 compliance items:

1. Survival function reclassification -- APPLIED
2. "Activation" framing retirement -- APPLIED (replaced with "PURPOSE + VOCABULARY" on line 363)
3. CF-01 73-line accounting -- APPLIED (parenthetical on lines 405, 616)
4. CF-02 Compositional Critic -- CORRECTLY EXCLUDED (belongs to ORCHESTRATION layer)
5. CF-03 Suppressor removal -- APPLIED (survival function in assembly)
6. CF-04 N=4 evidence taxonomy -- APPLIED (noted where relevant, line 833)
7. Pattern 1 GATES->BUILDER -- APPLIED (dual-route on line 476)
8. Pattern 3 ORCH->BUILDER mode sub-ruling -- APPLIED (line 295-297)
9. Pattern 4 ROUTING->GATE-RUNNER -- APPLIED (2 items reclassified)

**All 9 compliance points verified.**

## Issues Found

### ISSUE 1: Footer Arithmetic Error (MINOR)

**Line 843:** "Total items: 125 (63 from layer classifier + 62 additional from unified registry cross-matches) + 3 council-added items = 128 total tracked. All Layer 8 items accounted for. Zero compression."

The 3 council-added items (D21-25 ITEMs 061, 062, 076) are already included as rows #123, #124, #125 in the 125-item registry. The "+3 = 128" double-counts them. The correct statement is: "Total items: 125 (63 from layer classifier + 62 additional, including 3 council-added items). All Layer 8 items accounted for."

**Severity:** Minor (cosmetic math error, does not affect content correctness).

### ISSUE 2: Header Count Discrepancy (MINOR)

**Line 5:** "Items covered: 63 from layer classifier + all ROUTING-tagged items from unified registry (125 total)"

This implies 63 + 125 = 188, or alternatively that 63 is a subset of 125. The intended meaning is likely: "125 ROUTING items from unified registry (63 originally classified by the layer classifier, 62 additional cross-matches)." The current phrasing is ambiguous.

**Severity:** Minor (ambiguous phrasing, not wrong).

### ISSUE 3: Cross-Layer References Not Flagged as Non-ROUTING (MINOR)

The narrative body references several items from other layers (SCAFFOLDING, DISPOSITION, GATES, ORCHESTRATION) via blockquotes. Examples:
- D18-20 ITEMs 58, 59, 64, 65, 79-85 (SCAFFOLDING/DISPOSITION)
- D01-03 ITEMs 131-133 (GATES/ORCHESTRATION)
- D12-14 ITEMs 34-45, 64-68 (SCAFFOLDING/PERCEPTION)

These are contextually appropriate cross-references, but none are explicitly flagged as "cross-layer reference (not ROUTING)." A reader might assume all blockquoted items are ROUTING items. They are NOT included in the 125-item registry, which is correct, but the narrative could be clearer.

**Severity:** Minor (no data error, could improve readability).

### ISSUE 4: D18-D20 ITEM 5/7 Registry Row Shows GATE-RUNNER but Artifact Shows ORCHESTRATOR (EXPECTED)

The unified registry still has D18-D20 ITEMs 5 and 7 as `ROUTING | GATE-RUNNER`. The artifact correctly applies the council reclassification to `ORCHESTRATOR`. This is NOT an error -- the council verdict supersedes the registry classification, and the artifact correctly notes this. However, the unified registry itself may need updating to reflect the council verdict.

**Severity:** Not an artifact issue. Unified registry may need separate update.

## Missing Items Check

I verified all 125 ROUTING-tagged items from the unified registry against the artifact's Complete Item Registry:

- **D01-D03 ROUTING items:** All present (ITEMs 4-5, 7-15, 17-19, 31-37, 47, 105-108)
- **D04-D05 ROUTING items:** All present (ITEMs 1-2, 5-9, 11-14, 16-17, 28-30)
- **D06-D08 ROUTING items:** All present (ITEMs 41-45, 47, 61)
- **D12-D14 ROUTING items:** All present (ITEMs 1-2, 4-6, 13-23, 25-30, 32-33, 46-63, 76-78, 80-81, 85, 88-91, 94, 97-102)
- **D18-D20 ROUTING items:** All present (ITEMs 2-5, 7, 11-19)
- **D21-D25 ROUTING items:** All present (ITEMs 061, 062, 076)

**Zero missing items.**

## Verdict

**PASS**

The artifact correctly captures all 125 Layer 8 ROUTING items from the unified registry. All 3 council-added items are present with correct specifications. The survival function is correctly placed in the assembly phase per council Pattern 4 verdict. All 9 council compliance points are addressed. Cross-layer references are contextually appropriate. The only issues are minor: a footer arithmetic double-count (128 should be 125), an ambiguous header phrasing, and unmarked cross-layer references in the narrative body. None of these affect the artifact's correctness or usability.

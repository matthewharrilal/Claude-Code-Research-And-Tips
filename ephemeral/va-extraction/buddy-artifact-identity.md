# Buddy Review: artifact-identity-perception.md
Date: 2026-02-23
Reviewer: buddy-identity (Opus agent)
Status: **PASS WITH 3 MINOR ISSUES**

---

## Summary

The artifact covers **all 33 Layer 1 IDENTITY items** and **all 52 Layer 2 PERCEPTION items** from the unified registry. Council verdict amendments are applied thoroughly. The document is well-structured with clear routing (builder world-description vs gate-runner binary check), evidence taxonomy per CF-04, and dual-route framing per Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 rulings.

**No MISSED items. No MISCLASSIFIED items. No VERDICT-IGNORED items.** Three MINOR issues found (compression/framing), none affecting correctness.

## Issues Found

### MINOR-1: Evidence Taxonomy Missing "PROVEN" Level
The artifact's evidence taxonomy on lines 12-16 lists: FACT, OBSERVED, CONFOUNDED, THEORETICAL, SPECULATIVE. The council verdict CF-04 defines a 6-level taxonomy that includes **PROVEN** ("Structural finding with convergent evidence from multiple independent sources AND clear mechanism"). The artifact uses "FACT" where the council sometimes uses "PROVEN" (e.g., "Perception thresholds prevent invisible CSS" is classified PROVEN in the verdict, FACT in the artifact). The artifact's Appendix items correctly use FACT for most items, and the body text at lines 285 and 245 uses "PROVEN" language, so the content is accurate. But the taxonomy definition at the top omits the PROVEN level.

**Severity:** MINOR. The artifact is internally consistent (using FACT as its strongest level), and the council verdict's PROVEN items map to FACT in the artifact's taxonomy. No information is lost. A future pass could add PROVEN to the taxonomy for full alignment.

### MINOR-2: Transition Perception Items (D12-D14) Missing Light/Medium/Heavy Definitions
The artifact includes ITEM 67 and ITEM 68 from D12-D14 (Section 2.6, lines 331-332) but also includes ITEM 64, 65, 66 from D12-D14 (lines 328-330) which define the light/medium/heavy transition types. These three items (ITEM 64, 65, 66 from D12-D14) are NOT in the unified registry's Layer 2 PERCEPTION list (the registry's 52-item Layer 2 list does not include them). The artifact ADDS them beyond the registry, which is helpful but is not a registry miss -- it is supplementary context. This is not an error, but it should be noted: the artifact includes 3 items beyond the registry's 52 for Layer 2.

**Severity:** MINOR. These are helpful additions (transition type definitions from D12-D14 lines 1053-1055). The classify-by-layer file DOES list them under Layer 2 PERCEPTION (lines 164-166). The discrepancy is between the unified registry's 52-count and the classify-by-layer's broader catch. The artifact correctly follows classify-by-layer.

### MINOR-3: S-09 Threshold Adjustment Detail
The council verdict CF-03 specifies the adjusted S-09 threshold as "<=150px total stacked gap instead of <=96px per-property." The artifact at line 223-226 uses "<=120px total stacked gap" as the ceiling value, which matches the registry items (ITEM 28, ITEM 41) but differs from the council's "<=150px" figure. The artifact's PT-03 council amendment note (line 227) says "adjusted from per-property (<=96px) to TOTAL STACKED measurement" without specifying the 150px figure.

**Severity:** MINOR. The 120px figure comes from the registry items (8+ reports confirm) while 150px appears only in the council verdict's CF-03 resolution text. The artifact reasonably follows the evidence-backed registry figure rather than the council's looser figure. This may be intentional (the council may have been setting a generous outer bound while the artifact uses the research-validated threshold). Worth flagging for the artifact author to confirm intent.

## Verdict: **PASS**

All 33 Layer 1 IDENTITY items: PRESENT (33/33)
All 52 Layer 2 PERCEPTION items: PRESENT (52/52)
Council verdict amendments: ALL APPLIED
Issues: 3 MINOR (taxonomy gap, supplementary items, threshold detail)

The artifact is ready for use. The three minor issues do not affect correctness or completeness. No blocking issues.

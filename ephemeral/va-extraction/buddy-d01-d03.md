## DETAILED VERIFICATION

### Diagram 1 (Items 1-80, VA Lines 7-221)

Verified line-by-line against source:

- **Items 1-3** (Pipeline name, master equation, zero-factor warning): Exact match to lines 11-14. Types (VALUE, DECISION, WARNING) are appropriate.
- **Items 4-14** (Phase 0 content analysis): All 6 analyst tasks (classify, map heterogeneity, assess metaphor, per-section character, density arc, reader model) correctly extracted from lines 18-36. Output spec (CONTENT MAP ~30-50 lines) and design-vs-content distinction captured.
- **Items 15-47** (Phase 1 activation brief): All 4 tiers extracted with correct line counts. Tier 1 (15L, 10 soul constraints, world-description voice, CSS values), Tier 2 (8L, 4 thresholds), Tier 3 (50L, 6 subsections A-F with line counts), Tier 4 (8 disposition instructions D-01 through D-08 including 3 marked NEW). Content map appendage captured.
- **Items 48-68** (Phase 2 building): Agent 3 as Opus NON-NEGOTIABLE, all 5 inputs correctly listed, all 4 "does NOT receive" items correctly extracted with suppressor references (S-02, S-18). Full 8-step build process with 3 self-evaluation points. Output spec (800-1200 CSS lines) captured.
- **Items 69-76** (Phase 3 perceptual audit): Screenshot protocol (3 viewports), 9 PA auditors with correct question assignments (Q1-6 through Q49-54), integrative auditor (Agent 14, Opus, pure gestalt), weaver (Agent 15, Opus, reads all 10 reports). All correct.
- **Items 77-80** (Verdict system): SHIP (>=3.5, zero soul violations), REFINE (2.5-3.5, different Opus, reads conviction), REBUILD (<2.5, fresh builder, COMPOSING mode). Return-to-Phase-2 with generative language correctly captured.

### Diagram 2 (Items 81-126, VA Lines 225-270)

Verified all 23 paired comparisons (old vs new pipeline):

- **Items 81-82**: PA-05 score ranges (1.5-3.5 old, 3.5-4.0 target). Correct.
- **Items 83-84**: Spec lines (963 old, ~113 new). Correct.
- **Items 85-86**: Guardrail ratios (7.9:1 old, 0.3:1 new). Correct.
- **Items 87-88**: Constraint counts (55 prohibitions old, 10 soul constraints new). Correct.
- **Items 89-90**: Format (checklist old, recipe + disposition new). Correct.
- **Items 91-92**: Voice ("Verify/Fail if/Must be" old, "This world IS / You ARE" new). Correct.
- **Items 93-94**: Agent counts (19-34 old, 12-15 new). Correct.
- **Items 95-96**: Structure (hierarchical old, flat new). Correct.
- **Items 97-98**: Build passes (multi-pass 3-5 old, single self-evaluating new). Correct.
- **Items 99-100**: Builder model (Sonnet old, Opus non-negotiable new). Correct.
- **Items 101-102**: Playwright access (zero old, builder HAS new). Correct.
- **Items 103-104**: Compression (83:1 old, 10:1 regeneration new). Correct.
- **Items 105-106**: TC brief (99-line with hex old, ~35-line routing only new). Correct.
- **Items 107-108**: CSS value generation (TC without perception old, builder with perception new). Correct.
- **Items 109-110**: Fix strategy (fix cycles old, rebuild with fresh builder new). Correct.
- **Items 111-112**: Builder mode (same in REPAIR old, fresh in COMPOSING new). Correct.
- **Items 113-114**: Language (diagnostic old, generative/artistic new). Correct.
- **Items 115-116**: Suppressor activation (S-11 + S-20 active old, zero new). Correct.
- **Items 117-118**: Total suppressors (20 active old, 0 new). Correct.
- **Items 119-120**: Gate visibility (builder sees gates old, frameworks only new). Correct.
- **Items 121-122**: Gate placement (builder prompt old, orchestrator only new). Correct.
- **Items 123-124**: Optimization target (gates old, quality new). Correct.
- **Items 125-126**: Result summary (right vocab wrong mode old, composing not complying new). Correct.

### Diagram 3 (Items 127-149, VA Lines 274-358)

Verified against full funnel structure:

- **Items 127-136** (Preconditions): All 3 preconditions correctly extracted with master equation factor mappings (Agent Capability, Content Affordance, Specification Fidelity) and pipeline enforcement points (Phase 2 model selection, Phase 0 content analysis, 73-line brief format).
- **Items 137-142** (Gatekeeper): COMPOSING mode with all 5 determinants (recipe format, 8 dispositional instructions, 80/20 creative authority, world-description voice, sub-200 line brief). Correct.
- **Items 143-146** (Capabilities): Both capabilities (Compositional Fluency, Peak-Valley Rhythm) extracted with details. CCS range (0.15-0.80) extracted as separate THRESHOLD item. EMERGENT property captured.
- **Items 147-149** (Output quality tiers): Floor (2.5-3.0), Ceiling (3.0-3.5), Flagship (3.5-4.0) with correct descriptors. Flagship's "unified metaphor throughout" captured.

## TYPE CLASSIFICATION AUDIT

Spot-checked 20 items for type correctness:
- AGENT_ROLE used for all agent specifications (Items 6, 16, 49, 72-76): Correct.
- FILE_REF used for builder inputs (Items 50-54): Correct.
- THRESHOLD used for numeric limits (Items 22-23, 26-29, 82, 128, 131, 134, 142, 144, 147-149): Correct.
- WARNING used sparingly for risk items (Items 3, 115): Correct.
- DECISION used for architectural choices: Correct throughout.

## VERDICT: PERFECT EXTRACTION

Zero issues found. All 149 items verified against source. Every actionable line in Diagrams 1-3 of the Visual Architecture is represented in the extraction. Line ranges are accurate. Types are correctly assigned. No MISSED, SUMMARIZED, COMBINED, MISTYPED, or MISQUOTED items detected.

The extraction is thorough and accurate, with good granularity — individual threshold values are broken into separate items (e.g., the 4 perception thresholds as Items 26-29), paired comparisons in Diagram 2 are extracted as separate old/new items, and the Diagram 3 funnel levels are correctly mapped to master equation factors.

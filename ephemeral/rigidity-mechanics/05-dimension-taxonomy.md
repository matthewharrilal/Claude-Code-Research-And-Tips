# Gravitational Pull Dimension Taxonomy
## Complete Map of All Rigidity Manifestation Vectors

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Researcher:** rigidity-mechanics-05
**Task:** Map every dimension where accumulated pattern gravity can manifest
**Team:** rigidity-mechanics (Task #5)
**Method:** Metacognitive analysis of design system + agent pipeline context

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Core Finding:** Gravitational pull operates across **18 distinct dimensions**, organized into 6 meta-categories. The 10 dimensions provided were a strong start but missed 8 critical vectors — particularly **load-order gravity**, **skill-proximity gravity**, **compression-ratio gravity**, and **validation-signal gravity**.

**Key Insight:** The most dangerous gravity is INVISIBLE gravity. Dimensions like "what's NOT documented" and "what loads first" create pull WITHOUT explicit instruction. These are harder to counteract than prescriptive pattern catalogs.

**Addressability:** 12/18 dimensions are addressable through architectural changes (gradient loading, framing shifts, diversity tracking). 6/18 are inherent (first-mover advantage, success validation, compression economics, tool inertia).

---

## METHODOLOGY

**Sources analyzed:**
1. `/Users/spacewizardmoneygang/Desktop/Claude-Research-And-Tips/ephemeral/true-extraction-inventory/07-synthesis.md` (inventory of extractables)
2. `/Users/spacewizardmoneygang/Desktop/Claude-Research-And-Tips/ephemeral/extraction-architecture/06-synthesis-blueprint.md` (gradient architecture)
3. `/Users/spacewizardmoneygang/Desktop/Claude-Research-And-Tips/design-system/pipeline/08-COMPOSITIONAL-STRATEGY-LIBRARY.md` (component + pattern library)

**Approach:**
1. Read provided 10 dimensions
2. Read reference files for concrete examples from our system
3. Identify missing dimensions via gap analysis
4. Rate gravity strength (Low/Medium/High)
5. Identify compounding relationships
6. Assess addressability (addressable vs inherent)

---

## META-CATEGORIES (6 Total)

The 18 dimensions organize into 6 meta-categories:

1. **TEMPORAL** (4 dimensions) — When gravity engages in the creative process
2. **SPATIAL** (3 dimensions) — Where in context gravity originates
3. **VOLUMETRIC** (3 dimensions) — How much material creates gravity
4. **RELATIONAL** (3 dimensions) — How patterns connect to each other
5. **SEMANTIC** (3 dimensions) — How meaning is encoded in patterns
6. **INVISIBLE** (2 dimensions) — Gravity from ABSENCE not PRESENCE

---

## DIMENSION INVENTORY (18 Total)

---

### META-CATEGORY 1: TEMPORAL GRAVITY (4 Dimensions)

Dimensions related to WHEN in the creative process gravitational pull engages.

---

#### **T1. TEMPORAL LOAD-ORDER** ⚠️ NEW — Not in original 10

**Definition:** Patterns loaded EARLY in agent context have higher gravity than patterns loaded LATE, even if all other factors are equal. First information anchors subsequent reasoning.

**Concrete Example:**
If Tier 3 case studies (geological, narrative, hub-spoke) load in Phase 0 (before content analysis), agents will pattern-match during tension derivation. If they load in Phase 3.5 (after metaphor candidates generated), they can only validate/refine, not replace.

From gradient architecture: "Examples can't bias decisions because they're not visible during decision-making phases."

**Gravity Strength:** **HIGH**

**Compounding With:**
- T2 (Pre-creative): First information in pre-creative phase has MAXIMUM gravity
- S2 (Mid-context positioning): Early context + mid-context visibility = reinforcing
- I1 (Gap gravity): Patterns loaded early DEFINE what gaps are visible

**Addressable?** **YES — Phase-gated loading**
Solution: Load Tier 1+2 (tools) in Phase 0. Load Tier 3 (examples) ONLY in Phase 3.5 after independent derivation. This is the gradient architecture's core mechanism.

---

#### **T2. PRE-CREATIVE / MID-CREATIVE / POST-CREATIVE** (Original #1)

**Definition:** Gravity engages differently at three moments:
- **Pre-creative:** Planning/scoping — gravity from documented track splits, pattern catalogs seen before content analysis
- **Mid-creative:** Composition — gravity from patterns visible during metaphor search
- **Post-creative:** Review/validation — gravity from success signals ("top 3 unchanged")

**Concrete Example:**
Pre-creative gravity: Agent reads library, sees "geological confidence stratification" BEFORE analyzing content → during content analysis, sees "certainty gradients" and immediately pattern-matches to geological.

Mid-creative gravity: Agent derives tension, generates 3 candidates, THEN sees 6 existing patterns → "geological already exists" becomes easier path than "invent novel metaphor."

Post-creative gravity: Agent audits 15 layouts, marks "Playbook Elevation Map" as top quality → future builders perceive elevation pattern as validated/safe choice.

**Gravity Strength:** **HIGH** (all three phases)

**Compounding With:**
- T1 (Load-order): Pre-creative gravity is STRONGEST when patterns load early
- V3 (Success signal): Post-creative validation creates gravity for future pre-creative phases
- S5 (Authority): Patterns from "crown jewel" explorations have higher pre-creative gravity

**Addressable?**
- **Pre-creative:** YES — delay pattern catalog visibility until Phase 3.5
- **Mid-creative:** PARTIAL — can reduce via framing (narrative not recipe)
- **Post-creative:** INHERENT — validation creates value, but value creates gravity

---

#### **T3. FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE** (Original #7 — Historical)

**Definition:** Earlier-documented patterns have more gravity than recent ones, even if recent patterns are superior. First-documented patterns establish conceptual territory that later patterns must work around.

**Concrete Example:**
DD-001 through DD-006 were the FIRST explorations (May 2024). Six months later, OD-001 through OD-006 arrived (Nov 2024), then AD/CD (Feb 2025). Memory.md shows: "DD-006-fractal.html is the most-referenced artifact (20+ inbound refs)."

DD-006 fractal pattern isn't more VALUABLE than CD-006 crown jewel, but it has MORE gravity because it was FIRST. It defined "what fractal self-similarity looks like" before other patterns could offer alternatives.

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Compounding With:**
- S1 (Early context): First-documented patterns often appear early in file structures
- T2 (Pre-creative): First patterns seen during research become anchor points
- R2 (Cross-reference): First patterns accumulate more inbound references over time

**Addressable?** **PARTIALLY — Temporal equity via curation**
Can't erase history, but can counteract via:
1. Shuffle pattern presentation order (don't always show DD first)
2. Highlight recent innovations explicitly ("CD-006 introduces NEW combination grammar")
3. Diversity tracking flags over-used EARLY patterns same as over-used recent ones

---

#### **T4. FREQUENCY-OVER-TIME** ⚠️ NEW — Not in original 10

**Definition:** Patterns used repeatedly across MULTIPLE explorations (not just one) accumulate temporal gravity. A pattern used in DD-002, OD-004, AD-003, and CD-006 has more gravity than a pattern used only in CD-005.

**Concrete Example:**
From strategy library: "Callout system appears in 38/39 exploration files." This isn't just volumetric (how many lines) — it's TEMPORAL. Callouts appeared in EVERY phase (DD, OD, AD, CD) across 8 months of work. They're not just big, they're PROVEN.

Contrast: Bento grid appears in AD-003, CD-005, CD-006 (3 files, 2 months). It's validated but not temporally pervasive. Builders will default to callouts (8-month track record) over bento (2-month track record) even if bento is better for the content.

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM**

**Compounding With:**
- T3 (First-mover): First patterns have more TIME to accumulate frequency
- V3 (Success signal): Frequent patterns perceived as validated
- R1 (Usage count): Frequency ≈ usage count, but temporal spread adds weight

**Addressable?** **YES — Separate "proven" from "pervasive"**
Solution: Track "# of phases pattern appears in" separately from "# of total files." A pattern in ALL 4 phases (DD/OD/AD/CD) but only 4 files total is DIFFERENT from a pattern in 1 phase but 20 files. Highlight phase-diversity separately from volume.

---

### META-CATEGORY 2: SPATIAL GRAVITY (3 Dimensions)

Dimensions related to WHERE in agent context gravity originates.

---

#### **S1. EARLY / MID / LATE CONTEXT** (Original #2 — Spatial)

**Definition:** Patterns appearing in EARLY context (skill loading, first files read) have more gravity than patterns in LATE context (supplemental references, optional reading).

**Concrete Example:**
From gradient architecture: "Tier 1+2 (Always Load): READ tier-1/tokens.css, tier-2/*.css. You now have: tools + constraints. TIER 2 (Do NOT Load Yet): DO NOT read tier-3/case-studies/*.md until Phase 3.5."

Tier 1+2 = EARLY context → high gravity. Agents will compose using these tools because they're always present.
Tier 3 = LATE context (Phase 3.5 onward) → lower gravity. Agents have already sketched solutions before seeing examples.

**Gravity Strength:** **HIGH**

**Compounding With:**
- T1 (Load-order): Early context = early load-order, double gravity
- T2 (Pre-creative): Early context materials shape pre-creative planning
- V1 (Total volume): High volume in early context = maximum gravity

**Addressable?** **YES — Gradient loading architecture**
This is THE solution from extraction-architecture research: "Examples invisible during derivation, visible during validation."

---

#### **S2. SKILL-PROXIMITY** ⚠️ NEW — Not in original 10

**Definition:** Patterns embedded IN the skill file (`~/.claude/skills/tension-composition/SKILL.md`) have more gravity than patterns in external library files, even if both are loaded. The skill is the INSTRUCTION SET; its contents carry procedural weight.

**Concrete Example:**
Current skill (839 lines) contains Phase 3.4 metaphor search query construction, Phase 4.2 translation grammar (6 CSS channels), Phase 4.0 guardrail gates. These are BAKED into procedure.

If we ADD "geological strata recipe" to the skill file (inside Phase 4 guidance), it becomes PROCEDURAL instruction not OPTIONAL reference. Agents will treat it as "step to follow" not "example to consider."

**Gravity Strength:** **HIGH** (skill proximity > library proximity)

**Compounding With:**
- S1 (Early context): Skill files often loaded early
- T2 (Pre-creative): Skill instructions shape entire creative process
- F1 (Prescriptive framing): Skill language is inherently prescriptive ("Phase X: DO this")

**Addressable?** **YES — Keep skill generic, library specific**
Solution: Skill contains PROCESS (how to derive tension, how to search, how to validate). Library contains EXAMPLES (geological worked for this content, hub-spoke worked for that). Never merge them.

From gradient architecture: "Skill protocol is pattern-agnostic. 839 lines, zero named-pattern references."

---

#### **S3. PROXIMITY-TO-CURRENT-TASK** (Original #10 — Contextual Proximity)

**Definition:** Patterns loaded NEAR the creative prompt (immediately before composition) have more gravity than patterns loaded FAR from it (loaded hours ago, many compactions back).

**Concrete Example:**
Agent session flow:
1. Hour 0: Load full library (Tier 1+2+3, all 2,365 lines)
2. Hour 1: Analyze content, derive tension
3. Hour 2: Context compaction (library shrinks to summary)
4. Hour 3: Generate metaphor candidates → geological is NO LONGER in context
5. Hour 4: Phase 3.5 loads geological case study → NOW in context, near composition

Geological has MORE gravity at Hour 4 (proximity to composition) than at Hour 0 (proximity to session start).

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Compounding With:**
- T1 (Load-order): Recent load = near current task
- S1 (Early context): Far from task = low gravity, even if early in session
- M1 (Context window): Compaction removes distant material, keeps proximate material

**Addressable?** **PARTIALLY — Can't control compaction, can control WHEN to load**
Solution: Load examples (Tier 3) ONLY when needed (Phase 3.5), not at session start. This ensures they're PROXIMATE to composition decision, not distant and compacted away.

---

### META-CATEGORY 3: VOLUMETRIC GRAVITY (3 Dimensions)

Dimensions related to HOW MUCH material creates gravitational pull.

---

#### **V1. TOTAL VOLUME** (Original #4 — Volumetric)

**Definition:** 100 lines on ONE pattern creates more gravity than 10 lines on 10 patterns, even if total volume is equal (100 lines). Concentrated volume > distributed volume.

**Concrete Example:**
From strategy library Tier 3 recipes:
- Geological stratification: 150 lines (complete recipe, fractal application, DO NOTs, mechanisms)
- Editorial synthesis: 150 lines
- Hub-spoke spatial: 150 lines

VS from Tier 2.5:
- Bento grid CSS: 25 lines + 110 lines guidance = 135 lines
- Solid offset CSS: 15 lines + 80 lines guidance = 95 lines
- Drop cap CSS: 10 lines + 60 lines guidance = 70 lines

Geological (150 concentrated) has MORE gravity than drop cap (70 distributed across CSS + guidance). Agents spend more time reading geological, more details stick.

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM**

**Compounding With:**
- S1 (Early context): Large volume early = high gravity
- F2 (Specificity): Large volume enables high specificity (more details = more guidance)
- V3 (Success signal): Large documentation volume implies importance/validation

**Addressable?** **YES — Volume caps per tier**
From gradient architecture: "Volume distributed across tiers, never exceeding threshold in any single tier." Cap: Tier 3 case studies max 150 lines each. Forces concision, prevents any single pattern dominating via volume.

---

#### **V2. COMPRESSION-RATIO** ⚠️ NEW — Not in original 10

**Definition:** Patterns that achieve HIGH visual richness with LOW documentation volume create "efficiency gravity" — they appear cost-effective, making them more attractive than patterns requiring extensive explanation.

**Concrete Example:**
From tension-test findings (MEMORY.md): "Pipeline predicts RICHNESS not QUALITY. Key insight: IMPLICIT > EXPLICIT metaphors."

Top 3 layouts (Playbook Elevation Map, Gas Town Floor Plan, Boris Geological Core) all used IMPLICIT metaphors. The metaphor vocabulary wasn't labeled everywhere. This means:
- Less CSS (no `.bedrock-label`, `.strata-marker` everywhere)
- Less HTML (no wrapper divs with metaphor classes)
- Less documentation needed (metaphor emerges from composition, not classes)

Builders perceive implicit patterns as "elegant" and "economical." But compression creates gravity: "This pattern works WITHOUT heavy documentation, so it must be good."

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM**

**Compounding With:**
- F2 (Specificity): High compression = low specificity, feels more flexible
- V1 (Total volume): Low volume = attractive (less to read/implement)
- Economic pressure: Track 2 is 3-5h per page; compression = speed

**Addressable?** **INHERENT — Compression is quality signal**
Compression ISN'T bad gravity. It's GOOD design (elegance, economy). But it creates pattern preference even when verbose patterns might serve content better. Can acknowledge ("compressed patterns have gravity") but shouldn't counteract.

---

#### **V3. SUCCESS-SIGNAL VOLUME** (Original #10 — Success Signal)

**Definition:** Patterns marked as "validated," "tested," "crown jewel," or from "top 3" explorations create gravity via SUCCESS labeling, not just documentation volume.

**Concrete Example:**
From MEMORY.md: "Crown jewel CD-006: 39/40 TARGET MET. Top 3 unchanged: Playbook Elevation Map, Gas Town Floor Plan, Boris Geological Core."

CD-006 has SUCCESS signal. Future builders see "crown jewel" and "39/40 score" → high gravity. Even if CD-005 has EQUAL quality (38/40), it lacks "crown jewel" label → lower gravity.

Similarly, "top 3 unchanged" means elevation, floor plan, and geological carry VALIDATION gravity. Post-fix audit marked them as STABLE quality → they're SAFE choices.

**Gravity Strength:** **HIGH**

**Compounding With:**
- T2 (Post-creative): Validation IS post-creative gravity
- T3 (First-mover): Early patterns often validated first, accumulate success signals
- V1 (Volume): Success-validated patterns often documented more thoroughly

**Addressable?** **INHERENT — Validation creates value, value creates gravity**
Can't avoid validation (quality control is necessary). Can mitigate by:
1. Validate patterns from ALL phases (not just early ones)
2. Highlight RECENT validations explicitly ("CD-006 crown jewel, Feb 2025")
3. Separate "quality" from "track record" (new pattern can be high-quality without long history)

---

### META-CATEGORY 4: RELATIONAL GRAVITY (3 Dimensions)

Dimensions related to HOW patterns connect to each other.

---

#### **R1. USAGE-COUNT CROSS-REFERENCE** (Original #5 — Relational)

**Definition:** Patterns referenced by OTHER patterns accumulate gravity via inbound references. The more cross-references, the more central the pattern appears.

**Concrete Example:**
From MEMORY.md: "DD-006-fractal.html is the most-referenced artifact (20+ inbound refs)."

DD-006 fractal appears in:
- R3-023 (fractal self-similarity)
- R3-036 disambiguation note (clarifies fractal vs crescendo)
- Multiple OD/AD explorations referencing 2-zone DNA
- Tension-composition skill (fractal application guidance)

20+ inbound references make DD-006 THE central node. When builders search for "fractal" or "self-similarity" or "2-zone DNA," all roads lead to DD-006. This creates DEFAULT status via network centrality.

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Compounding With:**
- T3 (First-mover): First patterns accumulate references over time
- V3 (Success signal): High-quality patterns get referenced more
- R2 (Circular validation): Cross-references create mutual reinforcement

**Addressable?** **PARTIALLY — Track reference diversity**
Can't prevent valuable patterns from being referenced. Can track OVER-reference and add advisory flags:
- "DD-006 has 20+ inbound refs — consider whether your content truly needs fractal or if another pattern serves better"
- Weaver maintains reference count, flags at 4× usage threshold

---

#### **R2. CIRCULAR VALIDATION** ⚠️ NEW — Not in original 10

**Definition:** When Pattern A references Pattern B as "similar approach" and Pattern B references Pattern A as "related technique," they create CIRCULAR validation gravity — mutual reinforcement that makes both appear more established than they are.

**Concrete Example:**
From strategy library:
- Geological stratification recipe: "Other metaphors that could work: Botanical (growth rings), Architectural (foundation layers)"
- Architectural foundation recipe (hypothetical): "Other metaphors that could work: Geological (sedimentary layers), Editorial (draft stages)"

These reciprocal references create circular validation. A builder researching "layered confidence" finds BOTH patterns pointing to each other → "Two patterns agree this is the right approach" → reinforced gravity.

**Gravity Strength:** **LOW-MEDIUM** (subtle but real)

**Compounding With:**
- R1 (Cross-reference): Circular refs ARE cross-refs, compound citation count
- F1 (Prescriptive): "Other metaphors" lists feel prescriptive ("these are the options")
- C1 (Completeness): Circular refs create illusion that territory is fully mapped

**Addressable?** **YES — Asymmetric referencing + "non-exhaustive" flags**
Solutions:
1. Pattern A can reference B, but B should reference C/D/E (not A) → breaks circles
2. Add "non-exhaustive" flags: "Other metaphors that HAVE worked (not exhaustive list)"
3. Explicitly encourage divergence: "These are examples, not boundaries"

---

#### **R3. DEPENDENCY CHAINS** ⚠️ NEW — Not in original 10

**Definition:** Patterns that are PREREQUISITES for other patterns create gravity via dependency. "To use Pattern B, you must understand Pattern A first" → Pattern A has structural gravity.

**Concrete Example:**
From strategy library Tier structure:
- Tier 3 patterns (geological, hub-spoke, bento islands) ALL reference Tier 2.5 mechanisms
- Tier 2.5 mechanisms (bento grid, confidence encoding) ALL reference Tier 2 components
- Tier 2 components (callouts, code blocks) ALL reference Tier 1 tokens

Dependency chain: Tier 3 → Tier 2.5 → Tier 2 → Tier 1

This means Tier 1 has MAXIMUM dependency gravity. Every pattern in the system requires tokens. Builders must load tokens FIRST, reinforcing their centrality.

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM** (structural, not creative)

**Compounding With:**
- S1 (Early context): Prerequisites loaded early
- T1 (Load-order): Dependencies define load order
- V1 (Volume): Prerequisites often have concentrated documentation (tokens doc)

**Addressable?** **INHERENT — Dependency is architectural necessity**
Can't eliminate dependencies (architectural layers require them). Can acknowledge: "Tier 1 has structural gravity because it's the foundation. This is CORRECT gravity (not bias)."

---

### META-CATEGORY 5: SEMANTIC GRAVITY (3 Dimensions)

Dimensions related to HOW meaning is encoded in patterns.

---

#### **F1. FRAMING (PRESCRIPTIVE VS DESCRIPTIVE VS NARRATIVE)** (Original #3 — Framing)

**Definition:** HOW a pattern is written creates different gravity. Prescriptive framing ("DO this") creates more gravity than descriptive ("this happened") or narrative ("here's the story").

**Concrete Example:**
From extraction-architecture (gradient architecture solution):

**OLD (prescriptive):**
```
**When to use:** Content has certainty gradients
**DO NOT:** Use outside geological contexts
**Composition recipe:** [8 steps]
```

**NEW (narrative):**
```
⚠️ READ THIS FIRST: This is NOT a template.
**The tension that existed:** [story]
**The search that happened:** [process]
**Why THIS answer worked:** [mechanisms]
**What YOU extract:** [tools, not templates]
**Your assignment:** Derive YOUR answer.
```

Same information (geological strata pattern), different framing. Prescriptive → feels like instruction. Narrative → feels like case study. Narrative has LOWER gravity.

**Gravity Strength:** **HIGH** (framing = permission structure)

**Compounding With:**
- S2 (Skill proximity): Skill language is inherently prescriptive ("Phase X: DO this")
- F2 (Specificity): Prescriptive language enables high specificity
- V1 (Volume): Prescriptive recipes are longer (more steps)

**Addressable?** **YES — Rewrite case studies in narrative format**
From gradient architecture Phase C Session 4: "Rewrite 6 case studies in narrative format (~1,500 lines). Template: Research #3 complete format." PLANNED FIX.

---

#### **F2. SPECIFICITY (EXACT VALUES VS PRINCIPLES)** (Original #9 — Specificity)

**Definition:** Highly-specified patterns (exact CSS values, specific px measurements) create more gravity than principle-level patterns ("use gestalt spacing for rhythm"). Specificity = apparent certainty.

**Concrete Example:**
From strategy library geological recipe:
```
Padding inverse to confidence:
- Established (4px border): 40px padding (var(--space-10))
- Probable (3px border): 32px padding (var(--space-8))
- Speculative (2px border): 24px padding (var(--space-6))
- Open (1px border): 16px padding (var(--space-4))
```

This is HIGHLY specific. 4px → 40px, 3px → 32px, exact values. Compare to principle version:
```
Padding inverse to confidence: More certain = more breathing room.
```

Specific version has MORE gravity because it removes judgment calls. Builders can copy values directly. Principle version requires INTERPRETATION → higher friction → lower adoption gravity.

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Compounding With:**
- F1 (Prescriptive): Specific values + prescriptive framing = maximum instruction
- V1 (Volume): Specific documentation is longer (more values listed)
- Economic pressure: Specificity = speed (no judgment calls)

**Addressable?** **PARTIALLY — Separate mechanism from application**
Solution from gradient architecture: "Extract MECHANISMS (border-weight gradient) not RECIPES (4px=40px). Document that geological USED 4px=40px, but hub-spoke could use 3px=60px."

Keep specificity in case studies (evidence), remove from general guidance (principles).

---

#### **F3. NAMING GRAVITY** ⚠️ NEW — Not in original 10

**Definition:** The NAME of a pattern constrains its conceptual space. "Geological confidence stratification" can ONLY be used for geological metaphors in builders' minds, even if the MECHANISM (border-weight gradient) is universal.

**Concrete Example:**
From strategy library:
- Pattern name: "Geological Confidence Stratification"
- Mechanism name: "Border-Weight Gradient" (Tier 2.5)
- Actual applications: geological (OD-004), scientific findings (research docs), decision logs (confidence levels)

The MECHANISM works for ANY graded confidence context. But the PATTERN NAME creates gravity: "My content isn't geological, so I can't use this."

Contrast: "Border-Weight Gradient" (mechanism name) doesn't constrain application domain. Builders can apply to ANY context where hierarchy encodes importance.

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM**

**Compounding With:**
- F1 (Framing): Metaphor-specific names + prescriptive framing = "must match domain"
- C2 (Categorical labels): Pattern names are CATEGORIES
- S2 (Skill proximity): Named patterns in skill create procedural association

**Addressable?** **YES — Generic mechanism names, specific case study names**
Solution from strategy library structure:
- Tier 2.5: "Border-Weight Gradient" (generic, reusable)
- Tier 3: "Geological Confidence Stratification" (specific case study)

Builders search mechanisms (generic), not case studies (specific). Naming reflects this.

---

### META-CATEGORY 6: INVISIBLE GRAVITY (2 Dimensions)

Dimensions where gravity comes from ABSENCE, not PRESENCE — what's NOT documented.

---

#### **I1. GAP GRAVITY (IMPLICIT BOUNDARIES)** (Original #10 — Implicit vs Explicit)

**Definition:** Gravity from what's NOT documented. If all documented patterns are text-heavy/narrative, builders perceive "data-heavy content doesn't belong here" even if no rule says that. Documented territory defines BOUNDARIES.

**Concrete Example:**
From strategy library Tier 3 patterns:
- Geological (prose-heavy research findings)
- Narrative crescendo (tutorial/getting-started)
- Hub-spoke (conceptual overviews)
- Bento islands (task documentation)
- Editorial synthesis (essay-length content)
- Compound sequential (multi-phase workflows)

All 6 patterns are PROSE contexts. ZERO patterns documented for:
- Data tables (reference documentation)
- API specifications (technical parameters)
- Version changelogs (structured lists)
- Installation matrices (OS × version grids)

Gap gravity: Builders perceive "Track 2 is for narrative content, Track 1 is for data/technical." This wasn't STATED, but the gap IMPLIES it.

**Gravity Strength:** **HIGH** (invisible boundaries are strongest)

**Compounding With:**
- C1 (Completeness): A "complete" library with gaps implies "that's not our territory"
- F1 (Framing): Documented patterns define "what this system is FOR"
- T2 (Pre-creative): Gaps shape initial pattern-matching ("no pattern for this? wrong track")

**Addressable?** **YES — Explicit gap acknowledgment + expansion invitations**
Solutions:
1. Document gaps: "These 6 patterns serve narrative content. Data-heavy patterns are NOT YET documented. Expand library via Track 2 experimentation on technical content."
2. Add "undocumented territory" section to library
3. Encourage divergence beyond documented patterns

---

#### **I2. AESTHETIC GRAVITY** (Original #10 — Aesthetic Gravity)

**Definition:** Documented visual consistency creates pressure toward similar aesthetics, even without explicit rules. If all validated explorations use muted colors, builders perceive "bright colors violate style" even if palette allows them.

**Concrete Example:**
From inventory synthesis: "45 universal tokens — Colors (14)":
```
--color-primary: #E83025 (KortAI red)
--color-background: #FEF9F5 (Warm cream)
--accent-blue: #4A90D9
--accent-green: #4A9B6B
--accent-coral: #C97065
--accent-amber: #D97706
--accent-purple: #7C3AED
```

Palette includes 5 accent colors (blue, green, coral, amber, purple). But from visual audits: callout usage patterns show:
- Blue (info) — 38/39 files
- Green (tip) — 35/39 files
- Coral (gotcha) — 30/39 files
- Amber (caution) — 25/39 files
- Purple (essence) — 20/39 files

Purple has LOWEST usage. Not because it's prohibited, but because existing explorations use blue/green/coral MORE. Builders perceive purple as "rare" → avoid it → reinforces rarity.

Aesthetic gravity: Visual consistency in examples creates IMPLICIT aesthetic rules.

**Gravity Strength:** **MEDIUM**

**Compounding With:**
- T3 (First-mover): Early explorations establish aesthetic baseline
- V3 (Success signal): Top 3 layouts define "what quality looks like"
- I1 (Gap gravity): Unused palette colors feel "not part of system"

**Addressable?** **PARTIALLY — Explicit permission + diversity showcasing**
Solutions:
1. Add to library: "Purple accent is UNDER-USED in existing explorations. This is historical artifact, not quality signal. Try purple for essence/archival contexts."
2. Build 1-2 explorations with purple-heavy palette to expand aesthetic range
3. Track aesthetic diversity same as metaphor diversity

---

## MISSING FROM ORIGINAL 10 (8 New Dimensions)

The original 10-dimension list was strong but missed:

1. **T1. Temporal Load-Order** — When patterns load determines gravity
2. **T4. Frequency-Over-Time** — Temporal spread across phases, not just volume
3. **S2. Skill-Proximity** — Patterns in skill file have procedural gravity
4. **V2. Compression-Ratio** — Efficient patterns (low doc volume, high output) create gravity
5. **R2. Circular Validation** — Patterns referencing each other create mutual reinforcement
6. **R3. Dependency Chains** — Prerequisites have structural gravity
7. **F3. Naming Gravity** — Pattern names constrain conceptual space
8. **I2. Aesthetic Gravity** — Visual consistency in examples creates implicit rules

These 8 dimensions are CRITICAL because they're INVISIBLE or STRUCTURAL (not content-based). They create gravity without appearing in documentation.

---

## COMPOUNDING MATRIX

How dimensions reinforce each other:

| Dimension Pair | How They Compound | Severity |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **T1 (Load-order) × S1 (Early context)** | Early load + early position = maximum pre-creative gravity | CRITICAL |
| **T2 (Pre-creative) × F1 (Prescriptive)** | Prescriptive patterns seen during planning = instruction not inspiration | HIGH |
| **T3 (First-mover) × R1 (Cross-ref)** | First patterns accumulate references over time = network centrality | HIGH |
| **V1 (Volume) × F2 (Specificity)** | Large volume enables high specificity = apparent certainty | MEDIUM |
| **V3 (Success signal) × T3 (First-mover)** | Early patterns validated first = permanent quality advantage | HIGH |
| **S2 (Skill proximity) × F1 (Prescriptive)** | Skill language is procedural = patterns in skill become steps | CRITICAL |
| **R1 (Cross-ref) × R2 (Circular)** | Mutual references create closed validation loops | MEDIUM |
| **F3 (Naming) × I1 (Gap gravity)** | Specific names + undocumented territory = implicit boundaries | HIGH |
| **I1 (Gap) × C1 (Completeness)** | "Complete" library with gaps = "don't go there" signal | CRITICAL |
| **I2 (Aesthetic) × V3 (Success signal)** | Top 3 layouts define visual standard = aesthetic homogenization | MEDIUM |

**Most dangerous combinations:**
1. T1 × S1 (Load-order + Early context) — Gradient architecture addresses this
2. S2 × F1 (Skill proximity + Prescriptive) — Keep skill generic, library specific
3. I1 × C1 (Gap + Completeness) — Explicit gap acknowledgment required

## ADDRESSABILITY ASSESSMENT

**12/18 Addressable** (architectural solutions exist):

| # | Dimension | Solution |
|---|-----------|----------|
| T1 | Load-order | Phase-gated loading (Tier 3 invisible until Phase 3.5) |
| T2 | Pre/Mid/Post creative | Delay examples to post-derivation phases |
| T3 | First-mover | Shuffle presentation order, highlight recent innovations |
| T4 | Frequency-over-time | Track phase-diversity separately from volume |
| S1 | Early/Mid/Late context | Gradient loading (tools early, examples late) |
| S2 | Skill-proximity | Keep skill generic, never embed specific patterns |
| S3 | Proximity-to-task | Load examples only when needed (Phase 3.5) |
| V1 | Total volume | Volume caps per tier (150 lines max per case study) |
| R1 | Cross-reference | Track reference counts, flag over-reference |
| R2 | Circular validation | Asymmetric referencing, non-exhaustive flags |
| F1 | Framing | Rewrite case studies in narrative format |
| F3 | Naming | Generic mechanism names (Tier 2.5), specific case names (Tier 3) |

**6/18 Inherent** (exist by nature of system):

| # | Dimension | Why Inherent | Mitigation |
|---|-----------|--------------|------------|
| V2 | Compression-ratio | Efficiency is quality signal | Acknowledge but don't counteract |
| V3 | Success-signal | Validation creates value | Validate patterns from all phases equally |
| R3 | Dependency chains | Architecture requires layers | Acknowledge correct vs bias gravity |
| F2 | Specificity | Examples need concrete details | Separate mechanism from application values |
| I1 | Gap gravity | Can't document everything | Explicit gap acknowledgment, expansion invitations |
| I2 | Aesthetic gravity | Examples establish visual norms | Permission + diversity showcasing |

## GRAVITY STRENGTH RANKINGS

**HIGH Gravity (7 dimensions):**
1. T1 — Load-order (INVISIBLE, architectural)
2. T2 — Pre-creative temporal (shapes entire process)
3. S1 — Early context spatial (first information anchors)
4. S2 — Skill-proximity (procedural weight)
5. V3 — Success-signal (validation creates preference)
6. F1 — Prescriptive framing ("DO this" = instruction)
7. I1 — Gap gravity (INVISIBLE boundaries)

**MEDIUM Gravity (8 dimensions):**
8. T3 — First-mover (temporal advantage)
9. T4 — Frequency-over-time (proven ≠ pervasive)
10. S3 — Proximity-to-task (recency effect)
11. V1 — Total volume (concentrated > distributed)
12. V2 — Compression-ratio (efficiency preference)
13. R1 — Cross-reference (network centrality)
14. F2 — Specificity (certainty > principle)
15. I2 — Aesthetic (visual consistency pressure)

**LOW Gravity (3 dimensions):**
16. R2 — Circular validation (subtle reinforcement)
17. R3 — Dependency chains (structural not creative)
18. F3 — Naming (constrains domain perception)

## STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### For Gradient Architecture Design

**CRITICAL fixes:**
1. **T1 + S1:** Phase-gated loading is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Examples invisible until Phase 3.5.
2. **S2:** Skill file MUST remain pattern-agnostic (currently is, maintain forever).
3. **I1:** Explicit gap documentation prevents invisible boundaries.

**HIGH-PRIORITY fixes:**
4. **F1:** Rewrite Tier 3 case studies in narrative format (planned Phase C Session 4).
5. **T2:** Strengthen "divergence expectation" language in skill protocol.
6. **V3:** Validate patterns from ALL phases, not just early ones.

### For Diversity Tracking

**Track these separately:**
1. Metaphor usage count (already planned)
2. Temporal spread (# of phases pattern appears in)
3. Reference count (inbound citations)
4. Aesthetic diversity (color palette usage, typography variation)

**Advisory flags at:**
- 4× usage threshold (metaphor)
- 20+ inbound refs (cross-reference)
- Single-phase concentration (temporal)
- <10% palette usage (aesthetic)

### For Library Evolution

**Expansion priorities:**
1. Fill gap gravity: Document data-heavy patterns (API specs, changelogs, tables)
2. Aesthetic expansion: Build explorations with under-used palette colors
3. Recent innovation highlighting: "CD-006 introduces NEW combination grammar"
4. Non-exhaustive language: "Other metaphors that HAVE worked (not exhaustive)"

## CONCLUSION

**18 dimensions identified** across 6 meta-categories:
- TEMPORAL (4): When gravity engages
- SPATIAL (3): Where gravity originates
- VOLUMETRIC (3): How much creates pull
- RELATIONAL (3): How patterns connect
- SEMANTIC (3): How meaning encodes gravity
- INVISIBLE (2): Gravity from absence

**12/18 addressable** via architectural changes (gradient loading, framing, curation).
**6/18 inherent** (efficiency, validation, dependencies, gaps).

**Most dangerous:** INVISIBLE gravity (load-order, skill-proximity, gap boundaries). These create pull WITHOUT explicit instruction — hardest to detect, hardest to counteract.

**The gradient architecture addresses 8/10 highest-gravity dimensions.** The remaining 2 (success-signal, prescriptive framing) are partially mitigated via narrative rewriting and validation equity.

**This taxonomy is complete.** Any additional dimensions would be SUB-CATEGORIES of these 18, not fundamentally new vectors.

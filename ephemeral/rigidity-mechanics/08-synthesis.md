**Research Base:** 7 files, 30,431 lines of analysis
**Purpose:** Resolve the gravitational pull concern comprehensively

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Question:** When agents are loaded with 45 tokens + 18 components + 12 mechanisms + 8 patterns and asked to create a page for NEW content with a NEW metaphor, will they default to known patterns rather than generating fresh compositions?

**The Answer:** **YES — but NOT because of volume. Pattern defaulting operates through TIMING (when patterns are consulted) and FRAMING (how they're positioned), not through information quantity.**

### The Core Finding

**Information volume does NOT cause defaulting. Information POSITIONING does.**

An agent with access to 1 pattern framed as "use this when X" will pattern-match.
An agent with access to 100 patterns framed as "proof gallery" consulted AFTER derivation will generate fresh.

**The decision point is NOT "how many patterns exist" but "am I in LOOKUP mode or SEARCH mode?"**

### The Critical Mechanisms

1. **Continuation Bias** — LLMs extend prompts rather than override them; first-read material becomes anchor
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** — High-similarity matches surface first, condition generation
3. **Gravity Cliff at Patterns** — 0% gravity (tokens) → 75-80% gravity (patterns), vertical transition
4. **The 3-Example Sweet Spot** — Empirically proven optimal exposure (analogous domains research)
5. **Binary Rules Achieve 100% Compliance** — From MEMORY.md metacognition finding
6. **Charlie Parker's Method** — Learn deeply, then forget during performance

## 1. THE PROBLEM (Deeply Understood)

### 1.1 What Gravitational Pull IS

**Gravitational pull is the phenomenon where accumulated creative knowledge creates preference toward known solutions over novel generation.**

In this specific context:
- **Known patterns** = 8 compositional explorations (PULSE, ISLANDS, GEOLOGICAL, etc.) with documented structures, mechanisms, and "when to use" criteria
- **Novel generation** = Deriving fresh metaphors from content tension, even when similar tensions have been resolved before
- **Defaulting** = Using library patterns as templates rather than deriving independent solutions

**The manifestation:**

When an agent:
1. Reads content with warmth/austerity tension
2. Sees library pattern "Geological Stratification — When to use: content has certainty gradients"
3. Matches "certainty gradients" to content characteristics
4. Adapts geological pattern to new content

**This is pattern-matching, not tension-deriving.**

The agent took a KNOWN SOLUTION and APPLIED it, rather than DERIVING a solution from content properties.

### 1.2 Why Growth Creates Gravity

**The Spectrum Mechanism:**

Gravity is NOT linear. It's a CLIFF at the pattern layer.

```
Gravity (constraint on creative output)
100% │                                    ┌─── Compositions
     │                                   /

     │                             /
 60% │                        ┌──/
     │                       /    PATTERNS ← THE CLIFF
 40% │                  ┌──/
     │             ┌───/
 20% │        ┌──/
     │    ┌─/  Mechanisms (pattern-specific)
  0% │───┘
     └──────────────────────────────────────────
       Tokens  Components  Mechanisms  Patterns  Compositions
                          (universal)
```

**The progression:**

| Layer | Gravity % | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **Tokens (45)** | 0% | Pure vocabulary — choosing `#E83025` doesn't constrain layout |
| **Components (18)** | 10-20% | Default structures (2-zone callouts) but parameterizable |
| **Universal Mechanisms (5)** | 80-95% | Conventions (3-category borders) but productive — they're grammar rules |
| **Pattern-Specific Mechanisms (7)** | 30-50% | Optional techniques (spacing compression) — context-dependent |
| **Patterns (8)** | 75-80% | **METAPHOR IS THE PATTERN** — choosing pattern = committing to architecture |
| **Compositions (∞)** | 100% | Unique outputs — can't extract, only document process |

**The gravity cliff:** Transition from mechanisms (30-50% constraint) to patterns (75-80% constraint) is VERTICAL.

**Why patterns have extreme gravity:**

Patterns are NOT reusable vocabulary. Patterns are DECISIONS.

Example from Boris content (5 metaphors tested):
- **Geological Core:** 6 strata (Surface → Bedrock), depth gradient, geological vocabulary
- **Manuscript Codex:** 11 parts (I-XI), manuscript provenance, linear structure
- **Apprentice Curriculum:** 7 lessons, numbered objectives, curriculum vocabulary

**SAME content, DIFFERENT architectures** — 75-80% of each file is metaphor-generated.

The pattern doesn't just SUGGEST structure — it DICTATES structure. The metaphor shapes the page.

### 1.3 Why Restricting Access Doesn't Work

**The volume hypothesis: "More patterns = more gravity, so restrict pattern count"**

**This hypothesis is WRONG.**

From cognitive mechanics research:

> **VOLUME is irrelevant below perception threshold.**
> **FRAMING becomes deterministic at first exposure.**

Evidence:
- Tension-composition skill (839 lines, zero named patterns) produces novel metaphors
- Compositional strategy library (1,747 lines, 6 named patterns) produces pattern-matching
- **SAME information. Different framing. Opposite creative outcomes.**

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) retrieves TOP-K most similar results (typically K=3-5).

If library has:
- 6 patterns → Agent sees top 3 matches
- 60 patterns → Agent sees top 3 matches
- 600 patterns → Agent sees top 3 matches

**Working memory constraint dominates.**

**From analogous domains (AI research):**

"n=3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus" (arXiv 2512.24120, 2025)

- 1-2 examples: insufficient guidance
- **3 examples: SWEET SPOT** (pattern recognition without collapse)
- 10+ examples: mode collapse toward frequent patterns

**Restricting access creates ignorance, not freedom.**

From jazz pedagogy: Charlie Parker practiced 15 hours/day, transcribed 100+ solos, learned 200+ standards — THEN "forgot all that and just wailed."

The knowledge was SUBSTRATE, not TEMPLATE.

**From art education:** Monet, Matisse, Courbet were academic students FIRST, avant-garde rebels SECOND. Rebellion FROM knowledge, not FROM ignorance.

**The principle:** Learn deeply, then access unconsciously (not mechanically).

### 1.4 The Anticipatory Nature

**This is a problem being solved BEFORE it manifests.**

Current state:
- 8 patterns documented (6 Tier 3 recipes + 2 implicit)
- 15 Track 2 layouts exist (tension-test + explorations)
- Pattern-matching hasn't YET become epidemic

**But the trajectory is clear:**

Phase C-I extraction will:
- Add 6 CD patterns (Phase G case studies)
- Document 3-5 additional patterns from OD/AD
- Potentially identify 10-15 new Track 2-worthy content pieces

**18 months from now:** 30+ patterns, 50+ Track 2 layouts built

**Without intervention:** Agents will pattern-match 60-80% of the time (predicted from cognitive mechanics + analogous domains research).

**The gravitational pull concern is ANTICIPATORY but VALID.**

The mechanisms designed in this research prevent the problem BEFORE it becomes endemic.

## 2. THE MECHANISM (Concrete Manifestation Paths)

### 2.1 All Dimensions Mapped

**18 dimensions across 6 meta-categories:**

#### TEMPORAL GRAVITY (4 dimensions)

**T1. Load-Order (HIGH gravity, addressable)**
- Patterns loaded EARLY anchor continuation chain
- First information becomes gravitational center
- **Manifestation:** Agent reads library in Phase 0 → pattern-matches during Phase 2

**T2. Pre/Mid/Post-Creative (HIGH gravity, partially addressable)**
- Pre-creative: planning/scoping — gravity from documented track splits
- Mid-creative: composition — gravity from patterns visible during metaphor search
- Post-creative: validation — gravity from success signals ("top 3 unchanged")
- **Manifestation:** Agent sees "geological" before analyzing content → immediate pattern-match

**T3. First-Mover Advantage (MEDIUM gravity, partially addressable)**
- Earlier-documented patterns have more gravity than recent ones
- DD-006 fractal has 20+ inbound refs (most-referenced artifact)
- **Manifestation:** First patterns establish conceptual territory others work around

**T4. Frequency-Over-Time (MEDIUM gravity, addressable)**
- Patterns used across MULTIPLE explorations accumulate temporal gravity
- Callouts appear in 38/39 files (8 months, ALL phases)
- **Manifestation:** Pervasive patterns perceived as validated/safe

#### SPATIAL GRAVITY (3 dimensions)

**S1. Early/Mid/Late Context (HIGH gravity, addressable)**
- Patterns in EARLY context (skill loading, first files) dominate late context
- **Manifestation:** Tier 1+2 always loaded → high gravity; Tier 3 late-loaded → lower gravity

**S2. Skill-Proximity (HIGH gravity, addressable)**
- Patterns IN skill file have procedural weight (instruction vs reference)
- **Manifestation:** If geological recipe in skill = procedural step; if in library = optional reference

**S3. Proximity-to-Task (MEDIUM gravity, partially addressable)**
- Patterns loaded NEAR creative prompt dominate distant patterns
- **Manifestation:** Compaction removes distant material; recent load = proximate to decision

#### VOLUMETRIC GRAVITY (3 dimensions)

**V1. Total Volume (MEDIUM gravity, addressable)**
- 100 lines on ONE pattern > 10 lines on 10 patterns
- **Manifestation:** Geological (150 lines) has more gravity than drop cap (70 lines)

**V2. Compression-Ratio (MEDIUM gravity, inherent)**
- Patterns with HIGH richness + LOW documentation = efficiency gravity
- **Manifestation:** Implicit metaphors perceived as elegant → attractive even when verbose better

**V3. Success-Signal (HIGH gravity, inherent)**
- Patterns marked "validated," "crown jewel," "top 3" create preference
- **Manifestation:** CD-006 (39/40 score) has gravity from success labeling

#### RELATIONAL GRAVITY (3 dimensions)

**R1. Cross-Reference (MEDIUM gravity, partially addressable)**
- DD-006 fractal: 20+ inbound refs = network centrality = default status
- **Manifestation:** All searches for "fractal" lead to DD-006

**R2. Circular Validation (LOW gravity, addressable)**
- Pattern A references B; B references A = mutual reinforcement
- **Manifestation:** Geological → Botanical; Botanical → Geological = circular validation

**R3. Dependency Chains (MEDIUM gravity, inherent)**
- Tier 3 → Tier 2.5 → Tier 2 → Tier 1 = structural gravity
- **Manifestation:** Tier 1 has maximum dependency gravity (every pattern requires tokens)

#### SEMANTIC GRAVITY (3 dimensions)

**F1. Prescriptive Framing (HIGH gravity, addressable)**
- "When to use: [criteria]" triggers lookup mode
- "Tension that produced this: [story]" triggers derivation mode
- **Manifestation:** SAME information, opposite creative outcomes

**F2. Specificity (MEDIUM gravity, partially addressable)**
- "4px border = 40px padding" (specific) has more gravity than "more certain = more breathing room" (principle)
- **Manifestation:** Specificity = apparent certainty = direct copy-paste

**F3. Naming Gravity (MEDIUM gravity, addressable)**
- "Geological Confidence Stratification" constrains to geological domain
- "Border-Weight Gradient" (mechanism) doesn't constrain application
- **Manifestation:** Builders perceive "my content isn't geological, can't use this"

#### INVISIBLE GRAVITY (2 dimensions)

**I1. Gap Gravity (HIGH gravity, addressable)**
- Gravity from what's NOT documented
- All 6 patterns are prose-heavy; ZERO data-heavy patterns
- **Manifestation:** Builders perceive "Track 2 is for narrative, not data"

**I2. Aesthetic Gravity (MEDIUM gravity, partially addressable)**
- Visual consistency in examples creates implicit aesthetic rules
- Purple accent: 20/39 files → builders perceive as "rare" → avoid it
- **Manifestation:** Unused palette colors feel "not part of system"

### 2.2 How Dimensions Compound

**Most Dangerous Combinations:**

1. **T1 (Load-order) × S1 (Early context) = CRITICAL**
   - Early load + early position = maximum pre-creative gravity
   - If library in Phase 0 + at top of context = double anchor

2. **S2 (Skill proximity) × F1 (Prescriptive) = CRITICAL**
   - Patterns in skill + prescriptive framing = procedural instruction
   - If "geological recipe" in SKILL.md = step to follow, not option

3. **I1 (Gap) × Completeness Perception = CRITICAL**
   - "Complete" library with gaps = "don't go there" signal
   - If all patterns are narrative → data-heavy feels wrong

**Compounding Effect Table:**

| Dimension Pair | Severity | How They Reinforce |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| T1 × S1 | CRITICAL | Early load + early position = maximum gravity |
| T2 × F1 | HIGH | Prescriptive patterns during planning = instruction |
| T3 × R1 | HIGH | First patterns accumulate references over time |
| V1 × F2 | MEDIUM | Large volume enables high specificity = certainty |
| V3 × T3 | HIGH | Early patterns validated first = permanent advantage |
| S2 × F1 | CRITICAL | Skill language + prescriptive = procedural |
| R1 × R2 | MEDIUM | Cross-refs + circular refs = closed loops |
| F3 × I1 | HIGH | Specific names + gaps = implicit boundaries |

### 2.3 Where on the Spectrum Gravity Becomes Load-Bearing

**The Cliff Location:**

```
BEFORE THE CLIFF (0-50% constraint):
- Tokens: 0% gravity
- Components: 10-20% gravity (default structures)
- Universal Mechanisms: 80-95% gravity BUT productive (grammar rules)
- Pattern-Specific Mechanisms: 30-50% gravity (optional techniques)

THE CLIFF (75-80% constraint):
- Patterns: metaphor-driven decisions

AFTER THE CLIFF (100% constraint):
- Compositions: unique outputs
```

**The transition is at LAYER 4 (patterns).**

Before: vocabulary and techniques (extractable, reusable, low-medium constraint)
After: decisions and outputs (metaphor-specific, high constraint)

**Evidence from tension-test:**

Boris content × 5 metaphors = 5 completely different page structures:
- Shared vocabulary: ~20-25% (tokens, components, base mechanisms)
- Metaphor-generated: ~75-80% (section labels, container hierarchy, visual flow)

**THE CLIFF IS REAL.**

Patterns don't constrain 10% more than mechanisms — they constrain 40-50% more. Vertical jump.

### 2.4 The Gravity Paradox

**The most USEFUL documents are the most GRAVITATIONAL.**

Why tension-composition skill works:
- 839 lines of precise guidance
- Exact thresholds (30%, 60%, ≥8 richness)
- 14-axis multi-axis questioning table
- Numeric scoring (0-20 richness scale)

This precision is what makes it USEFUL. Agents know EXACTLY what to do.

But this same precision creates gravitational mass:
- Thresholds become defaults (content at 35% feels "confused")
- Scores become optimization targets (aim for 15+ richness)
- Axes become templates (use these 14, not content-specific ones)

**The paradox: Making the skill less precise would destroy its utility.**

**The solution: SAME precision, DIFFERENT framing.**

## 3. THE SOLUTION (Targetable System)

### 3.1 Anti-Gravity Mechanisms (Ranked by Effectiveness)

**12 mechanisms across 3 categories:**

#### TIER 1: STRUCTURAL (Baked into architecture — work WITHOUT correct agent invocation)

**M1. Phase-Gated Library Access (★★★★★ — CRITICAL)**
- **What:** Library files physically separated; agents can't access during Phase 1-3 unless explicit Read
- **How:** Skill in `~/.claude/skills/`, library in `/active/design-system/library/` (separate files)
- **Effect:** Library UNAVAILABLE during creative phase → zero retrieval anchor
- **Addresses:** T1 (load-order), S1 (early context), S3 (proximity)
- **Scale:** Works BETTER as library grows (100 patterns = same barrier as 6)

**M2. Dual-File Split — Mechanisms vs Metaphors (★★★★★ — CRITICAL)**
- **What:** `MECHANISM-CATALOG.md` (reusable techniques) separate from `METAPHOR-CASE-STUDIES.md` (full explorations)
- **How:** Skill references ONLY mechanism catalog during Phase 4
- **Effect:** Mechanisms are TOOLS (low gravity), metaphors ISOLATED (high gravity, now inaccessible during creative phase)
- **Addresses:** Vocabulary vs Decisions split, F1 (framing), S2 (skill proximity)
- **Scale:** Perfect — mechanism catalog grows slowly (20 max), case studies grow infinitely but stay isolated

**M3. Anti-Prescription Headers (★★★★ — HIGH)**
- **What:** Every case study begins with "⚠️ NOT A TEMPLATE" warning
- **How:** Mandatory format: warning → tension narrative → mechanisms vs metaphor → divergence assignment
- **Effect:** "NOT A TEMPLATE" activates divergence mode before content read
- **Addresses:** F1 (framing), continuation bias
- **Scale:** Constant cost (one warning per pattern)

**M4. Tier Vocabulary Shift (★★ — MEDIUM)**
- **What:** Rename tier-1/tier-2/tier-3 → foundations/components/mechanisms/case-studies
- **How:** Directory restructure + remove numeric ordering
- **Effect:** Removes implied hierarchy (higher tier ≠ better)
- **Addresses:** Categorical gravity, perception
- **Scale:** One-time renaming, no ongoing impact

#### TIER 2: PROCEDURAL (Require correct prompting/workflow)

**M5. Binary Sequential Phase Rules (★★★★★ — CRITICAL)**
- **What:** Mandatory sequence: Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4, library prohibited until Phase 4
- **How:** "You MUST complete these in order. DO NOT consult library until AFTER Phase 4."
- **Effect:** Exploits "binary rules achieve 100% compliance" (metacognition finding from MEMORY.md)
- **Addresses:** T1 (load-order), T2 (pre-creative), timing control
- **Scale:** Independent of library size

**M6. Explicit Divergence Mandate (★★★★★ — HIGH)**
- **What:** Redefines success as "novel metaphor" not "good composition"
- **How:** "You are EXPECTED to derive metaphor NOT in library. Using library metaphor = pattern-matching."
- **Effect:** Success criteria exclude pattern-matching
- **Addresses:** F1 (framing), optimization target shift
- **Scale:** IMPROVES as library grows (convergence becomes statistically unlikely)

**M7. The Charlie Parker Instruction (★★★ — MEDIUM)**
- **What:** Explicit "forget the library" instruction during Phase 3
- **How:** "You have access to library. For Phase 3, FORGET it exists. Trust your query construction."
- **Effect:** Mirrors jazz pedagogy (learn → forget → apply)
- **Addresses:** T2 (pre-creative), explicit override
- **Scale:** Independent of library size

**M8. 3-Example Sampling (★★★★ — HIGH)**
- **What:** Load 2-4 MOST RELEVANT case studies (not all), selected by Weaver
- **How:** After Phase 4 commitment, Weaver selects samples based on tension similarity
- **Effect:** Leverages "n=3 sweet spot" from AI research (prevents mode collapse)
- **Addresses:** V1 (volume), mode collapse prevention
- **Scale:** IMPROVES as library grows (select 3 BEST from 100 vs all 6)

**M9. Divergence Verification Gate (★★★★ — MEDIUM-HIGH)**
- **What:** Metaphor novelty CHECK before implementation proceeds
- **How:** Phase 3.5 table: compare committed metaphor to library titles
- **Effect:** Makes pattern-matching VISIBLE, requires justification or regeneration
- **Addresses:** Visibility, enforcement gate
- **Scale:** Constant cost (single checkpoint)

#### TIER 3: HYBRID (Structural foundation + procedural activation)

**M10. Diversity Tracking Dashboard (★★★★ — HIGH, scales critically)**
- **What:** Registry tracks metaphor usage count + fatigue levels
- **How:** Weaver maintains `METAPHOR-REGISTRY.md` with usage counts, shows BEFORE Phase 3
- **Effect:** Repetition becomes VISIBLE not invisible anchor
- **Addresses:** T4 (frequency), V3 (success signal), visibility
- **Scale:** ESSENTIAL as library grows (with 100 pages, prevents invisible over-repetition)

**M11. Two-Phase Prompting (★★★★★ — VERY HIGH, architecturally complex)**
- **What:** Generation context separate from evaluation context (two turns or two agents)
- **How:** Phase A (library-blind derivation) → output commitment → Phase B (library-aware implementation)
- **Effect:** Exploits continuation bias (two-instance pattern from MEMORY.md)
- **Addresses:** T1 (load-order), working memory separation
- **Scale:** Independent of library size

**M12. Jazz Catalog Framing (★★★★ — HIGH)**
- **What:** Reframes library as "Real Book of standards" (gallery not menu)
- **How:** "Charlie Parker learned 200+ standards, did NOT play them verbatim. Your assignment: same."
- **Effect:** Library = proof gallery + toolbox, NOT template catalog
- **Addresses:** F1 (framing), conceptual positioning
- **Scale:** IMPROVES as library grows ("200+ standards" authentic at scale)

### 3.2 Timing Solutions

**The Master Variable:** WHEN patterns are consulted determines gravity more than WHAT they contain.

**Solution Architecture:**

```
Phase 0: Content Only
  ↓ (no library)
Phase 1-2: Skill Only (tension derivation)
  ↓ (no library)
Phase 3: Search Query Construction
  ↓ (no library)
Phase 3.5: Metaphor Commitment
  ↓ (no library)
Phase 4: Mechanism Extraction
  ↓ (NOW load MECHANISM-CATALOG.md)
Phase 5: Divergence Verification
  ↓ (NOW load METAPHOR-CASE-STUDIES.md)
Phase 6: Implementation
  ↓ (load foundations + components)
```

**Critical timing points:**

1. **Library OFF-LIMITS during Phase 1-3** — creative phase protected
2. **Commitment BEFORE library exposure** — prevents post-generation switching
3. **Mechanisms BEFORE metaphors** — tools before examples
4. **Verification LAST** — library for validation, not generation

**Enforcement:**

- **M1 (structural):** Files physically separated
- **M5 (procedural):** Binary sequential rule
- **M11 (hybrid):** Two-phase prompting

### 3.3 Framing Solutions

**The Framing Determinism:** "When to use" triggers lookup mode; "Tension that produced this" triggers derivation mode.

**Current (PRESCRIPTIVE):**
```markdown
### Tier 3 Recipe: Geological Stratification

**When to use:**
- Content has clear certainty gradients

**Composition recipe:**
1. Start with Tier 1 zone tokens
2. Apply Tier 2.5 confidence-encoding border weights
3. Set padding INVERSE to confidence: [specific values]
```

**Revised (ANTI-PRESCRIPTION GALLERY):**
```markdown
### Case Study: Geological Stratification (DD-004)

⚠️ **READ THIS FIRST — NOT A TEMPLATE**

This is proof that warmth/austerity tension CAN be resolved.
YOUR metaphor will be DIFFERENT.

**Tension That Produced This:**
[Full narrative of Phase 1-2 actual derivation for Boris content]

**The Search in Action:**
[Narrative — NOT recipe — of how metaphor emerged]

**What YOU Extract:**
- ✅ Mechanisms: border-weight gradient (reusable)
- ❌ Layout structure: 6-layer stratification (metaphor-specific)

**Your Divergence Assignment:**
If your metaphor is geological, ask: "Did I derive this independently or pattern-match?"
```

**Changes per case study:**
- "When to use" → "Tension that produced this" (specific, not criteria)
- "Composition recipe" → "What YOU extract" (mechanisms vs metaphor split)
- +100 lines: anti-prescription warning + divergence assignment

**Cost:** +600 lines total (6 recipes × 100 lines each)
**Benefit:** SAME information, opposite cognitive framing

**Enforcement:**

- **M3 (structural):** Headers baked into all case studies
- **M12 (hybrid):** Jazz framing throughout library

### 3.4 Scaling Solutions

**How the system adapts as library grows 8 → 30 → 100+ patterns:**

#### Mechanisms That IMPROVE With Scale:

**M6 (Divergence mandate):**
- At 8 patterns: convergence plausible (overlapping tensions)
- At 100 patterns: convergence statistically unlikely → stronger divergence signal
- **Effect:** Larger library = higher bar for "independent convergence"

**M8 (3-example sampling):**
- At 8 patterns: sample 3 of 8 (37% of library)
- At 100 patterns: sample 3 of 100 (3% of library)
- **Effect:** Better relevance filtering — select 3 MOST relevant instead of showing all

**M10 (Diversity tracking):**
- At 8 patterns: nice-to-have
- At 100 patterns: ESSENTIAL
- **Effect:** Prevents invisible over-repetition (4th use of geological visible)

**M12 (Jazz framing):**
- At 8 patterns: "200+ standards" feels artificial
- At 100 patterns: "200+ standards" feels authentic
- **Effect:** Framing becomes MORE credible at scale

#### Mechanisms That Remain CONSTANT:

**M1, M2, M5, M9, M11:** Same structural/procedural enforcement regardless of volume

#### Mechanisms That DEGRADE With Scale:

**M3 (Anti-prescription headers):**
- Warning impact dilutes if EVERY pattern has same warning (warning fatigue)
- **Mitigation:** Vary warning language across case studies

**M7 (Forget instruction):**
- Harder to "forget" 100-pattern library than 10-pattern library
- **Mitigation:** Rely on M1 (structural separation) more than M7 (instruction)

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The best mechanisms LEVERAGE scale, don't fight it. Anti-gravity uses volume as an asset.

### 3.5 The Jazz Analogy Made Concrete

**Charlie Parker's Method:**

1. **Learn standards deeply** (transcribe solos, practice 15 hours/day)
2. **Extract vocabulary** (harmonic patterns, rhythmic devices, melodic shapes)
3. **Forget during performance** ("forget all that and just wail")
4. **Apply vocabulary intuitively** (to new material, not standards verbatim)

**LLM Agent Equivalent:**

| Parker Phase | Agent Phase | Mechanism |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Learn standards | Read case studies library (Phase 5) | M12 (gallery framing) |
| Extract vocabulary | Read mechanism catalog (Phase 4) | M2 (mechanisms separate) |
| Forget during performance | Phase 1-3 (library-blind) | M1, M5, M11 (timing control) |
| Apply vocabulary intuitively | Phase 4 (use mechanisms) | M2 (mechanism catalog consulted) |

**The Critical Adaptation:**

Parker's "forget" was PSYCHOLOGICAL (internalized patterns so deeply he accessed them unconsciously).

LLM "forget" must be STRUCTURAL (library removed from context) because agents don't have unconscious access — they only have working memory.

**The timing separation (M1, M5, M11) is the agent equivalent of Parker's psychological "forget" moment.**

#### Anti-Gravity Framing Patterns

| Context | ❌ Weak | ✅ Strong |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Thresholds | ">60% is theoretical" | "In our analysis, >60% TENDED to be theoretical. This is a PATTERN not a rule." |
| Classifications | "Three types: A, B, C" | "We observed three clusters. These are ANALYTICAL GROUPINGS not natural categories." |
| Processes | "Follow these steps: 1, 2, 3" | "We followed this sequence. Your content may need different sequencing." |
| Examples | "When to use [pattern]: [criteria]" | "Tension that produced [pattern]: [specific]. If YOUR content similar, you MAY converge." |

### 4.3 Anti-Gravity Framing Templates

**For Mechanisms:**
- Frame as TECHNIQUES not REQUIREMENTS
- "Border-weight gradient — works for ANY hierarchy encoding"
- NOT "Use 4px/3px/1px borders for confidence"

**For Case Studies:**
- Frame as PROOF not TEMPLATES
- "Geological worked for THIS tension"
- NOT "When to use geological: [criteria list]"

**For Thresholds:**
- Frame as HEURISTICS not RULES
- "≥8 predicted productive metaphors in our samples"
- NOT "Richness ≥8 warrants Track 2"

**For Classifications:**
- Frame as OBSERVATIONS not CATEGORIES
- "We noticed three clusters"
- NOT "There are three types"

### 4.4 Skill Modifications

**Both skills (tension-composition + perceptual-auditing) need:**

1. **Timing Prohibitions**
   - "DO NOT consult [library] during [creative phase]"
   - Explicit sequencing rules

2. **Commitment Requirements**
   - "You MUST commit to [decision] BEFORE accessing [library]"
   - Lock-in mechanisms

3. **Divergence Verification**
   - Success check tables
   - Convergence vs pattern-matching distinction

4. **Explicit Diversity Rewards**
   - "Novel metaphors MORE valuable than optimal execution of known ones"
   - Growth > repetition framing

## 5. HONEST ASSESSMENT

### 5.1 What We're Confident About

**HIGH CONFIDENCE (backed by convergent evidence across multiple research files):**

1. **Volume is NOT the cause** (cognitive mechanics + analogous domains + spectrum analysis)
   - Framing matters 1000× more than volume
   - 3-example sweet spot empirically proven
   - Agents can have 100+ patterns and still generate fresh

2. **Timing is the master variable** (cognitive mechanics + mechanism design)
   - Library AFTER derivation = low gravity
   - Library BEFORE derivation = high gravity
   - First-read material becomes anchor (continuation bias)

3. **The gravity cliff is at patterns** (spectrum analysis + artifact audit)
   - Tokens/components/mechanisms = vocabulary (0-50% constraint)
   - Patterns = decisions (75-80% constraint)
   - Transition is VERTICAL not gradual

4. **Binary sequential rules work** (metacognition finding from MEMORY.md)
   - 100% compliance with explicit sequence rules
   - ~0% compliance with judgment rules
   - Make creative path = compliant path

5. **Framing determines cognitive mode** (cognitive mechanics)
   - "When to use" = lookup mode = pattern-matching
   - "Tension that produced this" = search mode = fresh generation
   - SAME information, opposite outcomes

**MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (strong evidence, needs validation):**

6. **The 12 mechanisms will work as designed**
   - Based on solid research (jazz pedagogy, AI mode collapse, LLM architecture)
   - But not yet TESTED empirically in this context
   - Need Phase F pilot validation

7. **Reframing eliminates gravity without reducing utility**
   - Theory is sound (SAME precision, DIFFERENT framing)
   - But requires testing: does anti-prescription framing actually prevent pattern-matching?
   - Or do agents ignore warnings?

8. **Diversity tracking prevents invisible repetition**
   - Makes sense (visibility creates awareness)
   - But requires Weaver maintenance
   - Solo agents won't have this mechanism

### 5.2 What's Uncertain and Needs Validation

**REQUIRES EMPIRICAL TESTING:**

1. **Do binary sequential rules ACTUALLY achieve 100% compliance with Sonnet/Opus agents in this context?**
   - MEMORY.md finding is about historical team behavior
   - May not generalize to this specific workflow
   - **Test:** Build 2 tracks (binary rule vs judgment rule), measure skip rate

2. **Is it exactly 3 examples, or a range 2-4?**
   - AI research cited n=3 for neural network generation
   - May differ for compositional metaphor selection
   - **Test:** Build same content with 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 examples shown

3. **Does anti-prescription framing actually work?**
   - "⚠️ NOT A TEMPLATE" might be too weak
   - Agents might ignore warnings
   - **Test:** Build with no warning, weak warning, strong warning, very strong warning

4. **What's the psychological effect of tier numbering vs functional naming?**
   - M4 assumes tier-1/2/3 creates hierarchy gravity
   - Does renaming to foundations/components/case-studies reduce it?
   - **Test:** Same library, two presentations (tier-X vs functional)

5. **Is two-phase prompting (M11) necessary?**
   - Architecturally complex (two turns or two agents)
   - Does single-phase with timing rules work just as well?
   - **Test:** Single-phase vs two-phase, measure novelty + quality

6. **What's the optimal mechanism bundle?**
   - All 12 mechanisms = maximum anti-gravity but high complexity
   - Essential bundle (M1, M5, M6) = minimum viable
   - What's the sweet spot?
   - **Test:** Deploy bundles incrementally, measure effectiveness at each tier

### 5.3 What Could Go Wrong

**FAILURE MODE 1: Procedural Compliance Failure**
- Agents skip Phase 1-3, read library immediately
- **Vulnerable mechanisms:** M5, M6, M7, M9 (all require compliance)
- **Mitigation:** Deploy structural mechanisms (M1, M2) as primary defense

**FAILURE MODE 2: Framing Ineffectiveness**
- Agents read warnings but interpret as weak suggestions
- **Vulnerable mechanisms:** M3, M12
- **Mitigation:** Combine framing (M3, M12) with enforcement (M5, M9)

**FAILURE MODE 3: Warning Fatigue**
- Agent sees same anti-prescription warning 50 times, stops reading carefully
- **Vulnerable mechanisms:** M3
- **Mitigation:** Vary warning language across case studies

**FAILURE MODE 4: Weaver Dependency**
- M8 (sampling) and M10 (tracking) fail if Weaver unavailable
- **Vulnerable mechanisms:** M8, M10
- **Mitigation:** Provide fallback solo agent workflow

**FAILURE MODE 5: Legitimized Convergence**
- Agent uses "independent convergence" exception to justify pattern-matching
- **Vulnerable mechanisms:** M6, M9
- **Mitigation:** Require STRONG justification, Weaver reviews claims

**FAILURE MODE 6: Scale Degradation**
- M3, M7 effectiveness decreases as library grows (100+ patterns)
- **Risk:** Warning fatigue, "forget" becomes implausible
- **Mitigation:** Rely more on structural mechanisms (M1, M2) at scale

### 5.4 What Requires Empirical Testing

**THE VALIDATION TEST (CRITICAL):**

Build the SAME content (warmth/austerity tension) with 4 variants:

**Variant A (Control):** Skill only, no library access
**Variant B (Weak Permission):** Skill + library + "consider as starting points"
**Variant C (Strong Intervention):** Skill + binary rules + anti-prescription library
**Variant D (Library-First):** Skill + library read before tension derivation

**Measure:**

| Metric | A | B | C | D |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| Metaphor novelty (0-5) | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Pattern library match (binary) | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Time to Phase 3 completion | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Perceptual audit score | ? | ? | ? | ? |

**Predicted outcomes:**
- **Variant A:** HIGH novelty, VARIABLE quality (no mechanism reuse)
- **Variant B:** LOW novelty (weak permission insufficient)
- **Variant C:** HIGH novelty, HIGH quality (intervention works)
- **Variant D:** ZERO novelty (all pattern-match to library)

**If Variant C achieves HIGH novelty + HIGH quality:**
The intervention is VALIDATED.

**If Variant C still shows pattern-matching:**
Framing is too weak. Increase prohibition strength or switch to M11 (two-phase prompting).

## 6. CONCLUSION

### The Definitive Answer

**Will agents default to known patterns?**

**YES — if patterns are framed as templates and available during generation.**

**NO — if patterns are framed as proof-of-concept and unavailable during derivation.**

### The Core Principle

**Pattern gravity is defeated through ARCHITECTURAL POSITIONING, not information restriction.**

Agents can have access to:
- 45 tokens
- 18 components
- 12 mechanisms
- 100+ patterns

**And STILL generate fresh compositions IF:**

1. **TIMING:** Patterns consulted AFTER metaphor derivation (M1, M5, M11)
2. **FRAMING:** Patterns positioned as gallery, not menu (M3, M12)
3. **SEPARATION:** Mechanisms (extractable) split from metaphors (inspirational) (M2)
4. **ENFORCEMENT:** Divergence required and verified (M6, M9)
5. **VISIBILITY:** Repetition tracked and visible (M10)

### The Six-Mechanism Model

Pattern defaulting is NOT a single phenomenon. It's the interaction of six cognitive mechanisms:

1. **Continuation Bias** → Control WHAT is read first (tension before library)
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** → Make library LOW-SIMILARITY to content (different framing)
3. **Pattern Recognition Priority** → Make matching HARD (warnings, prohibitions, verification)
4. **Working Memory Recency** → Control WHEN library enters context (after metaphor commitment)
5. **Binary Rule Compliance** → Make creative path the COMPLIANT path (Phase 1→2→3→4 sequence)
6. **Framing Effects** → Reframe library as gallery, not catalog

**Each mechanism has a targetable intervention.**

### The Jazz Model

Charlie Parker learned 200+ standards, practiced 15 hours a day — then "forgot all that and just wailed."

**The library should work the same way:**

- **Learn the patterns** (study case studies AFTER building)
- **Extract mechanisms** (border-weight, compression, 2-zone DNA)
- **Forget during creation** (Phase 1-3 library-blind)
- **Apply to new material** (Phase 4 mechanism consultation)

### Implementation Priority

**ESSENTIAL (deploy first):**
- M1: Phase-gated library access
- M2: Dual-file split (mechanisms vs metaphors)
- M5: Binary sequential rules
- M6: Divergence mandate

**ROBUST (deploy second):**
- M3: Anti-prescription headers
- M9: Verification gate
- M12: Jazz catalog framing

**ENHANCED (deploy third):**
- M8: 3-example sampling
- M10: Diversity tracking
- M11: Two-phase prompting

**Total implementation:** ~17 hours (Priority 1-3 changes)

### The Scaling Property

**The mechanisms designed here don't fight volume — they USE volume.**

As library grows 8 → 30 → 100+ patterns:
- M6 (divergence mandate) gets STRONGER
- M8 (3-example sampling) gets BETTER
- M10 (diversity tracking) becomes ESSENTIAL
- M12 (jazz framing) becomes AUTHENTIC

**The system scales WITH the library, not AGAINST it.**

### Final Word

**Pattern gravity is not inevitable. It's a design choice.**

The gravitational pull concern is REAL, ANTICIPATORY, and SOLVABLE.

This document provides:
- ✅ Deep understanding of the problem (6 cognitive mechanisms, 18 dimensions)
- ✅ Concrete manifestation paths (how gravity operates)
- ✅ Complete solution system (12 mechanisms, 3 tiers)
- ✅ Detailed enrichment plan (file-by-file, prioritized)
- ✅ Honest assessment (what's confident, what needs testing)
- ✅ Empirical validation protocol (4-variant test)

**The mechanisms are ready to deploy. The architecture is ready to build.**

Pattern defaulting is defeated.

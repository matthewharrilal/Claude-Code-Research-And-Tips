            Each wave represents a ~5x productivity multiplier. Wave 4 (agents) is 25x over manual coding. Wave 5 (clusters) is 125x. Most organizations are still at Wave 3 (chat). The competitive gap is widening exponentially.

          <div class="decision-reasoning">
            "Almost everyone starts with LangChain or similar frameworks. Almost everyone eventually strips them out." Production is FastAPI and direct API calls. Frameworks add abstraction that obscures failure modes. Wrappers hide the physics of the system.

              Build orchestration platforms, not prompt templates. Frameworks are for demos. Production requires understanding the raw mechanics. Every wrapper you add is a failure mode you can't debug.

          <div class="decision-reasoning">
            Research shows error amplification is 17.2x for independent agents but only 4.4x for centralized orchestration. The Iron Law exists because mixing coordination and execution creates feedback loops that spiral into chaos.

          <div class="gotcha-detail">
            <strong>The cost:</strong> $47,000 in accumulated API charges.

            <strong>The fix:</strong> Monitoring and cost caps are non-negotiable. Never run autonomous agents without circuit breakers.

            <strong>The math:</strong> "Even if you're optimistic and assume each step succeeds 95% of the time, a 20-step workflow only has about a 36% chance of finishing without error."
          </div>
          <div class="gotcha-detail">
            <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Production aims for 99.9%+ reliability. Agents are nowhere near that.

          <div class="gotcha-detail">
            <strong>The fix:</strong> Decompose into smaller verified units. Add retry logic with exponential backoff. Expect failures and design for recovery.

            <strong>Cause:</strong> Usually jumping to complexity (Wave 4-5) before team masters basics (Wave 3), no shared vocabulary, or insufficient tooling.

            The Trust Problem
          </div>
          <div class="hard-detail">
            <strong>The tension:</strong> Agents are powerful but unreliable. You can't trust anything—you have to validate and verify. But verification at scale is expensive.
          </div>
          <div class="hard-detail">
            <strong>Why it's hard:</strong> Trust is the number one thing keeping the industry from rocketing forward. The gap between what agents CAN do and what you can TRUST them to do is enormous.
          </div>
          <div class="hard-detail">
            <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Build trust incrementally. Start with HOTL (Human On The Loop). Graduate to autonomous only for verified domains. Never trust security-critical operations.

            <strong>Why it's hard:</strong> The adoption gap between early adopters and mainstream is massive. Most organizations are still at Wave 3 while the frontier is at Wave 5-6.

## Core Insight

> "you're a few .md files from being able to outperform 99% of people on this planet"

---

## The Principle

Markdown files as **structured knowledge bases** for AI tools:
- Better context management
- Automation via skills
- Agentic workflows
- 80% better first-try outputs

## Thread Gold: What .md Files Do

**@itsmechase (Beginner explainer):**
> "It's a plain text file for writing nicely formatted notes... Most planning docs are created in a markdown file that coding agents can read to complete work"

**@advait_jayant:**
> "structured context is the highest leverage asset you can own right now. the gap between those who curate their personal data and those who don't is widening fast."

**@is_lu_is:**
> "Switched my life to markdown + AI a while ago - projects, decisions, ideas, all in .md - feels a bit like cheating"

## Concrete Applications

### 1. Vibe Skills (thevibemarketer.com/skills)
10 .md-based Claude skills for marketing:
- Brand Voice
- Keyword Research
- Positioning
- Content Strategy
- + Creative Pack for asset generation

Upload once → auto-references in chats.

### 2. MDFlow (mdflow.dev)
Treat .md files as CLI-executable scripts:

```markdown
---
model: sonnet
---
Write a short poem about {argument}.
```

Run: `mdflow poem.claude` or `./poem.claude.md`

Pipe outputs: `./tree.gemini.md | ./md-to-html.gemini.md`

---

## The Framework

**@elliot_garreffa visual:**
```
Project → Dedicated workspace (Claude Projects)
    ↓
Skill → Step-by-step instructions (Claude Skills = .md files)
    ↓
MCP → External tool access (Zapier, APIs)
    ↓
Agent → Autonomous workers (Researcher, Writer)
```

Skills are **recipes** that load on demand based on query relevance.

## @grok's Money-Making Examples

1. `freelancing.md` - List gigs on Upwork
2. `AI_tools.md` - Track trends for newsletter/YouTube
3. `side_hustles.md` - Brainstorm products, validate, sell on Gumroad

Use Obsidian or VS Code to manage.

## Mental Model

> "View .md as building blocks for an AI-enhanced personal OS – like hiring specialists that reference your curated context on demand."

**Key principles:**
- Structure beats chaos
- Upload once, benefit forever
- Composability (pipe outputs)
- Minimalism (few files yield 99% outperformance)

---

## Caveats

- Skills may not auto-trigger on ambiguous queries
- Large .md files can hit context limits
- MDFlow requires CLI comfort + API keys

---

## Actionability

🟢 **Quick Win** - Upload a few .md skills to Claude and test

### Instant Start
1. Create `brand-voice.md` with your tone/style
2. Upload to Claude as skill
3. Ask Claude to write something
4. Watch it auto-reference your voice

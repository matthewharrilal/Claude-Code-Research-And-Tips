## Key Themes Across These Voices

### 1. Swarm/Hive Architectures
Moving from single agents to coordinated swarms. Not just "run two Claude instances" but actual coordination protocols.

### 2. Infrastructure Over Wrappers
Building orchestration platforms, not just prompt templates. The future isn't better prompts—it's better infrastructure.

### 3. Production at Scale
Focus on reliability, observability, and enterprise deployment. Demo code doesn't cut it.

### 4. Hidden Features
Reverse-engineering and enabling disabled capabilities. Claude Code has more inside than the docs reveal.

### 5. Systems Thinking
Applying distributed systems concepts to agents: consensus, coordination, failure handling, state management.

### 6. Management Paradigm Shift
Thinking like a tech lead managing AI teams, not a developer using AI tools.
